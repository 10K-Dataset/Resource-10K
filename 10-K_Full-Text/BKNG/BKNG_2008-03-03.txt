PART I

Item 1.  Business

General

We
are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of
travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation
packages, cruises and destination services. 
In the United States, we offer our customers a unique choice: the
ability to purchase travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or
the opportunity to use our unique

Name Your
Own Price

®

service, which allows our customers to make
offers for travel services at discounted prices.  Internationally, we offer our customers hotel
room reservations in over 60 countries and 22 languages.

We launched our business in
the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded
our operations to include, among others, the brands Booking.com and Active
Hotels in Europe and Agoda in Asia.  Our
goal is to be the leading worldwide online hotel reservation service and be the
top online discount travel agent in the United States.  At present, we derive substantially all of
our revenues from the following sources:

·

Transaction
revenues from our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket, hotel room and rental car
services, as well as our vacation packages service;

·

Commissions
earned from the sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and
other travel services;

·

Customer
processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both

Name Your Own Price

®

and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel
rooms and rental cars services. 
Priceline eliminated processing fees for its price-disclosed airline
ticket service in June 2007;

·

Transaction
revenue from our price-disclosed merchant hotel room service;

·

Global
distribution system (“GDS”) reservation booking fees related to both our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket, hotel room and rental car
services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and

·

Other revenues
derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites.


For
the year ended December 31, 2007, we had revenues of approximately $1.4
billion comprised of “merchant” revenue, “agency” revenue and “other”
revenue.  Merchant revenues are derived
from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for,
among other things, collecting receipts from our customers and remitting
payments to our suppliers.  Merchant
revenues, which represented the substantial majority of our total revenues in
2007, consisted of: (1)

transaction revenues representing the selling
price of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and
price-disclosed vacation packages services; (2) transaction revenues
representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by
suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant
price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in
connection with the sale of

Name Your Own
Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars
and merchant price-disclosed hotels services; and (4) ancillary fees,
including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the transactions
described above

.  Agency
revenues are generally derived from retail travel related transactions where we
are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are
determined by third parties. Agency revenues consisted primarily of: (1) travel
commissions; (2) customer processing fees; and (3) GDS reservation
booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions.

Other revenues consisted
primarily of revenue from advertising on our websites.

Priceline.com
was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1997 and was converted
into a Delaware corporation in July 1998. 
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the
symbol “PCLN.”  Our principal executive
offices are located at 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 06854.

The priceline.com Business
Model

We
offer customers the ability

to make hotel reservations on a worldwide
basis primarily under the Booking.com and Agoda brands internationally and
primarily under the priceline.com brand in the United States.  In the United States, we also offer customers
the ability to purchase other travel services, including airline tickets,
rental car days, vacations packages, destination services and cruises, through
both a traditional, price-disclosed “retail” manner, and through our
proprietary demand-collection system known as

Name Your
Own Price

®

.  These services are made available over the
Internet through websites that we own or control, and are provided by major
travel suppliers, including more than 60,000 hotel properties worldwide.  We believe that the combination of our retail
price-disclosed

model and our

Name
Your Own Price

®

model allows us to provide a
broad array of options to value-conscious travelers, while providing us with
diverse streams of revenue.

International: Price-Disclosed Hotel Services

.  We offer a retail, price-disclosed hotel
service in Europe and Asia through our international operations, which we have
developed through recent acquisitions. 
In September 2004, we acquired Booking.com Limited, a Cambridge,
England-based Internet hotel reservation distributor, and in July 2005, we
acquired Amsterdam-based Booking.com
B.V., one of continental Europe’s leading Internet hotel reservation services,
with offices primarily in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Loule, Paris, Rome and
Vienna.  All of our European operations,
including Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V., are majority-owned by
us.  In November 2007, we acquired Agoda
Company, Ltd. (“Agoda”) and AGIP LLC (“AGIP,” and together with Agoda, the “Agoda
Companies”), an Internet hotel
distributor with operations in Singapore and Thailand.  We work with over 60,000 chain-owned and
independently owned hotels offering hotel reservations on various websites and
in multiple languages.  For geographic related information, see
Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our
international business — the significant majority of which is currently
generated by our European operations — represented approximately 55% of our
gross bookings in the year ended December 31, 2007, and contributed more
than two-thirds of our consolidated operating income during that period.  We expect that throughout 2008 and beyond,
our international operations will represent a growing percentage of our total
gross bookings and operating income.


United States: Retail Travel Services

.  In the United States, we offer customers the
ability to purchase price-disclosed hotel rooms, airline tickets, rental car
days, vacation packages, destination services and cruises at retail
prices.  In these transactions, the
customer typically selects airline flights, hotel reservations, rental car or
other travel itineraries from an array of results produced in response to the
customer’s request.  These results
include the identity of the travel supplier, the exact price

of the
itinerary, and other details relating to the itineraries.  In some circumstances, the customer pays us
at the time of reservation, and in other circumstances, the customer pays the
travel supplier directly at the time of travel.

United States: Name Your Own Price

®

Travel Services

.  We have developed a unique pricing system
known as a “demand collection system” that uses the information sharing and
communications power of the Internet to create a different way of pricing
services.  We believe our services have
created a balance between the interests of buyers, who are willing to accept
trade-offs in order to save money, and sellers, who are prepared to generate
incremental revenue by selling their services at below retail prices, provided
that they can do so without disrupting their existing distribution channels or
retail pricing structures.  Our demand
collection system allows consumers to specify the price they are prepared to
pay when submitting an offer for a particular leisure travel service.  We then access databases in which
participating suppliers file secure discounted rates not generally available to
the public, to determine whether we can fulfill the customer’s offer and decide
whether we want to accept the offer at the price designated by the
consumer.  For most of these
transactions, we have discretion in supplier selection and are the merchant of
record in the transaction.  Consumers
agree to hold their offers open for a specified period of time (generally, not
longer than one minute) to enable us to determine whether we can or want to accept
the offer.  Once fulfilled, offers generally
cannot be canceled — thereby making such purchases generally
non-refundable.  This system uses the
flexibility of buyers to enable sellers to accept a lower price in order to
sell their excess capacity.  We believe
that our demand collection system addresses limitations inherent in traditional
seller-driven pricing mechanisms in a manner that offers substantial benefits
to both buyers and sellers.  We believe
that the principal advantages of our system include the following:

·

Cost
Savings

.  Our

Name Your Own Price

®

demand
collection system allows consumers to save money in a simple and compelling
way.  Buyers effectively trade off
flexibility about brands, service features and/or sellers in return for prices
that are lower than those that can be obtained at that time through traditional
retail distribution channels.

·

Incremental
Revenue for Sellers

.  Sellers use
our

Name Your Own Price

®

demand collection system as
a revenue management tool to generate incremental revenue without disrupting
their existing distribution channels or retail pricing structures.  We require consumers to be flexible with
respect to brands and service features. 
As a result, our

Name Your Own Price

®

system does not reveal sellers’ brands to
customers prior to the consummation of a transaction, thereby protecting their
brand integrity.  This shielding of brand
identity and price enables sellers to sell services at discounted prices
without cannibalizing their own retail sales by publicly announcing discount
prices and without competing against their own distributors.

·

Proprietary
Seller Networks

.  We have
assembled proprietary networks of industry leading sellers that represent high
quality brands.  By establishing
attractive networks of seller participants with reputations for quality, scale
and national presence, we believe that we foster increased participation by
both buyers and sellers.

We
often refer to services offered through our

Name
Your Own Price

®

service as “opaque” services
because all aspects of the travel service are not visible to the consumer
before making an offer.


The priceline.com Strategy

The
online travel category has continued to experience significant worldwide growth
as consumer purchasing shifts from traditional off-line channels to interactive
online channels.  Priceline.com has been
a leader in the deep discount segment of this market in the United States and
in the hotel reservation market internationally.  Our strategy is to continue to participate
broadly in online travel growth by expanding our service offerings and markets.

·

Become the
Leading Worldwide Online Hotel Reservation Service

.  The size of the travel market outside of the
United States is substantially greater than that within the United States.  Historically, Internet adoption rates and
e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the
United States.  However, international consumers
are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel.  Accordingly, recent international online
travel growth rates have substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to
exceed the growth rates within the United States.  Prior to 2004, substantially all of our
revenues were generated within the United States.  For the year ended December 31, 2007, o

ur international
business — the significant majority of which is currently generated by our
European operations — represented approximately 55% of our gross bookings, and
contributed more than two-thirds of our consolidated operating income during
that period.  We expect that throughout
2008 and beyond, our international operations will represent a growing
percentage of our total gross bookings and operating income.

Because of what we believe
to be superior growth rate opportunities associated with international online
travel, we intend to continue to invest resources to increase the share of our
revenues represented by international consumers and capitalize on international
travel demand.

We
believe that the positioning of our Booking.com hotel reservation service gives
us a foothold into a broader international market.  We intend to use the Agoda Companies, our
recently acquired online hotel distributor with operations in Singapore and
Thailand, to further develop our operations throughout Asia, where Internet
penetration is growing at a substantially greater pace than in the United
States over the last several years.  We
have begun, and intend to continue, development of the means to share hotel
availability among our brands, which we believe will allow us to monetize
demand across international markets.  In
addition, from time to time we explore strategic transactions and acquisitions
that, among other things, allow us to provide our services to new markets.  We believe that by promoting our brands
worldwide, sharing hotel supply and customer flow and applying our industry
experiences in the United States and Europe to other international regions, we
can further expand our service internationally and become the leading worldwide
online hotel reservation service.

Continue to
be One of the Top Online Travel Businesses in North America for Value-Conscious
Leisure Travelers

.  Our

Name Your Own Price

®

demand collection system in the United States
allows consumers to save money in a simple and compelling way.  Buyers effectively trade off flexibility
about brands, service features and/or sellers in return for prices that are
lower than those that can be obtained at that time through traditional retail
distribution channels.  We have expended
significant resources to allow us to introduce price-disclosed retail services
in the United States to our consumers to compliment the

Name Your Own Price

®

service. 
We believe that by offering a “one-stop-shopping” solution to our
customers, we can simultaneously fulfill the needs of those customers who are
prepared to accept the unique restrictions of our

Name Your Own Price

®

service in exchange for receiving significant
savings relative to retail prices, as well as those customers who are less
price sensitive and require the certainty of knowing the full details of their
travel itinerary prior to purchasing.  In
June 2007, we eliminated booking fees on price-disclosed retail airline
tickets as part of our strategy to provide value to our customers.


We
intend to enhance our service offerings continually, particularly our retail
offerings, by adding competitive functionality, adding competitive content at
competitive pricing, adding and improving the content and merchandising on our website
as well as cross-sell opportunities to maximize customer conversion.

·

Competitive
functionality:

We continue to expend significant resources to
remain competitive in terms of the features and functionality we offer our
customers.  For example, since launching
our domestic retail air service, we added the ability to search for flexible
dates or alternative airports, book one-way and multi-destination itineraries
and easily make modifications to search criteria.  We intend to add additional functionality
such as the ability to search child and senior fares and to access real time
seat maps.

·

Competitive
selection and pricing:

We believe that having a wide selection of
travel options at competitive pricing is critical to our success.  For example, in June of 2007, we
eliminated booking fees on price-disclosed retail airline tickets, added
JetBlue fares to both our retail price-disclosed and

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket services and
added over 10,000 additional hotels to our domestic vacation package service.
In addition, we have renewed or entered into new agreements with several of our
major airline and hotel suppliers, which we believe improved our access to a
better selection of travel alternatives and pricing.

·

Content
and merchandising:

As part of our evolution to a “one-stop-shopping”
website, we have added thousands of pages of content to allow customers to
research destinations and hotel properties before booking a reservation.  We offer property descriptions, maps, images,
and user reviews whereby our customers can benefit from the experiences and
opinions of other customers.  In the
United States, we introduced “PriceBreakers

sm

,” which is a
presentation of selected travel itineraries at discounted prices that is
updated daily.  We intend to continue to
improve our content and merchandising with more comprehensive descriptions,
more and higher quality images, and more user reviews, which we believe will
improve conversion of users shopping on our website.

·

Cross-sell
opportunities

: We also cross-sell different travel components to
maximize the revenue we generate from each customer in the United States.  We have developed and implemented
functionality that allows customers to “add-on” travel components to their
selection, both during the shopping experience and at time of purchase.  For example, customers can add a rental car
reservation to their air or hotel reservation, or a hotel reservation to their
air reservation.  Customers can also add
destination related services such as shuttles, tours and activities.  Additionally, we cross-sell opaque services
on our retail path and retail services on our opaque path.  For example, an unsuccessful opaque air
customer may be offered a price-disclosed alternative, while a retail hotel shopper
may be offered the

Name Your Own Price

®

alternative for greater
savings.  We intend to further enhance
these cross-sell opportunities across all of our services.

We
strive to be the preferred discount distribution channel in the United States
for airlines, hotels and rental car companies. 
Our

Name Your Own Price

®

service protects supplier brand and published
pricing and our packages and other merchandising provide access to the brand
neutral leisure traveler at attractive distribution costs.


Service Offerings — International

Retail Hotels.

We offer a retail,
price-disclosed hotel service in Europe and Asia, primarily through our
Booking.com and Agoda brands.  We operate
our international operations through

Booking.com Limited and
Booking.com B.V. in Europe and the Agoda Companies in Asia.  Through these operations, we work with over 60,000 chain-owned and
independently owned hotels offering hotel reservations on various websites and
in multiple languages.

Service Offerings — United States

Name Your Own Price

®

Hotels

.  Through our

Name
Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation
service, customers can make reservations at hotel properties in substantially
all major cities and metropolitan areas in the United States and Europe.  Most significant national hotel chains as
well as several important real estate investment trusts and independent
property owners participate in our

Name Your
Own Price

®

service. 
Hotels participate by filing secure private discounted rates with
related rules in a global distribution system database.  These specific rates generally are not
available to the general public or to consolidators and other discount
distributors who sell to the public, however, hotel participants may make
similar rates available to consolidators or other discount providers under
other arrangements.

To
make an offer, a customer specifies: (1) the city and neighborhood in
which the customer wants to stay, (2) the dates on which the customer
wishes to check in and check out, (3) the “class” of service (1, 2, 3, 4,
5-star or “resort”), (3) the price the customer is willing to pay, and (4) the
customer’s valid credit card to guarantee the offer.  When making an offer, consumers must agree to
stay at any one of our participating hotel partners and accept a reservation
that cannot be refunded or changed.  The
target market for our

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation service is the leisure
travel market.

Retail Hotels.

We also operate a price-disclosed hotel service
in the United States that enables our customers to

select the exact hotel they
want to book and the price of the reservation is disclosed prior to purchase.

Name Your Own Price

®

Airline
Tickets

.  There are a total of 13
domestic airlines and 26 international airlines participating in our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service.

Our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service operates in a manner
similar to our

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation service.  To make an offer, a customer specifies: (1) the
origin and destination of the trip, (2) the dates on which the customer
wishes to depart and return, (3) the price the customer is willing to pay,
and (4) the customer’s valid credit card to guarantee the offer.  When making an offer, consumers must agree
to:

·

fly on any one of our
participating airline partners;

·

leave at any time of day
between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on their desired dates of departure and
return;

·

purchase only round trip
coach class tickets between the same two points of departure and return;

·

accept at least one stop or
connection;

·

receive no frequent flier
miles or upgrades; and

·

accept tickets that cannot
be refunded or changed.


If
a customer’s offer is not accepted, but we believe the offer is reasonably
close to a price that we would be willing to accept, we will attempt to satisfy
the customer by providing guidance to the customer indicating that changing
certain parameters of the offer would increase the chances of the offer being
accepted.  For example, in some cases we
disclose to the customer that agreeing to fly into an alternate airport would
increase the chances of his or her offer being accepted.  In other cases, we inform the customer that
increasing his or her offer by a certain amount would increase the chances of
it being accepted.  We may also offer a
customer the opportunity to purchase a price-disclosed retail airline ticket.

Retail Airline Tickets.

We also offer

our customers in the United
States the ability to purchase retail airline tickets at disclosed prices and
with disclosed itineraries.  The airline
sets the retail price paid by the consumer and is the merchant of record for
the transaction.  These airline tickets
do not have the restrictions associated with our

Name Your
Own Price

®

service. 
For example, in addition to having fully disclosed itineraries, retail
airline tickets are generally changeable and cancellable for a fee.  In June 2007, we eliminated booking fees
we had previously charged on the sale of retail airline tickets.

Name Your Own Price

®

Rental Cars

.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

rental car service operates in a
manner similar to our hotel reservation and airline ticket services.  Our rental car services are currently available
in substantially all major United States airport markets.  The top five brand name airport rental car
companies in the United States are seller participants in our rental car
program.  Consumers can access our
website and select where and when they want to rent a car, what kind of car
they want to rent (e.g., economy, compact, mid-size, SUV, etc.) and the price
they want to pay per-day, excluding taxes, fees and surcharges.  When we receive an offer, we determine whether
to fulfill the offer based upon the available rates and rules.  If a customer’s offer is accepted, we will
immediately reserve the rental car, charge the customer’s credit card and
notify the customer of the rental car company and location providing the rental
car.

Retail Rental Cars.

We also offer a price-disclosed rental car
service

on www.priceline.com that enables our customers

in the United
States

to choose between price-disclosed or

Name
Your Own Price

®

rental cars.  Our price-disclosed rental car service
operates under the agency model,

under which we earn a
commission upon rental car return, and

accommodates one-way and
off-airport reservations

.

As with our
retail airline ticket and hotel reservation services, rental car reservations
booked in a retail manner do not have the restrictions associated with

our

Name
Your Own Price

®

service. 
Customers can select the exact car they want to book and the price of
the reservation is disclosed prior to purchase.

With
respect to each of our airline, hotel and rental car services, we believe the
combination of our

Name Your Own Price

®

model and the retail model
allows us to provide a broad array of options to value-conscious travelers,
while providing us with diverse streams of revenue.

Vacation Packages

.  Our vacation package service allows consumers

in the United States

to purchase packages consisting of airfare,
hotel and rental car components. 
Consumers can select the exact hotel or resort that they want to
reserve, and then, in most cases, select either a retail airline ticket or an opaque
airline ticket for the air component of their package.  Additionally, consumers can add destination
related services such as tours, shuttles, and activities.  Vacation packages are sold at disclosed
prices, although consumers cannot determine the exact price of the individual
components.

Destination Services

.  We currently offer customers

in the United
States

the opportunity to purchase destination services such as event tickets,
ground transfers, tours, restaurant meals and other services available at their
travel destinations.  This service is
offered to consumers as part of the process of booking an air, hotel and
vacation reservation, and also as a standalone service.  In certain locations, we also offer parking
and expanded ground transfer options.


Cruises

.  We
also offer price-disclosed cruise trips through National Leisure Group, Inc.
(“NLG”), an agent representing major cruise lines.  Our cruise service allows consumers

in the United
States

to search for and compare cruise pricing and availability information
from 17 cruise lines, and to purchase cruises online or through a call center
by selecting from our published offerings and prices.  We receive commissions from NLG on successful
cruise bookings.

Travel Insurance

.  We offer our air, hotel and vacation package
customers

in the United States

an optional travel insurance package that
provides coverage for, among other things, trip cancellation, trip
interruption, medical expenses, emergency evacuation, and loss of baggage,
property and travel documents.  The
travel insurance is provided by member companies of American International
Group, Inc. (“AIG”).  We receive a
percentage of the premium from AIG member companies for every optional insurance
package purchased by our customers.

While
we are currently focused on the travel services described above, over time, we
may evaluate the introduction of other services that we believe could enhance
the travel experience of our customers.

Financial Services

We
offer financial services through Priceline Mortgage Company LLC, d/b/a
pricelinemortgage.com, of which we own 49% and hold two of five seats on the
board of managers.  Pursuant to an intellectual property license from us,
pricelinemortgage.com utilizes the priceline.com

allows consumers to access attractive financial services including, but not
limited to, mortgages, home equity loans, and banking service.  We record our proportionate share of the
results of pricelinemortgage.com as equity in income (loss) of investees and
minority interests.

Marketing and Brand
Awareness

Priceline.com
and Booking.com have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands
through aggressive marketing and promotion campaigns.  During 2007, our total online and offline
advertising expenses were approximately $172.7 million and $36.0 million,
respectively, a substantial portion of which was spent internationally.  We intend to continue a marketing strategy to
promote brand awareness and the concept that consumers can save money using our
services.  Underlying our marketing
strategy is our belief that our target market is all consumers, not just
Internet-savvy consumers.  We intend to
continue to promote the Booking.com, priceline.com and Agoda brands
aggressively throughout 2008.

As
our international operations become more meaningful contributors to our
results, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in our
advertising expense.  Specifically,
because our international operations utilize online affiliate marketing and
Internet search engines, principally through the purchase of travel-related
keywords, as principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our


online
advertising expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of those
companies, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2008.

In
addition, we generate advertising revenue by selling advertising to travel
suppliers and others on our owned websites in the United States.

Competition

We compete with both online and traditional sellers of the services we
offer. The market for the services we offer is intensely competitive, and
current and new competitors can launch new sites at a relatively low cost. In
addition, the major online travel companies with which we compete have
significantly greater financial resources and capital than we do.  We may not be able to effectively compete
with industry conglomerates such as Travelport, Sabre or Expedia, each of which
have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do.

We currently or potentially
compete with a variety of companies with respect to each service we offer. With
respect to our travel services, these competitors include, but are not limited
to:

·

Internet travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, which are
owned by Expedia; Travelocity and lastminute.com, which are owned by the Sabre
Group; Orbitz.com, Cheaptickets, ebookers, HotelClub and RatesToGo, which are
currently owned by Orbitz Worldwide; laterooms and asiarooms owned by Tui
Travel, and Gullivers, octopustravel, Superbreak, Venere, hotel.de, Hotel
Reservation Service and Wotif;

·

travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel companies and rental car
companies, many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive
business;

·

large online portal and search companies, such as AOL (including AOL
Travel), Yahoo! (including Yahoo! Travel) and Google;

·

traditional travel agencies;

·

online travel search sites such as Mobissimo.com, FareChase.com, Kayak.com
and Kayak.com’s recent acquisition, SideStep.com (each sometimes referred to as
“meta-search”) and travel research sites that have search functionality, such
as TripAdvisor, Travelzoo and Cheapflights.com; and

·

operators of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo,
Worldspan, L.P., Amadeus and Sabre.

Many airline, hotel and
rental car suppliers, including suppliers with which we conduct business, are
focusing on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party
distributors such as us.  Certain
suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book
airline reservations through an online channel other than their own website.  Furthermore, several low cost airlines, which
are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their tickets
exclusively through their own websites. 
Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a
processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as bonus miles or
loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers
than models like ours.

We potentially face
competition from a number of large Internet companies and services that have
expertise in developing online commerce and in facilitating Internet traffic,
including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and Yahoo!, which compete with us
either directly or indirectly through affiliations with other e-commerce or
off-line companies.  We also compete with
“meta-search” companies, which are companies that leverage their search
technology to aggregate travel search results


across supplier, travel agent and other
websites.  For example, Yahoo! owns
FareChase.com, a travel search-engine that searches for fares and hotel rates
at travel supplier and third-party websites, and refers traffic to those sites,
and AOL is party to a marketing and technology agreement, and holds a minority
interest in, Kayak.com, another leading meta-search company.  Other established search engine companies as
well as start-ups are attempting to enter the online travel marketplace in this
manner.  If Yahoo!, Google or other
portals decide to refer significant traffic to travel search engines, it could
result in more competition from supplier websites and higher customer
acquisition costs for third-party sites such as ours. In addition, because we
advertise on certain meta-search sites, a loss of business for competitive
reasons could result.  Competition from
these and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Many of our current and
potential competitors, including Internet directories, search engines and large
traditional retailers, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases,
greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing,
personnel, technical and other resources than priceline.com. Some of these
competitors may be able to secure services on more favorable terms than we can.
In addition, many of these competitors may be able to devote significantly
greater resources to:

·

marketing and promotional campaigns;

·

attracting traffic to their websites;

·

attracting and retaining key employees;

·

securing vendors and supply; and

·

website and systems development.

Increased competition could result in reduced operating margins, loss
of market share and damage to our brand. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. See “

Risk Factors — Intense competition could reduce our market share and
harm our financial performance

Operations and Technology

Our business is supported by
a systems platform, which was designed with an emphasis on scalability,
performance and reliability.  The
software platform and architecture are built on server-side Java, C++, ASP, &
Perl, and SQL scripts integrated with Oracle & MYSQL relational
database systems.  This internal platform
was designed to include open application protocol interfaces that can provide
connectivity to vendors in the industries in which we operate.  These include large global systems, such as
airline and hotel room reservation systems and financial service providers, as
well as individual suppliers, such as individual hotels.  Our Internet servers utilize digital certificates
to help us conduct secure communications and transactions, as appropriate.

The
systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our international
operations are primarily hosted at Equinix Europe Ltd., in London, England, and
Global Switch Amsterdam B.V. and TelecityRedbus, in the Netherlands. Each
location has backup generators and infrastructure typical of hosted data
centers.

Our
systems infrastructure and web and database servers in the U.S. are hosted at
SAVVIS in Jersey City, New Jersey, which provides communication links, as well
as 24-hour monitoring and engineering support. 
SAVVIS has its own generator and multiple back-up systems in Jersey
City.  We also maintain a second web
hosting facility at AT&T in New York City. 
Our network operations center monitors both web hosting facilities and
is located in our Norwalk, Connecticut headquarters.  All three facilities have an uninterruptible
power supply system, generators and redundant servers.  If SAVVIS


were
unable, for any reason, to support our primary web hosting facility, we would
need to activate our secondary site at AT&T.

We
out-source most of our domestic call center and customer service functions, and
use a real-time interactive voice response system with transfer capabilities to
our call centers and customer service centers.

Intellectual Property

We
currently hold eighteen issued United States patents, Nos. 5,794,207;
5,897,620; 6,085,169; 6,108,639; 6,134,534; 6,240,396; 6,332,129; 6,345,090;
6,356,878; 6,418,415; 6,466,919; 6,484,153; 6,510,418; 6,553,346; 6,993,503;
7,203,660; 7,188,176; 7,333,941 and over twenty pending United States and
foreign patent applications.  All of our
issued United States patents expire between September 4, 2016 and March 22,
2025.  We file additional patent
applications on new inventions, as appropriate.

While
we believe that our issued patents and pending patent applications help to
protect our business, there can be no assurance that:

·

a third party will not have
or obtain one or more patents that can prevent us from practicing features of
our business or that will require us to pay for a license to use those
features;

·

our operations do not or
will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties;

·

any patent can be
successfully defended against challenges by third parties;

·

the pending patent
applications will result in the issuance of patents;

·

competitors or potential
competitors of priceline.com will not devise new methods of competing with us
that are not covered by our patents or patent applications;

·

because of variations in the
application of our business model to each of our services, our patents will be
effective in preventing one or more third parties from utilizing a copycat
business model to offer the same service in one or more categories; or

·

new prior art will not be
discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued patent.

There
has been discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of
so-called “business method” patents. As a result, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office has indicated that it intends to intensify the review process
applicable to such patent applications. The new procedures are not expected to
have a direct

effect on patents already granted. We cannot
anticipate what effect, if any, the new review process will have on our pending
patent applications. See, “

We
aggressively monitor, protect and enforce our copyrights, service marks,
trademarks, trade dress, domain names and trade secrets on an ongoing basis
through a combination of laws and contractual restrictions, such as
confidentiality agreements.  For example,
we endeavor to register our trademarks and service marks in the United States
and internationally, currently holding over one hundred fifty service mark
registrations worldwide.  However,
effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may
not be available in every country in which our services are or may be made
available online, regardless of our continuous efforts to police and register
our marks.  See, “

We
currently own numerous Internet domain names in various top level domains,
particularly for purposes of deterring service mark infringement.  Domain names are generally regulated by
Internet regulatory bodies such as the World Intellectual Property Organization.  The relationship between trademark and unfair
competition laws and domain name registration is evolving.  The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection
Act in the U.S. and the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy of the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers have both significantly
enhanced the ability to deter the infringing incorporation of trademarks into
domain names by third parties and to assert our registrations against
them.  We actively pursue significant
infringers as appropriate, including cybersquatters and typosquatters who
misappropriate our service marks and misspellings thereof as domain names, in
order to maintain our famous marks and prevent the dilution of their
distinctiveness.  See, “

Governmental Regulation

The
services we provide are subject to various federal, state and local
regulations. For example, our travel service is subject to laws governing the
offer and/or sale of travel services as well as laws requiring us to register
as a “seller of travel.”  In addition,
our services may be subject to various state and local taxing regulations.  See “

Risk Factors

—

Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes

”.

In addition, our business is indirectly affected by
regulatory and legal uncertainties affecting travel suppliers and global
distribution systems.  In 2004, the
Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) published a Final Rule, abolishing the
rules governing global distribution systems.  As a part of the Final Rule, the DOT rejected
proposals to regulate online travel service providers’ fare displays.  However, the DOT deferred consideration of a
proposal to amend its policies regarding advertising of air tickets, to require
that agency service fees be stated separately from the price being charged by
the airlines.  Our current service fee
disclosure practices differ from those proposed by the DOT.  If the DOT were to resume consideration of
and adopt the service fee proposal, we may have less flexibility regarding
merchandising air travel on our websites.

We are subject to federal, state and international laws that require
protection of user privacy and user data.  In our processing of travel
transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable
data, both in the United States and Europe. 
This data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in
numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the Commission of the
European Union through its Data Protection Directive and variations of that
directive in the member states of the European Union.  Such government action is typically intended
to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected, processed and transmitted
in or from the governing jurisdiction.

Pricelinemortgage.com is
subject to laws governing the licensing and conduct of persons providing
mortgage brokerage services. Such laws typically require certain consumer
protection disclosures and loan solicitation procedures. For example, the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act prohibits the payment and receipt of mortgage
loan referral fees, and permits persons to be compensated


only
for the fair market value of non-referral services. Accordingly,
pricelinemortgage.com’s home financing service provides non-referral services
such as website development and advertising to a licensed mortgage broker who,
in turn, provides the back-end processing for loan referrals.

All
of our services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and
regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices.

We
are also subject to regulations applicable to businesses conducting online
commerce.  Presently, there are
relatively few laws specifically directed toward online services. However, due
to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and online services, it is
possible that laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet
or online services. These laws and regulations could cover issues such as
online contracts, user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, content
and quality of services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights
and information security. Applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing
issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property
issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is developing, but any
such new legislation could have significant implications on how we conduct
online business. In addition, some states may require us to qualify in that
state to do business as a foreign corporation because our service is available
in that state over the Internet. Although we are qualified to do business in a
number of states, failure to meet the qualifications of certain states, or a
determination that we are required to qualify in additional states, could
subject us to taxes and penalties.  See “

Our
European operations are subject to various foreign regulations and governing
bodies that might limit their services. They may be affected by unexpected
changes in regulatory requirements and various tariffs and trade barriers in
connection with online commerce. Any failure by our European operations to
comply may have an adverse effect on our business.

Seasonality

Our

Name Your Own Price

®

services
are non-refundable in nature, and accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at
the time a booking is generated. 
However, we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel services,
including our international operations, at the time that the customer checks
out of the hotel.  As a result, a
meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as
customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be
recognized until future quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense
the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred,
which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are generated.  Therefore, as our retail hotel business
continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly
impacted by these seasonal factors.

Employees

As of February 15, 2008,
we employed approximately 1,324 full-time employees, of which 282 are based at
our Norwalk, Connecticut headquarters and 998 are based in our international
offices. We also retain independent contractors to support our customer service
and system support functions.

We
have never had a work stoppage and our employees are not represented by
any collective bargaining unit. We consider our relations with our employees to
be good. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to
attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and
managerial personnel, for whom competition is intense.

Item 1A.                Risk
Factors

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered.  The risks and uncertainties described below
are not the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also
impair our business operations.  If any
of the following risks occur, our business, financial

condition, operating results
and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Our

international

operations’
business model exposes us to certain risks that we have not traditionally
experienced in the U.S. hotel business.

Throughout 2007 and 2006,
our international operations
experienced significant growth in their gross bookings.  This growth rate has contributed
significantly to our growth in revenue, gross profit and earnings per
share.  We believe that this growth rate
has also been a significant driver in the increase in our stock price over the
last year.  We expect our international operations to experience a
significant decline in their growth rate in future years as the absolute level
of their gross bookings grows larger. 
Other factors could also cause slowing growth rates in the international business, including changes
in foreign currency exchange rates, travel market conditions, changes in hotel
pricing or availability, the competitiveness of the market and macro economic
weakness.  A decline in our international operations’ growth rate
could have a negative impact on our future revenue and earnings per share
growth rates and, as a consequence, our stock price.

In addition, our

international operations rely heavily on
various third parties to distribute hotel room reservations, and our international operations’ distribution
channels are concentrated among a number of third parties.  Should one or more of such third parties
cease distribution of our international operations’ reservations, or suffer deterioration in
its search engine ranking, due to changes in search engine algorithms or
otherwise, the business of our international operations could be negatively affected.  Similarly, a significant amount of our international business is directed to our
own websites through participation in pay-per-click advertising campaigns on
Internet search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience
rapid change both technically and competitively.  We have experienced increased competition and
increased costs associated with our advertising campaigns.  If a major search engine changes its pricing,
operating or competitive dynamics in a negative manner, our business, results
of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

The strategy of our

international operations involves rapid
expansion into countries in Europe, including eastern Europe, Asia and
elsewhere, many of which have different customs, different levels of customer
acceptance of the Internet and different legislation, regulatory environments
and tax schemes.  Compliance with foreign
legal, regulatory or tax requirements will place demands on our time and
resources, and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse
legal, regulatory or tax consequences. 
If our international operations are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding into other international countries, our business,
results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Our

international operations currently
distribute hotel rooms primarily through a retail model whereby we earn a
commission from the hotel property when the customer checks out of the hotel.  This requires our international operations to pursue
collection of commissions relating to hotel room reservations from the hotel
after the customer has completed his or her stay.  We do not have extensive experience in
collecting commissions from hotels in many of our international markets and
failure to sustain an adequate collection rate could negatively impact the
business of our international operations.


We are dependent on the leisure travel industry and
certain travel suppliers.

Our financial prospects are
significantly dependent upon our sale of leisure travel services.  Leisure travel, including the sale of leisure
airline tickets and hotel rooms, is dependent on personal discretionary spending
levels. As a result, sales of leisure travel services tend to decline during
general economic downturns and recessions. In addition, unforeseen events, such
as terrorist attacks, political instability, regional hostilities, increases in
fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities,
travel related accidents, travel related health concerns and unusual weather
patterns also may adversely affect the leisure travel industry. As a result,
our business also is likely to be affected by those events. Further, work stoppages or
labor unrest at any of the major airlines could materially adversely affect the
airline industry and, as a consequence, have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

During the year ended December 31,
2007,

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights from our five
largest hotel suppliers accounted for approximately 34.9% of total

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights sold, and sales of
airline tickets from our five largest and two largest airline suppliers
accounted for approximately 83.9% and 39.9% of total airline tickets sold,
respectively. As a result, we are currently substantially dependent upon the
continued participation of these suppliers in our system in order to maintain
and continue to grow our total gross profit.

Our arrangements with the
hotel and airline suppliers that participate in our system — either

Name Your Own Price

®

or
price-disclosed service — generally do not require them to provide any specific
quantity of airline tickets or hotel rooms, or to make tickets or rooms
available for any particular route, in any geographic area or at any particular
price.  During the course of our
business, we are in continuous dialogue with our major suppliers about the
nature and extent of their participation in our system. The significant
reduction on the part of any of our major suppliers of their participation in
our system for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

With respect to our hotel
suppliers, increased demand for hotel rooms may reduce the number of hotel
rooms they sell through our service or increase the negotiated rates at which
they are willing to provide availability. 
If hotel occupancy rates improve to the point that our hotel suppliers
no longer place the same value on our distribution systems, such suppliers may
reduce the number of hotel rooms they make available through priceline.com
and/or our

international operations.  Similarly, while not
dependent on certain hotel chains, the growth rates of our international operations are dependent
upon increasing levels of well-priced, demand-based supply from their portfolio
of hotel partners.

Many hotels use merchant
arrangements with companies like ours to dispose of excess hotel rooms at
wholesale rates. If hotels experience increased demand for rooms, they might
reduce the number of rooms they make available through our merchant price-disclosed
hotel service.  The recent improvement in
occupancy rates discussed above could cause hotels to reduce the number of
hotel rooms they make available through our merchant price-disclosed hotel
service.

In addition, certain hotels
have begun initiatives to reduce margins received by third party intermediaries
on retail merchant transactions, which is the primary method we employ to
distribute retail hotel room reservations in the United States.  Many hotels distribute rooms through their
own websites and therefore might increase negotiated rates for merchant rate
hotel rooms sold through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service, decreasing
the margin available to us.  While our
merchant price-disclosed hotel agreements with our leading hotel suppliers
provide for specified discounts, if one or more participating hotels were to
require us to limit our merchant margins, upon contract renewal or otherwise,
it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.


With respect to our airline
suppliers, the airline industry has experienced a shift in market share from
full-service carriers to low-cost carriers that focus primarily on discount
fares to leisure destinations and we expect this trend to continue.  Some low-cost carriers, such as Southwest,
have not historically distributed their tickets through us or other third-party
intermediaries.  In addition, certain
airlines have significantly limited or eliminated sales of airline tickets
through opaque channels, preferring to consistently show the lowest available
price on their own website.  Certain
airlines have also reduced their domestic capacity, which could reduce the
number of airline tickets available to our customers.  If one or more participating airlines were to
further limit or eliminate discounting through opaque channels and/or further
reduce capacity, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Due to our dependence on
the airline industry, we could be severely affected by changes in that
industry, and, in many cases, we will have no control over such changes or
their timing.  Recent, there has been a
great deal of speculation in the travel industry, as well as the national
media, about potential mergers among major domestic airlines.  If one of our major airline suppliers merges
or consolidates with, or is acquired by, another company that either does not
participate in the priceline.com system or that participates on substantially
lower levels, the surviving company may elect not to participate in our system
or to participate at lower levels than the previous supplier.  For example, in September 2005, US
Airways and America West merged.  US
Airways was a meaningful participant in our

Name
Your Own Price

®

system, but America West participated on a
very limited basis.  The resulting entity
participates in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system, but at much lower levels
than US Airways’ historical participation.

In addition, in the event
that one of our major suppliers voluntarily or involuntarily declares
bankruptcy and is subsequently unable to successfully emerge from bankruptcy,
and we are unable to replace such supplier, our business would be adversely
affected.  To the extent other major U.S.
airlines that participate in our system declare bankruptcy, they may be unable
or unwilling to honor tickets sold for their flights. Our policy in such event
would be to direct customers seeking a refund or exchange to the airline, and
not to provide a remedy ourselves. Because we are the merchant-of-record on
sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets to our customers,
however, we could experience a significant increase in demands for refunds or
credit card charge backs from customers, which could materially and adversely
affect our operations and financial results. In addition, because

Name Your Own Price

®

customers do not choose the airlines
on which they are to fly, the bankruptcy of a major U.S. airline or even the
possibility of a major U.S. airline declaring bankruptcy could discourage
customers from using our

Name Your Own Price

®

system to book airline tickets.

The loss of any major
airline participant in our

Name Your Own
Price

®

system could result in other major airlines
electing to terminate their participation in the

Name Your Own Price

®

system, which would further negatively impact
our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, fewer independent suppliers
reduces opacity and competition among suppliers.  In such event, if we are unable to divert
sales to other suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial
condition may be adversely affected.

In addition, given the
concentration of the airline industry, particularly in the domestic market, our
competitors could exert pressure on other airlines not to supply us with
tickets. Moreover, the airlines may attempt to establish their own buyer driven
commerce service or participate or invest in other similar services.

With respect to our rental car suppliers, increased utilization (a common metric that
measures rental car customer usage) may reduce the number of car reservations
they sell through our service or increase the negotiated rates at which they are
willing to provide car reservations. 
Like airline and hotel suppliers, rental car companies are focused on
selling rental car reservations through their own sites, which reduces the
amount of rental car reservations available to us.  Furthermore, if one of our major rental car
suppliers merges or consolidates with, or is acquired by, another company that
either does not participate in the priceline.com system or that participates on
substantially lower levels, the surviving


company may elect not to participate in our system or
to participate at lower levels than the previous supplier.  Finally, because rental car days are
typically less expensive than airline tickets or hotel room nights, a reduction
in retail rental car rates has a disproportionately adverse effect on sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car days since customers may
be less likely to accept the trade-offs associated with that service.

Intense competition could reduce our market share
and harm our financial performance.

We compete with both online
and traditional sellers of the services we offer. The market for the services
we offer is intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch
new sites at a relatively low cost. In addition, the major online travel
companies with which we compete have significantly greater financial resources
and capital than we do.  We may not be
able to effectively compete with industry conglomerates such as Orbitz
Worldwide, Sabre or Expedia, each of which have access to significantly greater
and more diversified resources than we do.

We currently or potentially
compete with a variety of companies with respect to each service we offer. With
respect to our travel services, these competitors include, but are not limited
to:

·

Internet travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, which are
owned by Expedia; Travelocity and lastminute.com, which are owned by the Sabre
Group; Orbitz.com, Cheaptickets, ebookers, HotelClub and RatesToGo, which are
currently owned by Orbitz Worldwide; laterooms and asiarooms owned by Tui
Travel, and Gullivers, octopustravel, Superbreak, Venere, hotel.de, Hotel
Reservation Service and Wotif;

·

travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel companies and rental car
companies, many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive
business;

·

large online portal and search companies, such as AOL (including AOL
Travel), Yahoo! (including Yahoo! Travel) and Google;

·

traditional travel agencies;

·

online travel search sites such as Mobissimo.com, FareChase.com, Kayak.com
and Kayak.com’s recent acquisition, SideStep.com (each sometimes referred to as
“meta-search”) and travel research sites that have search functionality, such
as TripAdvisor, Travelzoo and Cheapflights.com; and

·

operators of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo,
Worldspan, L.P., Amadeus and Sabre.

Many airline, hotel and
rental car suppliers, including suppliers with which we conduct business, are
focusing on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party
distributors such as us.  Certain
suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book
airline reservations through an online channel other than their own website.  Furthermore, several low cost airlines, which
are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their tickets
exclusively through their own websites. 
Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a
processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as bonus miles or
loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers
than models like ours.

We potentially face
competition from a number of large Internet companies and services that have
expertise in developing online commerce and in facilitating Internet traffic,
including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and Yahoo!, which compete with us
either directly or indirectly through affiliations with other e-commerce or
off-line companies.  We also compete with
“meta-search” companies, which are companies that leverage their search
technology to aggregate travel search results


across supplier, travel agent and other
websites.  For example, Yahoo! owns
FareChase.com, a travel search-engine that searches for fares and hotel rates
at travel supplier and third-party websites, and refers traffic to those sites,
and AOL is party to a marketing and technology agreement, and holds a minority
interest in, Kayak.com, another leading meta-search company.  Other established search engine companies as
well as start-ups are attempting to enter the online travel marketplace in this
manner.  If Yahoo!, Google or other
portals decide to refer significant traffic to travel search engines, it could
result in more competition from supplier websites and higher customer
acquisition costs for third-party sites such as ours. In addition, because we
advertise on certain meta-search sites, a loss of business for competitive
reasons could result.  Competition from these
and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Many of our current and
potential competitors, including Internet directories, search engines and large
traditional retailers, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases,
greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing,
personnel, technical and other resources than priceline.com. Some of these
competitors may be able to secure services on more favorable terms than we can.
In addition, many of these competitors may be able to devote significantly
greater resources to:

·

marketing and promotional campaigns;

·

attracting traffic to their websites;

·

attracting and retaining key employees;

·

securing vendors and supply; and

·

website and systems development.

Increased competition could
result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and damage to our
brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully
against current and future competitors or that competition will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Our business could be negatively affected by
changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics.

We utilize Internet search
engines, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to
generate traffic to our websites.  Our

international operations, in particular,
rely to a significant extent upon business from search engines such as
Google.  Search engines such as Google
frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and
display of results of a user’s search, such that the placement of links to our
sites, and particularly those of our international operations and their affiliates, can be negatively
affected.  In a similar way, a
significant amount of our international business is directed to our own websites through
participation in pay-per-click advertising campaigns on Internet search engines
whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change commercially,
technically and competitively.  If a
major search engine, such as Google, changes its algorithms in a manner that
negatively affects the search engine ranking of our brands or our third-party
distribution partners or changes its pricing, operating or competitive dynamics
in a negative manner, our business, results of operations and financial
condition would be adversely affected.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates.

As a result of our acquisitions
of our

international operations, we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our
business outside the United States and are reporting our results in U.S.
dollars.  As a result, we face exposure
to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our
international
operations are
translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation.  For example, our international operations contributed approximately $372.6 million to
our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, which compares to
$182.7 million for the same period in 2006. Approximately $30.3 million of this
increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  If the U.S.
dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these
foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net
revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss.  Similarly,


our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and
net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local
currency. Additionally, transactions denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency may result in gains and losses that may adversely impact
our results of operations.

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash to meet future debt,
purchase of minority interest and earnout obligations.

As
of December 31, 2007, we have $570 million of convertible senior notes
outstanding. Based upon the closing price of our common stock during the
measurement periods provided for by our convertible debt during the three
months ended December 31, 2007, the contingent conversion thresholds for
each of the notes were exceeded.  As a
result, all of our outstanding notes are convertible at the option of the
holder as of December 31, 2007, and, accordingly, have been classified as
a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date.  While many factors contribute to the
likelihood that the holders of the notes will elect to convert all or a portion
of the notes, as the price of our common stock increases, the likelihood of
conversion also increases.  If holders
elect to convert, we would be required to settle the principal amount of the
notes in cash and the conversion premium in cash or shares of common stock.

In
connection with our acquisitions of Booking.com B.V. in July 2005 and
Booking.com Limited in September 2004 and the reorganization of our
international operations, key managers of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com
Limited purchased shares of priceline.com International.  The holders of the minority interest in
priceline.com International have the right to put their shares to us in
2008 at a purchase price reflecting the fair market value of the shares at the
time of the exercise of the put right (see Note 15 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements).  The estimated
aggregate fair value of the minority interest in priceline.com International
subject to put rights is estimated to be approximately $95 million at December 31,
2007, including unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units.

Pursuant
to the purchase agreement relating to our acquisition of the Agoda Companies, we may be required to pay, in 2011,
certain shareholders of the Agoda
Companies an earnout of up to $141.6 million in cash if the Agoda Companies achieve certain performance targets
from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010.

We
would likely fund these obligations with existing cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, common
stock issuances and/or additional borrowings. 
It is possible that we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to
arrange for additional financing which would cause us to be in default under
our indentures or revolving credit facility and/or in breach of purchase
agreement obligations relating to priceline.com International or the Agoda Companies, and our business, results of
operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

The repayment of our $570 million Convertible Senior Notes could result
in a substantial decrease in our net interest income.

We
incur interest expense with respect to our convertible senior notes at annual
percentage rates that range between 0.50% and 2.25%.  Because we currently maintain and have
maintained significant cash and cash equivalents, short-term investment and
long-term investment balances on our balance sheet (approximately $510.3
million as of December 31, 2007) and because the interest rates that we
earn on those balances are significantly in excess of the interest rates that
we pay on our convertible senior notes, we are generating significant interest
income net of our interest expense.  If
we were to use our cash and investment balances to repay our convertible senior
notes, or if we are unable to refinance our convertible senior notes with new
indebtedness bearing interest at rates similar to our convertible senior notes,
then our earnings could be significantly negatively impacted by a decrease in
net interest income.  While many factors
contribute to the likelihood that the holders of the notes will elect to
convert all or a portion of the notes, as the price of our common stock
increases, the likelihood of conversion also increases.


Our processing, storage, use and disclosure
of personal data exposes us to risks of internal or external security breaches
and could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation,
conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.

The secure transmission of
confidential information over the Internet is essential in maintaining consumer
and supplier confidence in the priceline.com services. Substantial or ongoing
security breaches whether instigated internally or externally on our system or
other Internet based systems could significantly harm our business. We
currently require customers who use certain of our services to guarantee their
offers with their credit card, either online or, in some instances, through our
toll-free telephone service. It is possible that advances in computer
circumvention capabilities, new discoveries or other developments, including
our own acts or omissions, could result in a compromise or breach of customer
transaction data.

We incur substantial
expense to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences.
However, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security
breaches. A party (whether internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third
party) that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal customer
information or transaction data, proprietary information or cause significant
interruptions in our operations. For instance, several major websites,
including websites operated by us, have experienced interruptions, which could
be significant, as a result of improper direction of excessive traffic to those
sites, and computer viruses have substantially disrupted e-mail and other
functionality in a number of countries, including the United States. Security
breaches also could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose
us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to
regulatory penalties. Security breaches could also cause customers and
potential customers to lose confidence in our security, which would have a
negative effect on the value of our brand. 
Our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be
adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.

Companies that we have
acquired, such as our international operations, and that we may acquire in the
future, may employ security and networking standards at levels we find
unsatisfactory.  The process of enhancing
infrastructure to attain improved security and network standards may be time
consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are
difficult to obtain.  Such acquisitions
increase the number of potential vulnerabilities, and can cause delays in
detection of an attack, as well as the timelines of recovery from any given
attack. Failure to raise any such standards that we find unsatisfactory could
expose us to security breaches of, among other things, personal customer data
and credit card information that would have an adverse impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

We also face risks
associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business
over the Internet. Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy
on the Internet, and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth
of the Internet and, therefore, the priceline.com service as a means of
conducting commercial transactions. 
Additionally, security breaches at the third-party, supplier or
distributor systems upon which we rely could result in negative publicity,
damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible
liability and subject us to regulatory penalties.

In our processing of travel
transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable
data.  This data is increasingly subject
to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world,
including the Commission of the European Union through its Data Protection
Directive and variations of that directive in the member states of the European
Union.  This government action is
typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected,
processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.  We could be adversely affected if legislation
or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if
governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their


legislation or regulations in ways that negatively
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United
States, government agencies have been contemplating or developing initiatives
to enhance national and aviation security, such as the Transportation Security
Administration’s Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System, known as
CAPPS II.  These initiatives may result
in conflicting legal requirements with respect to data handling.  As privacy and data protection has become a
more sensitive issue, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a
result of differing views on the privacy of travel data.  Travel businesses have also been subjected to
investigations, lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper
disclosure of passenger information. 
These and other privacy developments that are difficult to anticipate
could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We rely
on the performance of highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain
or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our
business would be harmed.

Our

performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing
ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled
personnel for all areas of our organization. 
In particular, the contributions of certain key senior management in the
U.S. and Europe are critical to the overall management of the company.  In addition, because the value of company
equity grants and, in the case of our European senior management, their
minority ownership interest, which is subject to repurchase in March and August of
2008, has increased substantially as our share price has increased, it may
become more difficult to retain senior managers over time as they realize the
value of these equity interests.  We
cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our
senior management or other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our
business.

In
addition, competition for well-qualified employees in all aspects of our
business, including software engineers and other technology professionals, is
intense both in the U.S. and abroad. 
With the recent success of our international business and the increased
profile of the Booking.com business and brand, competitors have increased their
efforts to hire our international employees. 
Further, as we continue to grow our international operations, we are
seeking to rapidly hire a wide range of employees in different — and often
constrained — job markets.  Our continued
ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees
and to retain and motivate existing employees. 
If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining
and motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected. We
do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.

Our
expansion places a significant strain on our management, technical, operational
and financial resources.

We
have rapidly and significantly expanded our international operations and
anticipate expanding further to pursue growth of our service offerings and
customer base. For example, the number of our employees worldwide has grown
from less than 700 in the first quarter of 2007, to approximately 1,324 as of February 15,
2008, which growth is almost entirely comprised of hires by our international
operations .  Such expansion increases
the complexity of our business and places a significant strain on our
management, operations, technical performance, financial resources and internal
financial control and reporting functions.

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion
effectively.  Our current and planned
personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and
effectively manage our future operations, especially as we employ personnel in
multiple geographic locations.  We may
not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel,
which may limit our growth, damage our reputation, negatively affect our
financial performance, and harm our business.


Capacity constraints and system failures could harm
our business.

We rely on certain third
party computer systems and third party service providers, including the
computerized central reservation systems of the airline, hotel and rental car
industries to satisfy demand for airline tickets and domestic hotel room and
rental car reservations. In particular, our domestic travel business is
substantially dependent upon the computerized reservation systems of operators
of global distribution systems for the travel industry. Any interruption in
these third party services systems or deterioration in their performance could
prevent us from booking airline, hotel and rental car reservations and have a
material adverse effect on our business. Our agreements with some third party
service providers are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide
recourse for service interruptions. In the event our arrangement with any of
such third parties is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative
source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms
and, as a result, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

We also depend upon
Paymentech to process our U.S. credit card transactions. If Paymentech were
wholly or partially compromised, our cash flows could be disrupted until such a
time as a replacement process could be put in place with a different
vendor.  As we add complexity to our
systems infrastructure by adding new suppliers and distribution, our total
system availability could decline and our results could suffer.

A substantial amount of our
computer hardware for operating our services is currently located at the
facilities of SAVVIS in New Jersey, AT&T in New York City, Equinix Europe Ltd.
in London, England, Global Switch Amsterdam B.V. and TelecityRedbus in the
Netherlands. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from human error, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication
failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage,
intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite any precautions
we may take, the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such
misconduct, a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the SAVVIS
facility, the AT&T facility, the Equinix Europe Ltd. facility or the
TelecityRedbus and Global Switch Amsterdam B.V. facility could result in
lengthy interruptions in our services. In addition, the failure by SAVVIS,
Verizon, AT&T, Equinix Europe Ltd., Colt Telecom Group Limited, Verizon
Business B.V., or TrueServer B.V. to provide our required data communications
capacity could result in interruptions in our service. Any system failure that
causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our
services could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Like many online
businesses, we have experienced system failures from time to time. In addition
to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a
significant amount of user questions and complaints that need to be addressed
by our customer support personnel. Any unscheduled interruption in our service
could result in an immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial and may
cause some users to switch to our competitors. If we experience frequent or
persistent system failures, our reputation and brand could be permanently
harmed. We have been taking steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of
our system. These steps are expensive, may reduce our margins and may not be
successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.

We use both internally
developed systems and third-party systems to operate the priceline.com service,
including transaction processing, order management and financial systems. If
the number of users of our services increases substantially, or if critical
third-party systems stop operating as designed, we will need to significantly
expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems, financial
and accounting systems and other infrastructure. We do not know whether we will
be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions
in a timely manner, and, depending on the third-party systems affected, our
transactional, financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a
meaningful amount of time before repair.


If our systems cannot be
expanded to cope with increased demand or fails to perform, we could
experience:

·

unanticipated disruptions in service;

·

slower response times;

·

decreased customer service and customer satisfaction; or

·

delays in the introduction of new services,

any of which could impair our reputation, damage our
brands and materially and adversely affect our revenues.  While we do maintain redundant systems and
hosting services for some of our business, it is possible that we could
experience an interruption in our business, and we do not carry business
interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.

Companies that we have
acquired, such as our international operations, and that we may acquire in the
future, may present known or unknown capacity/stability or other types of
system challenges.  The process of enhancing
infrastructure to attain improved capacity/scalability and other system
characteristics may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources
and expertise that are difficult to obtain. 
Such acquisitions increase potential downtime, customer facing problems
and compliance problems.  Failure to
successfully make any such improvements to such infrastructures could expose us
to potential capacity, stability, and system problems that would have an
adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We have integrated the
majority of our international agency hotel
offerings into a single back-office extranet system operated by Booking.com
B.V., in order to allow customers of both Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com
Limited to access hotels which may have previously been available only through
either Booking.com B.V. or Booking.com Limited. 
Because all of our

international

operations’ agency hotel offerings are therefore on one platform, in
the event that the extranet operated by Booking.com B.V. experiences a system
failure, our international operations
could be unable to generate hotel bookings, which would have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes.

On
an ongoing basis, we conduct a review and interpretation of the tax laws in
various states and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state and
local hotel occupancy and other related taxes. 
In connection with our review, we have met and had discussions with
taxing authorities in certain jurisdictions but the ultimate resolution in any
particular jurisdiction cannot be determined at this time.  Currently, hotels collect and remit hotel
occupancy and related taxes to the various tax authorities based on the amounts
collected by the hotels.  Consistent with
this practice, we collect a tax recovery charge on the underlying cost of the
hotel room night from customers and are billed by the hotel operators for taxes
the hotel operators pay to the appropriate tax authorities.  As discussed above, several jurisdictions
have initiated lawsuits indicating the position that sales tax or hotel
occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by a
customer for our service and the amount charged by the hotel for the underlying
room.  Historically, we have not
collected taxes on this differential. 
Additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are
subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek
to collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively or both.  Such actions may result in substantial
liabilities for past and/or future sales and could have a material adverse
effect our business and results of operations. 
To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that any such
tax collection responsibility exists, it is likely that, with respect to future
transactions, we would collect any such additional tax obligation from our
customers, which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room
reservations to our customers and, consequently, could reduce hotel reservation
transactions.  We will continue to assess
the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to
the extent appropriate, we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.


Current economic conditions in the United States are triggering active
consideration on ways to generate additional tax revenues by the federal, state
and local governments. We cannot predict what changes in tax law or
interpretations of such laws may be adopted or assure that such changes or
interpretations would not materially impact our business.

Acquisitions could result in operating
difficulties.

As part of our business
strategy, in September 2004, we acquired Booking.com Limited, in July 2005,
Booking.com B.V. and, in November 2007, the Agoda Companies.  We may enter into additional business
combinations and acquisitions in the future. 
Acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, use
of our cash resources, incurrence of debt and amortization of expenses related
to intangible assets acquired.  In
addition, the process of integrating an acquired company, business or
technology may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.  The acquisitions of

Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited, and the Agoda Companies were accompanied by a number of
risks, including, without limitation:

·

the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and
policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the
acquisitions may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies;

·

the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of

Booking.com
Limited, which are principally located in
Cambridge, England, Booking.com B.V., which are principally located in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the Agoda Companies, which are principally
located in Singapore and Bangkok, Thailand, with and into our operations, which
are headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut;

·

the potential disruption of our ongoing business and
distraction of management;

·

the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and
rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such
integration;

·

the failure to further successfully develop acquired
technology resulting in the impairment of amounts currently capitalized as
intangible assets;

·

the impairment of relationships with customers of

Booking.com
B.V., Booking.com Limited and the Agoda
Companies or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations;

·

the impairment of relationships with employees of
Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited and the Agoda Companies or our own
business as a result of any integration of new management personnel;

·

the potential unknown liabilities associated with
Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited and the Agoda Companies.

We may experience similar
risks in connection with any future acquisitions. We may not be successful in
addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the
acquisitions of

Booking.com
B.V., Booking.com Limited or the Agoda
Companies, or that we could encounter in future acquisitions, which would harm
our business or cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our
acquisitions.  As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $434 million assigned
primarily to the intangible assets and goodwill of Booking.com B.V.,
Booking.com Limited and the Agoda Companies,
and therefore, the occurrence of any of the aforementioned risks could result
in a material adverse impact, including an impairment of these assets, which
could cause us to have to record a charge for impairment.  Any such charge could adversely impact our
operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline significantly.


We may not be able to keep up with rapid
technological and other changes.

The markets in which we
compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry
standards, consolidation, frequent new service announcements, introductions and
enhancements and changing consumer demands. We may not be able to keep up with
these rapid changes. In addition, these market characteristics are heightened
by the emerging nature of the Internet and the apparent need of companies from
many industries to offer Internet based services. As a result, our future
success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies,
to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and to continually improve
the performance, features and reliability of our service in response to
competitive service offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace. In
addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or
telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us
to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or
infrastructure.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) is considering
accounting rule changes that would significantly impact the accounting for
our convertible debt.

During the third quarter 2007, FASB issued for comment a
proposed FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-a, “Accounting for Convertible
Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including
Partial Cash Settlement)” (“FSP APB 14-a”) that would significantly impact the
accounting for convertible debt.  The FSP
would require cash settled convertible debt, such as our $570 million aggregate
principal amount of convertible senior notes that are currently outstanding, to
be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be
assigned to each.  The value assigned to
the debt component would be the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date,
of a similar bond without the conversion feature.  The difference between the bond cash proceeds
and this estimated fair value would be recorded as a debt discount and
amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond.  Although FSP APB 14-a would have no impact on
our actual past or future cash flows, it would require us to record a
significant amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is
amortized.  As a result, there would be a
material adverse impact on our results of operations and earnings per
share.  In addition, if our convertible
debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity, any unamortized debt discount
would result in a loss on extinguishment. 
FASB is expected to begin its redeliberations of the guidance in the
proposed FSP in February 2008.

FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) is reviewing
Issue No. 07-5, “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature)
Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock.” This Issue addresses the determination of
whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own
stock.  Under current US GAAP, the conversion options embedded in our
convertible debt are considered to be indexed to our stock.  If certain of the views being discussed by
the EITF are adopted, we may be required to account for our embedded conversion
options as derivatives and record them on our balance sheet as a liability with
subsequent fair value changes recorded in the income statement.  Although EITF 07-5 would have no impact on
our actual past or future cash flows, it would require us to record a
significant liability on our consolidated balance sheet.  Subsequent fair value adjustments could
result in significant charges or credits recorded in our consolidated statement
of operations.  As a result, there would
be a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of
operations and earnings per share.  The
EITF is expected to continue discussing EITF 07-5 at future meetings

.

We rely on the value of the priceline.com and
Booking.com brands, along with others, and the costs of maintaining and
enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.

We believe that maintaining
and expanding the priceline.com brand, and other owned brands, including

Booking.com,
Active Hotels, Agoda, Lowestfare.com, Rentalcars.com, Breezenet.com, MyTravelGuide.com
and Travelweb, are important aspects of our efforts to attract and expand our
user and advertiser base.  As our larger
competitors spend increasingly more on advertising, we are required to spend
more in order to maintain our brand recognition.  In addition, we have spent considerable money
and resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of the priceline.com
brands, and we will


continue to spend money on, and devote resources to
advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance
consumer awareness of the priceline.com brands. We may not be able to
successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of the priceline.com
brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts
may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance customer
awareness of the priceline.com brands in a cost-effective manner, our business,
results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Our outstanding convertible senior notes
could result in substantial shareholder dilution.

Our convertible senior
notes are convertible into shares of our common stock if certain specified
conditions are met.  All of our
convertible notes are currently convertible. 
Upon conversion, the holder will receive cash for the principal amount
of the note and cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and
shares of our common stock for the conversion value in excess of such principal
amount.  If our stock trades above the
conversion prices of the outstanding convertible notes, our diluted share count
will increase by the net number of shares that would become issuable to the
holders of our outstanding convertible notes and, as a consequence, have a
dilutive impact on net income per share. 
As an example, at stock prices of $40 per share, $80 per share, $100 per
share and $150 per share, our diluted share count would include approximately
0.1 million, 7.2 million, 8.6 million and 10.5 million equivalent shares,
respectively, related to the conversion premium on our convertible debt
(excluding the offsetting impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges described in
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The

Conversion Spread Hedges increase the effective conversion price of the
2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes from $40.38 to $50.47 per share, and reduce the
dilution upon conversion of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes.  Since the impact of the Conversion Spread
Hedges is anti-dilutive it is excluded from the calculation of net income per
share under GAAP until they are exercised upon maturity.

Our financial results will
be materially impacted by payment of cash income taxes in the future.

We commenced recording a U.S. tax
provision in the third quarter of 2005 upon reversing of a portion of our
valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. 
Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not
expect to pay cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income tax for the foreseeable
future.  We expect to make cash payments
for U.S. alternative minimum tax and for certain international taxes.  We expect that in 2008 and beyond, our
international operations will grow their pretax income at higher rates than the
U.S and therefore it is our expectation that our cash tax rate and cash tax
payments will increase as our international business generates an increasing
share of our pretax income.

The unit profitability of our airline ticket business has declined and
could continue to decline, as we may be subject to, among other things,
competitive pressure and loss or reduction of global distribution system fees.

In
recent quarters, the amount of profit we make per airline ticket sold has
declined and could continue to decline as we, among other things, experience
pressure from suppliers to reduce our profit, strive to remain competitive with
other online travel agencies and continue to be subject to reduction of global
distribution system, or GDS, fees paid to us. 
Historically, we have relied on fees paid to us by GDSs for travel bookings made through GDSs for a portion
of our gross profit and a substantial portion of our operating income. We
rebate certain GDS costs to certain suppliers (e.g., airlines, hotels, etc.) in
exchange for contractual considerations such as those relating to pricing and
availability, and expect to continue to do so in the future.  During 2006, most agreements between GDSs and
the major domestic airlines expired, and most airlines have negotiated new
agreements with reduced distribution costs for the airlines that went into
effect on or around September 1, 2006. 
The structure of these new agreements, along with airline pressure on us
to operate under the new structures, requires us to reduce our aggregate compensation
and book through lower cost channels to receive airlines’ full content and
avoid airline service fees.  We have
entered into new agreements with a number of airlines to obtain access to
airline content, and are in continuing discussions with others to obtain
similar access.  If we were denied access


to airlines’ full content or had to impose service
fees on our airline tickets, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, some travel
suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to
develop technology to bypass the traditional GDSs, such as enabling direct
connections to the travel suppliers or using alternative global distribution
methods recently developed by new entrants to the global distribution
marketplace, such as G2 Switchworks Corp. 
Such new entrants propose using technology that is less complex than
traditional global distribution systems, and that enables the distribution of
airline tickets in a manner that is more cost-effective to the airline
suppliers.  To this end, in 2006, we
entered into an agreement with G2 Switchworks for the provision of GDS
services.  In addition, to further reduce
our dependence on Worldspan, L.P., in 2006, we entered into an agreement for
the provision of GDS services with Sabre Inc. 
Development of the technology to connect to such alternative GDSs, or to
enable direct connections to travel suppliers, requires the use of information
technology resources and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses,
increase the frequency/duration of system problems and delay other projects.

We face risks related to our intellectual property.

We regard our intellectual
property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and
patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license
agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our
proprietary rights. If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual
property, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

While we believe that our
issued patents and pending patent applications help to protect our business,
there can be no assurance that:

·

any patent can be successfully defended against challenges
by third parties;

·

pending patent applications will result in the issuance of
patents;

·

competitors or potential competitors of priceline.com will
not devise new methods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents
or patent applications;

·

because of variations in the application of our business
model to each of our services, our patents will be effective in preventing one
or more third parties from utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same
service in one or more categories;

·

new prior art will not be discovered which may diminish the
value of or invalidate an issued patent;

·

a third party will not have or obtain one or more patents
that prevent us from practicing features of our business or require us to pay
for a license to use those features; or

·

our operations do not or will not infringe valid,
enforceable patents of third parties.

There has been recent
discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of so called “business
method” patents. As a result, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has
indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable to such
patent applications. The new procedures are not expected to have a direct
effect on patents already granted. We cannot anticipate what effect, if any,
the new review process will have on our pending patent applications.

In addition, there has been recent
discussion in various federal court proceedings regarding the patentability and
validity of so called “business method” patents. The Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit, in a recent order in

In re Bilski

, has questioned whether it
should review its earlier decision affirming the patentability of so-called
business method patents in

State Street Bank v. Signature Financial

.  
We cannot anticipate what effect, if any, any new federal court decision will
have on our issued patents or pending patent applications.

We pursue the registration
of our trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. However,
effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may
not be available in every country in which our services are made available
online. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future,
certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material,
to third parties. These licensees may take actions that might diminish the
value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.


From time to time, in the
ordinary course of our business, we have been subject to, and are currently
subject to, legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property
rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert
intellectual property claims, in particular patent claims, against us,
particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business.  We endeavor to defend our intellectual
property rights diligently, but intellectual property litigation is extremely
expensive and time consuming, and has and is likely to continue to divert
managerial attention and resources from our business objectives.  Successful infringement claims against us
could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from operating our
business, or portions of our business. 
In addition, resolution of claims may require us to obtain licenses to
use intellectual property rights belonging to third parties, which may be expensive
to procure, or possibly to cease using those rights altogether.  Any of these events could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our business is
exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud and charge backs.

To date, our results have
been negatively impacted by purchases made using fraudulent credit cards.
Because we act as the merchant-of-record in a majority of our transactions, we
may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well
as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are held liable
for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do
not act as merchant of record. 
Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting
credit card charge backs.  If we are
unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our website, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

Fluctuations in our
financial results make quarterly comparisons and financial forecasting
difficult.

Our
revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to
quarter because our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, which reflect
seasonal trends for the travel services offered by our websites. Traditional
leisure travel bookings in the United States are higher in the second and third
calendar quarters of the year as consumers take spring and summer vacations. In
the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year, demand for travel services
in the United States generally declines and the number of bookings
flattens.  Travel revenues in Europe, on
the other hand, have been higher in the third and fourth quarters than in the
first and second quarters.  Furthermore,
prior to introducing a retail travel option to our customers, substantially all
of our business was conducted under the

Name
Your Own Price

®

system and accordingly, because those
services are non-refundable in nature, we recognize travel revenue at the time
a booking was generated.  We recognize
revenue generated from our retail hotel service, however, including our

international
operations, at
the time that the customer checks out of the hotel.  As a result, we have seen and expect to
continue to see, that a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated
earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer
vacations, will not be recognized until future quarters.  This could result in a disproportionate
amount of our annual earnings being recognized in later quarters.

Our results may also be
affected by seasonal fluctuations in the supply made available to us by
airlines, hotels and rental car suppliers. Our revenues and operating results
may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of these
factors. As a result, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and
operating results may not be meaningful. In addition, due to our limited
operating history, a relatively new and unproven business model and an
uncertain environment in the travel industry, it may be difficult to predict
our future revenues or results of operations.

Because of these
fluctuations and uncertainties, our operating results may fail to meet the
expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this happens, the trading
price of our common stock would almost certainly be materially adversely
affected.


Our stock price is highly volatile

.

The market price of our common
stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are
beyond our control:

·

quarterly variations in our operating results;

·

operating results that vary from the expectations of
securities analysts and investors;

·

changes in expectations as to our future financial
performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and
investors;

·

changes in our capital structure;

·

changes in market valuations of other Internet or online
service companies;

·

announcements of technological innovations or new services
by us or our competitors;

·

announcements by us or our competitors of significant
contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
commitments;

·

loss of a major supplier participant, such as an airline or
hotel chain;

·

changes in the status of our intellectual property rights;

·

lack of success in the expansion of our business model
geographically;

·

announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings
against us or adverse developments in pending proceedings;

·

occurrences of a significant security breach;

·

additions or departures of key personnel; and

·

stock market price and volume fluctuations.

Sales of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of
our common stock by introducing a large number of sellers to the market. Given
the volatility that exists for our shares, such sales could cause the market
price of our common stock to decline significantly. In addition, fluctuations
in our stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock
attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds
into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either
direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis.

The trading prices of
Internet company stocks in general, including ours, have experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations. To the extent that the public’s perception of
the prospects of Internet or e-commerce companies is negative, our stock price
could decline further, regardless of our results. Other broad market and
industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless
of our operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political
and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate
fluctuations, also may decrease the market price of our common stock.  Negative market conditions could adversely
affect our ability to raise additional capital.

We are defendants in
securities class action litigations. In the past, securities class action
litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of
volatility in the market price of its securities. To the extent our stock price
declines or is volatile, we may in the future be the target of additional
litigation. This additional litigation could result in substantial costs and
divert management’s attention and resources.


We are party to legal
proceedings which, if adversely decided, could materially adversely affect us.

We are a party to the legal
proceedings described in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The defense of the actions described in Note
17 may increase our expenses and an adverse outcome in any of such actions
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Regulatory and legal
uncertainties could harm our business.

The services we offer through the
priceline.com service are regulated by federal and state governments. Our
ability to provide such services is and will continue to be affected by such
regulations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable
interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could
require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the
affected markets to become impractical and otherwise have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  See “Uncertainty
regarding state and local taxes.”

Litigation Related to Hotel Occupancy and Other Taxes

Statewide Putative Class Actions

A number of cities and counties have filed putative
class actions on behalf of themselves and other allegedly similarly situated
cities and counties within the same respective state against the Company and
other defendants, including, but not in all cases, Lowestfare.com Incorporated
and Travelweb LLC, both of which are subsidiaries of the Company, and
Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotels.com GP, LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets, Inc.;
Travelport, Inc. (f/k/a Cendant Travel Distribution Services Group, Inc.);
Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a Lodging.com);
Maupintour Holding LLC; Orbitz, Inc.; Orbitz, LLC; Site59.com, LLC;
Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com LP; and Travelnow.com, Inc.  Each complaint alleges, among other things,
that the defendants violated each jurisdiction’s respective hotel occupancy tax
ordinance with respect to the charges and remittance of amounts to cover taxes
under each ordinance.  Each complaint
typically seeks compensatory damages, disgorgement, penalties available by law,
attorneys’ fees and other relief.  Such
actions include:


City of Los Angeles v.
Hotels.com, Inc., et al.

:  On December 30,
2004, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the
County of Los Angeles by the City of Los Angeles on behalf of itself and an
alleged class of California cities, counties and other municipalities that have
enacted occupancy taxes.  In addition to
the tax claims, the complaint also asserts unfair competition claims under
California Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq. (“Section 17200”).  On August 31, 2005, the City of Los
Angeles filed an amended complaint adding a claim for a declaratory
judgment.  On September 26, 2005,
the court sustained the defendants’ demurrers on grounds of improper joinder of
defendants and claims, and therefore, dismissed the amended complaint, with
leave to file a second amended complaint. 
On February 8, 2006, the City of Los Angeles filed a second amended
complaint that asserts the same claims but includes additional allegations of
fact.  On March 27, 2006, at the
direction of the court, the defendants filed renewed demurrers to the second
amended complaint on grounds of improper joinder of defendants and claims.  On March 31, 2006, the defendants filed
a petition to coordinate this matter with the City of San Diego case (discussed
below).  On July 12, 2006, that
petition was granted, and, as a result, this case and the City of San Diego case
will now proceed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles.   On January 17, 2007, the defendants
filed demurrers to the City of Los Angeles’ second amended complaint on all
issues other than misjoinder of defendants and claims.  On March 1, 2007, the court denied
defendants’ previously-filed demurrers on grounds of improper joinder of
defendants and claims.  On March 2,
2007, the City of Los Angeles filed a third amended complaint.  On April 11, 2007, the defendants filed
renewed demurrers to the third amended complaint.  On July 27, 2007, the court sustained
the defendants’ demurrers and dismissed the City’s third amended complaint
without prejudice to re-filing upon the exhaustion of the City’s mandatory
administrative procedures for tax collection, and stayed the action pending
such exhaustion.  The City is presently
conducting those administrative procedures.

City of Fairview Heights
v. Orbitz, Inc., et al.

:  On October 5,
2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Circuit Court,
Twentieth Judicial Circuit, St. Clair County, Illinois, by the City of Fairview
Heights on behalf of itself and a putative class of Illinois taxing authorities
that are allegedly authorized to impose a tax on the business of renting hotel
rooms.  In addition to the tax claims,
the complaint also asserts claims for violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud
and Deceptive Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/1, similar laws in other states,
conversion and unjust enrichment.  On November 28,
2005, the Company and certain other defendants removed this action to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.  On January 17, 2006, the defendants
moved to dismiss the complaint.  On February 10,
2006, the City of Fairview Heights moved to remand this action to state
court.  On July 12, 2006, the court
granted defendants’ motion to dismiss all claims other than the tax claim,
denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the tax claim, and denied plaintiff’s
motion to remand.  On August 1,
2007, the City of Fairview Heights moved for class certification.  That motion is pending.

City of Rome, Georgia, et
al., v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On November 18,
2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Georgia by the City of Rome, Hart County and
the City of Cartersville on behalf of themselves and a putative class of
Georgia cities, counties and governments which have enacted transient occupancy
taxes and/or excise taxes on lodging.  In
addition to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for violation of
Georgia’s Uniform Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, conversion, unjust
enrichment, a constructive trust and a declaratory judgment.  On February 6, 2006, the Company and
certain other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On May 8, 2006, the court granted
defendants’ motion to dismiss all claims relating to the Georgia sales and use
tax and denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the excise tax claims.  The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 7,
2006 naming additional plaintiffs.  On February 9,
2007, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ claims for
plaintiffs’ failure to exhaust the administrative procedures required by
Georgia law and plaintiffs’ respective ordinances.  On May 10, 2007, the court denied the
defendants’ motion but concluding that plaintiffs were required to estimate,
assess and attempt to collect the taxes at issue.  The court stayed further litigation to permit
plaintiffs to comply with those administrative procedures.  Since May 10, 2007, certain of the
plaintiffs have sent the Company and other defendants notices of deficiency and
requests for reports regarding hotel


reservation transactions in their respective jurisdictions, to which
the Company and other defendants have responded.

Pitt County v.
Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On December 1, 2005, a
putative class action complaint was filed in the North Carolina General Court
of Justice, Superior Court Division by Pitt County on behalf of itself and a
putative class of North Carolina political subdivisions that impose occupancy
taxes.  In addition to the tax claims,
the complaint also asserts claims for violation of North Carolina General Statute
§ 75-1, et seq., conversion, a constructive trust and a declaratory
judgment.  On February 13, 2006, the
defendants removed this action to the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of North Carolina.  On March 13,
2006, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On March 29, 2007, the court denied
defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. 
On April 13, 2007, the defendants moved for reconsideration of that
decision or, in the alternative, interlocutory appeal.  On August 13, 2007, the court granted
defendants’ motion for reconsideration of the court’s prior order denying the
defendants’ motion to dismiss, and dismissed the action in its entirety.  On September 6, 2007, Pitt County filed
a notice of appeal of that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit.  That appeal is
pending.

City of San Antonio,
Texas v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On May 8,
2006, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division, by the City of
San Antonio on behalf of itself and putative classes of Texas
municipalities.  In addition to the tax
claims, the complaint also asserts claim for conversion and a declaratory
judgment.  On June 30, 2006, the
Company and other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On August 28, 2006, the plaintiff moved
for class certification.  Following
briefing of the motion to dismiss and motion for class certification, on October 30,
2006, the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint that limited the putative
classes of Texas municipalities to 175 specifically enumerated municipalities
that plaintiff alleges to have hotel occupancy tax ordinances similar to that
of the plaintiff.  On March 21,
2007, the court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the City of San Antonio’s
amended complaint.   On May 16 and
17, 2007, the court conducted a hearing on the City of San Antonio’s motion for
class certification.  That motion remains
pending.   On September 7, 2007, the
defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court’s March 21,
2007 order denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss, and that motion was
denied on October 1, 2007.

Lake County Convention
and Visitors Bureau, Inc. and Marshall County v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

: 
On June 12, 2006, a putative class action was filed in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, Hammond Division,
by the Lake County Convention and Visitors Bureau and Marshall County on behalf
of themselves and a putative class of Indiana counties, convention and visitors
bureaus and any other local governments which have enacted or benefit from
taxes on innkeepers.  In addition to the
tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for conversion, unjust enrichment,
and breach of fiduciary duties.  On November 3,
2006, the Company and other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  That motion is pending.

City of Columbus, et al.
v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On August 8,
2006, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio by the cities of Columbus and Dayton on
behalf of themselves and a putative class of Ohio cities, counties and
townships that have enacted occupancy or excise taxes on lodging.  In addition to the tax claims, the complaint
also asserts claims for unjust enrichment, money had and received, conversion,
a constructive trust and a declaratory judgment.   On September 25, 2006, the Company and
other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On September 27, 2006, the Company and
other defendants moved to transfer the case to the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio, where the

City of
Findlay

case (discussed below) is pending.  On January 8, 2007, the Magistrate Judge
issued a report and recommendation that the case be transferred to the Northern
District of Ohio.  Plaintiffs objected to
the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendations.  On July 10, 2007, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Ohio transferred the case to the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  On July 23, 2007, the court in the
Northern District of Ohio granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’


Consumer Sales Practices Act claims and denied defendants’ motion to
dismiss the remaining claims, adopting the reasoning of the court’s opinion on
the motion to dismiss in the

City of Findlay

case.  On August 31, 2007, the
defendants answered the complaint.  On November 5,
2007, the parties jointly moved to consolidate the

City of
Columbus

action with the

City of Findlay

action for pre-trial purposes, and that motion was granted on November 6,
2007.  On February 19, 2008, the
cities of Columbus, Dayton and Findlay moved to amend their respective
complaints to drop all class action allegations and to add nine additional Ohio
municipalities as plaintiffs.   That
motion is pending.

Louisville/Jefferson
County Metro Government v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

: 
On September 21, 2006, a putative class action was filed in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky by the
Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government on behalf of itself and a putative
class of Kentucky cities, counties and townships that have enacted transient
room taxes.  In addition to the tax
claims, the complaint also asserts claims for conversion, money had and
received, unjust enrichment, a constructive trust, and a declaratory
judgment.  On December 15, 2006, the
plaintiff moved to amend the complaint to make certain changes to the identity
of the defendants. That motion was granted, and, on January 8, 2007,
plaintiff filed its amended complaint. 
On December 22, 2006, the defendants moved to dismiss the original
complaint, and, on January 17, 2007, renewed their motion to dismiss with
respect to the amended complaint.  On August 10,
2007, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss.  On September 13, 2007, the defendants
answered.  On October 26, 2007, the
defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court’s order denying the
defendants’ motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, certification of
interlocutory appeal to the Kentucky Supreme Court or the United States Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  On November 9,
2007, the plaintiff moved to strike the defendants’ motion for
reconsideration.  Both motions are
pending.  The plaintiff has stated its
intent to seek to amend its amended complaint to withdraw its class
allegations.

County of Nassau, New
York v. Hotels.com, LP, et al.

:  On October 24,
2006, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of New York by Nassau County on behalf of itself and a
putative class of New York cities, counties and other local governmental
entities that have imposed hotel taxes since March 1, 1995.  In addition to the tax claims, the complaint
also asserts claims for conversion, unjust enrichment and a constructive
trust.  On January 31, 2007, the
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. 
On August 17, 2007, the court granted the defendants’ motion to
dismiss the complaint for the County of Nassau’s failure to exhaust its
mandatory administrative procedures for tax collection.  On September 12, 2007, the County of
Nassau filed a notice of appeal of that order to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit.  That
appeal is pending.

City of Fayetteville v.
Hotels.com, L.P., et al.:

On February 28, 2007, a
putative class action complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Washington
County, Arkansas by the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas on behalf of itself and
a putative class of Arkansas cities, counties and townships that have enacted
uniform hotel taxes on lodging.  In
addition to the claim for hotel taxes, the complaint also asserted claims for a
declaratory judgment, conversion, unjust enrichment, and a constructive
trust.  On July 24, 2007, the City
of Fayetteville filed an amended complaint correcting the names of certain
defendants.  On August 7, 2007, the
defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  That motion is pending.

City of Jefferson,
Missouri v. Hotels.com, LP, et al.

:  On June 27,
2007, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Cole

Actions Filed on Behalf of Individual Cities

Several cities, counties, municipalities and other
political subdivisions across the country have filed actions relating to the
collection of hotel occupancy taxes against the Company and other defendants,
including, but not in all cases, Lowestfare.com Incorporated and Travelweb LLC,

the complaint alleges, among other things, that each of these defendants
violated each jurisdiction’s respective hotel occupancy tax ordinance with
respect to the charges and remittance of amounts to cover taxes under each
ordinance.  Each complaint typically
seeks compensatory damages, disgorgement, penalties available by law, attorneys’
fees and other relief.  Such actions
include:

action with the

City of Atlanta’s failure to exhaust the administrative remedies dictated by

because the City of Atlanta failed to exhaust mandatory administrative remedies
prior to bringing suit.  On January 10,
2007, the City of Atlanta filed a notice of appeal to the court’s order
deciding it lacked jurisdiction.  On October 26,
2007, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Georgia Superior

Consumer Class Actions

Marshall, et al. v.

:  On February 17, 2005, a
putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of

on behalf of themselves and a putative class of allegedly similarly situated
consumers nationwide against the Company. 
The complaint alleged that the Company violated the Delaware Consumer
Fraud Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 2511,

et seq.

,
relating to its disclosures and charges to customers to cover taxes under city
hotel occupancy tax ordinances nationwide, and service fees.  The Company moved to dismiss the complaint on

consumers to cover taxes under city hotel occupancy tax ordinances.  The parties are currently conducting
discovery.  The plaintiffs have stated
their intent to seek leave to amend their complaint.

Bush, et al. v.
Cheaptickets, Inc., et al.

County of Los Angeles by Ronald Bush and three other individuals on behalf of
themselves and other allegedly similarly situated California consumers against
the Company and several of the same defendants as named in the

City of Los Angeles

action (discussed above).  The complaint alleges each of the defendants
engaged in acts of unfair competition in violation of Section 17200
relating to their respective disclosures and charges to customers to cover
taxes under the above ordinances of the City of Los Angeles and other
California cities, and service fees.  The
complaint seeks restitution, relief for alleged conversion, including punitive
damages, injunctive relief, and imposition of a constructive trust.  On July 1, 2005, plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint, adding claims pursuant to California’s Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code §1750,

et seq.

and
claims for breach of contract and the implied duty of good faith and fair
dealing.  On December 2, 2005, the
court ordered limited discovery and ordered that motions challenging the
amended complaint would be coordinated with any


similar motions filed in the

City of Los Angeles

action.  Since that time, the Company has
provided limited discovery and opposed the plaintiffs’ motion to compel further
discovery.

The Company intends to defend vigorously against the
claims in all of the aforementioned proceedings.

Other Possible Actions

inquiries or proposed tax assessments from municipalities and other taxing
jurisdictions relating to its charges and remittance of amounts to cover state

of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Miami-Dade County, Florida, Broward County,
Florida, the City of Anaheim, California, and state tax officials from
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, among others, have begun formal or
informal administrative procedures or stated that they may assert claims
against the Company relating to allegedly unpaid state or local hotel occupancy
or related taxes.  In addition, the State
of New Jersey Department of Taxation has begun an audit related to the state’s
Corporation Business Tax.  The Company is
unable at this time to predict whether any such proceedings or assertions will
result in litigation.

The Company intends to defend vigorously against the
claims in all of the aforementioned proceedings.

Litigation Related to Securities Matters

On March 16, March 26, April 27, and June 5,
2001, respectively, four putative class action complaints were filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York naming priceline.com, Inc.,
Richard S. Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &
Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., BancBoston
Robertson Stephens, Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as defendants
(01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ. 3590 and 01 Civ. 4956).  Shives

et
al

.

v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

.

,
01 Civ. 4956, also names other defendants and states claims unrelated to the
Company.  The complaints allege, among
other things, that priceline.com and the individual defendants violated the
federal securities laws by issuing and selling priceline.com common stock in
priceline.com’s March 1999 initial public offering without disclosing to
investors that some of the underwriters in the offering, including the lead
underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received excessive and undisclosed
commissions from certain investors.  By
Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these
cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes with hundreds of other cases,
which contain allegations concerning the allocation of shares in the initial
public offerings of companies other than priceline.com, Inc.  By Order of Judge Scheindlin dated August 14,
2001, the following cases were consolidated for all purposes:  01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576; and 01 Civ.
3590.  On April 19, 2002, plaintiffs
filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these cases.  This Consolidated Amended Class Action
Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with respect
to both the Company’s March 1999 initial public offering and the Company’s
August 1999 second public offering of common stock.  The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc.,
Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman,
Timothy G. Brier, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs &
Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson
Stephens, Inc. (as successor-in-interest to BancBoston), Credit Suisse
First Boston Corp. (as successor-in-interest to Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp.), Allen & Co., Inc. and Salomon Smith
Barney, Inc.  Priceline, Richard
Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier,
together with other issuer defendants in the consolidated litigation, filed a
joint motion to dismiss on July 15, 2002. 
On November 18, 2002, the cases against the individual defendants
were dismissed without prejudice and without costs.  In addition, counsel for plaintiffs and the
individual defendants executed Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements,
which toll the statutes of limitations on plaintiffs’ claims against those
individuals.  On February 19, 2003,
Judge Scheindlin issued an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in
part the issuer’s motion.  None of the
claims against the Company were dismissed.


On June 26, 2003, counsel for the plaintiff class announced that
they and counsel for the issuers had agreed to the form of a Memorandum of
Understanding (the “Memorandum”) to settle claims against the issuers.  The terms of that Memorandum provide that class
members will be guaranteed $1 billion in recoveries by the insurers of the
issuers and that settling issuer defendants will assign to the class members
certain claims that they may have against the underwriters.  Issuers also agree to limit their abilities
to bring certain claims against the underwriters.  If recoveries in excess of $1 billion are
obtained by the class from any non-settling defendants, the settling defendants’
monetary obligations to the class plaintiffs will be satisfied; any amount recovered
from the underwriters that is less than $1 billion will be paid by the insurers
on behalf of the issuers.  The
Memorandum, which is subject to the approval of each issuer, was approved by a
special committee of the priceline.com Board of Directors on Thursday, July 3,
2003.  Thereafter, counsel for the
plaintiff class and counsel for the issuers agreed to the form of a Stipulation
and Agreement of Settlement with Defendant Issuers and Individuals (“Settlement
Agreement”).  The Settlement Agreement implements
the Memorandum and contains the same material provisions.  On June 11, 2004, a special committee of
the priceline.com Board of Directors authorized the Company’s counsel to
execute the Settlement Agreement on behalf of the Company.  The Settlement Agreement was submitted to the
Court for approval.  Subsequently, the
Second Circuit reversed the District Court’s granting of class certification in
certain of the related class actions.  As
a result, the parties entered into a stipulation and order dated June 25,
2007 which terminated the Settlement Agreement. 
The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims in all these
proceedings.

On May 3, 2007, the
Company entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (“Settlement
Agreement”) to settle a class action lawsuit brought after its announcement
that third quarter 2000 revenues would not meet expectations.  Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement,
the class received $80 million in return for a release, with prejudice, of all
claims against the Company and the individual defendants (the “Settling
Defendants”) that are related to the purchase of the Company’s securities by
class members during the class period. 
The Company’s insurance carriers funded $30 million of the settlement.  As a result, the Company recorded a 2007 net
charge of approximately $55.4 million representing its share of the cost
to settle the litigation and cover related expenses.

The Company will continue to assess the risks of the
potential financial impact of these matters, and to the extent appropriate, it
will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

Other Litigation

On January 6, 1999, we
received notice that a third party patent applicant and patent attorney, Thomas
G. Woolston, purportedly had filed in December 1998 with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office a request to declare an interference between a
patent application filed by Woolston and our U.S. Patent 5,794,207.  We are currently awaiting information from the
Patent Office regarding whether it will initiate an interference proceeding.

From time to time, we have been
and expect to continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the
ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of third
party intellectual property rights.  Such
claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources, divert management’s attention from our
business objectives and could adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

Overview

General

. 
We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad
range of travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals,
vacation packages, cruises and destination services.  In the United States, we offer our customers
a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a traditional,
price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique

Name Your Own Price

®

service, which allows our customers to make
offers for travel services at discounted prices.  Internationally, we offer our customers hotel
room reservations in 60 countries and 22 languages.

We launched our business in the United States in 1998
under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to
include, among others, the brands Booking.com and Active Hotels in Europe and
Agoda in Asia.  Our goal is to be the
leading worldwide online hotel reservation service and be the top online
discount travel agent in the United States. 
At present, we derive substantially all of our revenues from the
following sources:

Over the last several years, our business has
transitioned from one driven primarily by domestic results to one driven
primarily by international results. 
Prior to 2004, substantially all of our revenues were generated within
the United States.  In September 2004,
we acquired Booking.com Limited, a U.K.-based online hotel service, in July 2005,
we acquired Booking.com B.V., a Netherlands-based online hotel service, and in November 2007,
we acquired Agoda Company, Ltd. (“Agoda”) and AGIP LLC (“AGIP,” and together
with Agoda, the “Agoda Companies”), an online hotel service with operations in
Singapore and Thailand.  During the year
ended December 31, 2007, our international business — the significant
majority of which is currently generated by our European operations —
represented approximately 55% of our gross bookings, and contributed more than
two-thirds of our consolidated operating income during that period.  We expect that throughout 2008 and beyond,
our international business will represent a growing percentage of our total
gross bookings and operating income.


International Trends

.  The size of
the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than
that within the United States. 
Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of
international consumers have trailed those of the United States.  However, international consumers are rapidly
moving to online means for purchasing travel. 
Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have
substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed the growth rates
within the United States.  In addition,
the base of hotel suppliers in Europe is particularly fragmented compared to
that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel
chains.  We believe online reservation
systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels
more commonly found outside of the United States.  We believe these trends have enabled us to
become the top hotel service provider in Europe, and will allow us to
successfully expand our service offerings internationally beyond Europe.

As our international operations have become significant
contributors to our results and international hotel bookings have become of
increased importance to our earnings, we have seen, and expect to continue to
see, changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics.  For example, because our international
operations utilize online affiliate and search marketing as the principal means
of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising expense has
increased significantly since our acquisition of those companies, a trend we
expect to continue throughout 2008 and beyond. 
In addition, and as discussed in more detail below, since the
acquisitions of Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V., we have seen the
effects of seasonal fluctuations on our operating results change as a result of
different revenue recognition policies that apply to our price-disclosed
services (including our international hotel service) as compared to our

Name Your Own Price

®

services.

Another impact of the growing importance that our
international operations represent to our business is our increased exposure to
foreign currency exchange risk.  Because
we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the
United States and are reporting our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure
to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our
international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars
upon consolidation.  Our international
operations contributed approximately $372.6 million to our revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2007, which compares to $182.7 million for the
same period in 2006.  Approximately $30.3
million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates.  If the U.S. dollar weakens
against the local currency, the translation of these
foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net
revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss.  Similarly, our net assets, net revenues,
operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar
strengthens against local currency.

Domestic
Trends

.  While the online market for travel services
continues to experience significant annualized growth, we believe that the
domestic market share of third-party distributors, like priceline.com, has
declined over the recent past and that the growth of the domestic online market
for travel services has slowed.  We
believe the decline in market share is attributable, in part, to a concerted initiative
by travel suppliers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to
reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their
pricing.  In addition, airlines and hotel
chains have generally experienced year-over-year increases in load factors (a
common metric that measures airplane customer usage) and occupancy rates (a
common metric that measures hotel customer usage), respectively, which leaves
them with less excess supply to provide third party intermediaries like
priceline.com.  Recent decreases in
domestic airline capacity could further reduce the amount of airline tickets
available to us.  Notwithstanding these
trends, we continue to believe that the market for domestic online travel
services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth.

The financial prospects of our domestic business have
historically been significantly dependent upon the sale of leisure airline
tickets and, as a result, the health of our domestic business has been impacted
by the health of the airline industry. 
While the sale of leisure airline tickets remains an important part of
our business, revenue earned in connection with the domestic reservation of
hotel room nights has come to represent a substantial majority of our domestic
gross profit.  The domestic hotel


market has been characterized in recent years by robust demand and
limited supply, leading to increased occupancy rates, and in turn, increased
average daily rates (“ADRs”).  Because
our remuneration for agency hotel transactions increases proportionately with
room price, increased ADRs generally have a positive effect on our agency hotel
business.  Higher ADRs, however, can also
negatively affect consumer demand, and higher occupancy rates can lead hotels
to restrict our access to merchant hotel availability, particularly in high
occupancy destinations popular with our travel base.  Higher occupancy rates also have historically
tended to drive lower margins as hotel suppliers have less need to distribute through
third-party intermediaries such as us.

Recently, significant attention has been given to the
state of the United States economy and concern has been expressed regarding
certain recessionary trends.  We do not
believe that our 2007 financial results were impacted by a slowdown in the
United States economy, and we believe that our brands and services are
attractive to consumers and suppliers in times of economic stress.  There can be no assurance, however, that our
business would not be adversely affected if current economic conditions
continue or worsen.

We also rely on fees paid to us by global distribution
systems, or GDSs, for travel bookings made through GDSs for a portion of our
gross profit and a substantial portion of our operating income.  Connectivity to a GDS does not guarantee us
access to the content of a travel supplier such as an airline or hotel
company.  We have agreements with a
number of suppliers to obtain access to content, and are in continuing
discussions with others to obtain similar access.  If we were denied access to a suppliers’ full
content or had to incur service fees in order to access or book such content,
our results could suffer.

We believe that our success will depend in large part
on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our hotel business, to
continue to promote the priceline.com brand in the United States, the
Booking.com brand internationally, the Agoda brand in Asia and, over time, to
offer other travel services and further expand into other international
markets. Factors beyond our control, such as the outbreak of an epidemic or
pandemic disease; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis or
earthquakes; terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East or elsewhere; or
the withdrawal from our system of a major hotel supplier, could adversely
affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to
effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above.  We intend to continue to invest in marketing
and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with
attempts to improve operating results. 
We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we
explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other
things, mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we currently do not have
operations in geographic areas such as South America, and therefore may
consider strategic alternatives in those areas. 
Our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to
maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the
prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we
cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability.

Seasonality

.  Our

Name Your Own Price

®

services are non-refundable
in nature, and accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking
is generated.  However, we recognize
revenue generated from our retail hotel services, including our international
operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel.  As a result, a meaningful amount of retail
hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve
their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized as revenue until
future quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense the substantial
majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically
in the quarter in which bookings are generated. 
Therefore, as our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our
quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting
policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to
our financial position and results of operations and require us to make
difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies,
our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be
used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below.
Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms
of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.  A
summary of our significant accounting policies that involve significant
estimates and judgments of management, including the following:

·

Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance

. 
As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” we
periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets,
and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation
allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider
many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our
deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by
taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods
available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.  Based upon management’s assessment of
positive and negative evidence, we recorded non-cash tax benefits in 2007, 2006
and 2005 of $47.9 million, $28.1 million and $170.5 million, respectively,
resulting from a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our
deferred tax assets.  We believe that it
is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will not be
realized and, accordingly, a valuation allowance against those assets remains.  The valuation allowance may need to be
adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change.

·

Stock-Based Compensation.

We record stock-based compensation expense over the
service period based upon the grant date fair value of equity-based
grants.  We estimate forfeiture rates in
determining the amount of compensation to record.  In addition, we record stock-based
compensation expense for grants that include a performance contingency based
upon the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period.  We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based
compensation recorded when estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted, or when the
probable outcome for performance-based shares is updated based upon changes in
facts and circumstances.

·

Accounting for State and Local “Hotel
Occupancy” Taxes

.  As discussed in Note 17 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements, several jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against
several on-line travel companies, including us, alleging among other things,
that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the
price paid by a customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room.
Historically, we have not collected taxes on this differential. Additional
state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or
hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such
taxes, either retroactively or prospectively, or both. To the extent that any
tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility
applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might
have additional tax exposures.  We will continue to assess the risks of
the potential financial impact of additional tax exposures, and to the extent
appropriate, we reserve for those estimated liabilities.


·

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts.

Because we act as merchant of record in
the majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting
fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with
our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent
credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of
record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting
credit card charge-backs. In addition, in connection with hotel agency
transactions, we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past
experience and the age of commissions receivable.

·

Valuation of Goodwill

. 
We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired
including Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited, Travelweb, the Agoda Companies
and priceline.com europe Ltd. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for
impairment using appropriate valuation techniques.  In the event that future circumstances
indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge
would be recorded.

·

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and
Intangibles.

We evaluate whether events or
circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of
long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The
significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review
include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use
of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future
operating results; and negative industry or economic trends.  In evaluating an asset for possible
impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to
measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is
not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted
cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.

·

Airline Debit Memos.

Our airline suppliers periodically send
us debit memos that make claims for additional amounts due to them related to
the cost of airline tickets we sold on their behalf.  We process the debit memos received and, when
appropriate, make payments to the airlines. 
Based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with
the airlines, we establish reserves for estimated losses when appropriate
resulting from these claims.

Results of Operations

Year
Ended December 31, 2007 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006

Operating
Metrics

Our financial results are driven by certain operating
metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel
services.  Specifically, sales of airline
tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units
purchased by our customers.  Gross
Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all
travel services purchased by our customers. 
International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated
principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross
bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross
bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by,
operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic
operations, in each case without regard to the location of the travel or the
customer purchasing the travel.


Gross bookings resulting from airline tickets, hotel
room nights and rental car days sold through our domestic and international
operations in 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

Gross bookings resulting from airline tickets, hotel
room nights and rental car days sold through our agency and merchant models in
2007 and 2006 were as follows:

Gross bookings increased by 45.5% for the year ended December 31,
2007, compared to the same period in 2006. 
The increase was primarily attributable to 98.6% growth in our
international gross bookings, virtually all of which relates to retail hotel
room night sales (including the $223 million favorable impact of foreign
currency exchange rates).  Domestic gross
bookings increased by 9.2%, primarily due to growth in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

hotel room nights, retail airline tickets due
to the elimination of booking fees in June of 2007 and

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car
days, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets.

Agency gross bookings increased 64.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2007, due to growth in our international hotel
operations and in the sale of retail airline tickets due to the elimination of
booking fees in June of 2007. 
Merchant gross bookings increased 9.3% for the year ended December 31,
2007, due to an increase n the sale of

Name
Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights and an increase in the sale
of

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car
days, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets.

Airline tickets sold increased by 4.8% for the year
ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006.  The increase in the number of airline tickets
sold in the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in
2006, was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of retail airline
tickets, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets.  Retail airline ticket bookings
increased primarily due to our elimination of booking fees in June 2007.


Hotel room nights sold increased by 48.9% for the year
ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006, primarily due to an
increase in the sale of agency room nights in connection with our international
operations as well as an increase in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights in the United
States.

Rental car days sold increased by 15.6% for the year
ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006, due to increases in
sales of both our

Name Your Own Price

®

and retail
rental car services.

Revenues

We classify our revenue into three categories:

·

Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where
we are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things,
collecting receipts from our customers, selecting suppliers and remitting
payments to our suppliers.  Merchant
revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price
of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction
revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged
by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant
price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in
connection with the sale of

Name Your Own
Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars
and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS
reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions.

·

Agency revenues are derived from travel related
transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of
our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel
commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees related
to certain of the aforementioned transactions and are reported at the net
amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. In June 2007, we
eliminated processing fees on the priceline.com price-disclosed airline ticket
service.

·

Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising
on our websites.

We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our
travel business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of
domestic point-of-sale travel services to a business that includes significant
sales of international point-of-sale hotel services, a significant majority of
which are currently generated in Europe. 
Because our domestic services include merchant

Name Your Own Price

®

travel
services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and
international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis,
revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale
of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has
become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our
business.  Our international operations
contributed approximately $372.6 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31,
2007, which compares to $182.7 million for the same period in 2006.  Approximately $30.3 million of this increase
is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.


Merchant
Revenues

Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31,
2007 increased 10.9% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily due to an
increase in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

and merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights
and

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car days, partially offset by a
decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets.  In addition, as more fully discussed in Note
17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded excise tax refunds of
$18.6 million in merchant revenues in the year ended December 31, 2007.

Agency
Revenues

Agency revenues for the year ended December 31,
2007 increased 86.2% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result
of growth in our international operations, which contributed $367 million of
agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, and $179 million of
agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $30.0
million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates.  These increases were partially
offset by declines in agency revenue related to the sale of price-disclosed
airline tickets, for which priceline.com ceased charging processing fees in June 2007.

Other
Revenues

Other revenues during the year ended December 31,
2007 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees
for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing
services.  Other revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2007 increased 65.7%, compared to the same period in
2006, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues due to new
advertising partner relationships in 2007.

Cost of
Revenues and Gross Profit


Cost of
Revenues

During the year ended December 31, 2007, cost of
revenues entirely reflect merchant

Name Your
Own Price

®

transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross”
with a corresponding cost of revenue while retail transactions are recorded “net”
with no corresponding cost of revenues.

Cost of
Merchant Revenues

For the year ended December 31, 2007, cost of
merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel
rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of opaque
airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax,
segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale
of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our
suppliers, net of applicable taxes.  Cost
of merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 6.6%,
compared to the same period in 2006, due primarily to the increase in merchant
revenue discussed above.  Merchant
price-disclosed hotel revenues are recorded at their net amounts, which are
amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there are no
associated costs of merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues.

Cost of
Agency Revenues

Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount,
which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and
therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues.

Cost of
Other Revenues

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
there were no costs of other revenues.

Gross Profit

Total gross profit for the year ended December 31,
2007 increased by 59.4% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a
result of increased revenue.  Total gross
margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased
during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in
2006, because

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions,
whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue,
represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to retail,
price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no
corresponding cost of revenues.  Gross
profit and gross margin were also positively impacted by the $18.6 million
excise tax refund recorded in merchant revenue in the year ended December 31,
2007 (see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).  Because

Name
Your Own Price

®

transactions are reported “gross” and retail
transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross
profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our
business.


Merchant
Gross Profit

Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues
less the cost of merchant revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
merchant gross profit increased from the same period in 2006, primarily due to
an increase in merchant revenue. 
Merchant gross margin increased primarily because

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions,
whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue,
represented a smaller percentage of transactions in the year ended December 31,
2007, when compared to merchant price-disclosed hotel transactions, which are
recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues.  In addition, merchant gross margin for the
year ended December 31, 2007, was positively affected by the excise tax
refund of $18.6 million included in merchant revenue (see Note 17 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Agency gross profit consists of
agency revenues, which are recorded net of agency costs, if any.  For the

year ended December 31, 2007, agency gross profit increased over the same
period in 2006, primarily as a result of growth in bookings for retail agency
hotel room nights for our international operations.

Other
Gross Profit

During the year ended December 31, 2007, other
gross profit increased from the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of
higher online advertising revenues due to new advertising partner relationships
in 2007.


Operating Expenses

Advertising

Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the
expenses associated with domestic television, radio and print advertising; and (2) agency
fees, the cost for creative talent and production costs for television, radio
and print advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2007, offline
advertising expenses were higher than in the same period in 2006 primarily as a
result of increased television and print advertising related to our “Negotiator”
advertising campaign, partially offset by a decrease in radio advertising.  Online advertising expenses primarily consist
of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate
programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail
campaigns.  For the year ended December 31,
2007, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2006,
primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses to support
significantly increased retail agency hotel room nights booked by our
international operations, which rely primarily on online advertising, in
particular keyword purchases and payments to affiliate advertisers, to drive
their businesses, partially offset by the elimination of advertising fees paid
under our agreement with Orbitz, which expired on December 31, 2006, and
the impact of higher efficiency requirements (i.e., higher internal “return on investment”
criteria) on other online spend.

Sales
and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit
card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid
to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions
for credit card chargebacks.  For the
year ended December 31, 2007, sales and marketing expenses, which are
substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2006,
primarily due to increased gross booking volumes.


Personnel

Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our
personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and
stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2007, personnel
expenses increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to increased
personnel expenses associated with head count growth of our international
operations and increased employee performance bonus expense.  Stock-based compensation expense was
approximately $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $14.9
million, for the year ended December 31, 2006.

General
and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily
of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy
expenses; and (3) personnel related expenses. General and administrative
expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same
period during 2006, due to (1) a $55.4 million expense related to our net
cost of a litigation settlement, including related legal fees (see Note 17 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements), (2) a $1.7 million one-time
receipt of certain franchise tax credits in the third quarter 2006, (3) additional
fees for outside professionals and expenses related to pending litigation, and (4) increased
general and administrative expenses, particularly occupancy and personnel
related expenses, associated with the growth of our international operations.

Information Technology

Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) outsourced
data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (2) system
maintenance and software license fees; (3) data communications and other
expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to
outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the increase in
information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2006, was
primarily associated with the growth of our international operations.


Depreciation
and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses consist
of:  (1) amortization of intangible
assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed
and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation
of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures.  For the year ended December 31, 2007,
depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2006,
primarily as a result of increased depreciation and amortization related to
investment in our international operations.

Interest

For the

year ended December 31, 2007, interest income on cash and marketable
securities increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher
prevailing interest rates and significantly higher cash balances throughout
2007, and including approximately $3.3 million of interest received on our
excise tax refund.  Interest expense increased
for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the same period in 2006, due primarily to increased average debt
balances in 2007, as well as an increase in prevailing interest rates on the
variable portion of the interest rate swap agreement related to our 1%
Convertible Senior Notes.

Income tax benefit for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006 differs from the expected tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate
of 35% primarily because it includes benefits amounting to $47.9 and $28.1
million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of the valuation
allowance on our deferred tax assets. 
Other items resulting in a difference between our effective tax rate and
the statutory rate include a tax benefit of approximately $3.6 million
resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carryforwards in
2007, the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt and
lower foreign tax rates, partly offset by state income taxes in 2007 and
2006.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, the
Netherlands enacted a reduction in its statutory tax rate from 29.6% to 25.5%, effective
January 1, 2007.  In the third
quarter of 2007, the United Kingdom enacted a reduction in its statutory tax
rate from 30% to 28%, effective April 1, 2008.  We recognized benefits of $1.3 million and
$3.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
resulting from the impact on deferred taxes of these enacted statutory tax rate
reductions.  Due to our significant net
operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay significant U.S. federal
income taxes for the foreseeable future. 
We expect to make cash payments for U.S. alternative minimum tax and for
certain international taxes.

change in equity in income of investees and minority interests versus the prior
year was primarily due to an increase in the minority interest in the earnings
of priceline.com International.  Also,
the prior year includes a $1.1 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2006 compared to Year Ended December 31,

Operating Metrics

Our
financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the
selling activity generated by our travel services.  Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel
room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our
customers.  Gross Bookings capture the
total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased
by our customers.

The
number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through
our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows:

Gross
bookings increased by 49.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared
to the same period in 2005.  The increase
was driven primarily by an increase of 85.6% in “agency” bookings for the year
ended December 31, 2006, which was primarily attributable to (1) growth
in our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005
and 2004, respectively; (2) an increase in the average fare of our retail
ticket service, and (3) the increased sale of retail rental cars.  Merchant gross bookings increased by 8.3% for
the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005.  The increase was primarily due to an increase
in merchant gross bookings relating to our domestic retail hotel service, an
increase in the average daily rate of our

hotel service and an increase in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car days.

Airline
tickets sold increased by 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over
the same period in 2005.  The increase in
the number of airline tickets sold in the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to the same period in 2005, was primarily attributable to an increase
in the sale of retail airline tickets, partially offset by a decrease in the
sale of

®

airline tickets.

Hotel room nights sold
increased by 58.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same
period in 2005.  The increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in
the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005, was
primarily due to growth in our hotel room nights sold through (1) our
European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and
Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and
2004, respectively, and (2) our domestic retail hotel service.  This
increase was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights.  Our retail hotel service benefited from the
enhanced integration of our retail and

Name
Your Own Price

®

services in the first quarter of
2006.   We believe that the benefit
to our retail hotel service came partially at the expense of sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights during the
year ended December 31, 2006, as some amount of demand that may otherwise
have been directed to the

Name Your Own
Price

®

service instead was directed to our retail
hotel service.

Rental
car days sold increased by 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006,
over the same period in 2005, due to increases in sales of both our retail and

Name Your Own Price

rental car services, which benefited from the
launch of enhanced integration of retail and

Name

®

services in


the
first quarter 2006, as well as from the launch of new features in 2005,
including options for one-way destination and off-airport car rentals.

We
continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket business from a
business historically focused exclusively on the sale of merchant (“opaque”)

Name Your Own Price

®

travel services to a business
that includes the sale of retail, price-disclosed travel services.  Because merchant

Name Your Own Price

®

travel
services are reported on a “gross” basis and retail travel services are
primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are
impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel
services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important
measure of evaluating growth in our business. 
Additionally, our European operations contributed approximately $182.7 million
to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, which are primarily
recorded on a “net” basis.

Merchant Revenues

Merchant
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 5.2% compared to
the same period in 2005, primarily due to an increase in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car
days,

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights, and vacation packages.  A substantial portion of the increase was due
to services sold through our agreement with Orbitz, which we entered into on January 1,
2006.  Under our agreement with Orbitz,
we paid fees in exchange for a link on the Orbitz website that directed traffic
to the

Name Your Own Price

®

service. 
The agreement expired on December 31, 2006.  While the Orbitz agreement provided us with a
good source of traffic, we believe it was likely dilutive in that many of the
customers that we paid Orbitz for may have purchased our travel services
anyway.  While the expiration of the
Orbitz agreement may result in decreased merchant volume in 2007 — we estimate
potentially up to approximately 5% of our 2007 merchant volume after taking
into account estimated dilution - it frees up marketing dollars that we may use
in other online channels.

Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 116% compared to
the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of (1) growth in our
European operations, which contributed $179 million of agency revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2006, and $67 million of agency revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2005; and (2) increased sales of domestic
retail hotel room nights and retail rental car days.  Results from our European operations are
substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were
acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively.


Other Revenues

Other
revenues during the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising
revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com
for home financing services.  Other
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 19.7%, compared to
the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of higher online advertising
revenue related to the inclusion of results of operation from our online
advertising company since it was acquired in June 2006.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of Revenues

During the year ended December 31,
2006, cost of revenues increased 3.9%, compared to the same period in 2005, due
primarily to the fact that merchant revenues increased comparably in the same
period.  Cost of revenues entirely
reflect merchant

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross”
with a corresponding cost of revenue while retail transactions are recorded “net”
with no corresponding cost of revenues.

Cost of Merchant Revenues

For the year ended December 31,
2006, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of
opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the
cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air
transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in
connection with the sale of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of opaque
rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes.  Cost of merchant revenues for the year ended December 31,
2006 increased 4.0%, compared to the same period in 2005, due primarily to the
fact that merchant revenues increased comparably in the same period.  Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are
recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to
suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant
price-disclosed hotel revenues.


Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less
amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency
revenues.  For the year ended December 31,
2005, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash amortization
expenses associated with acquisition activity.

Cost of Other Revenues

For the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, there were no costs of other revenues.

Gross Profit

Total gross profit for the
year ended December 31, 2006 increased by 49.7% compared to the same
period in 2005, primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) our
European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and
Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and
2004, respectively; and (2) increased sales of retail hotel room
nights.  The contribution to gross profit
from airline ticket sales during the year ended December 31, 2006 was
negatively impacted by a decrease in net GDS fees per ticket as compared to the
same period in 2005, which contributed to lower margins on retail ticket sales
in particular. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of
total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared
to the same period in 2005, because

Name
Your Own Price

®

transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross”
with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of
transactions compared to retail, price-disclosed transactions which are
primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues.  Because

Name
Your Own Price

®

transactions are reported “gross” and retail
transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross
profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our
business.

Merchant Gross Profit

Merchant
gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, merchant gross profit increased from
the same period in 2005, primarily due to an increase in the sale of domestic
merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and

Name
Your Own Price

®

rental car days.  The contribution to merchant gross profit
from

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket sales during the year ended December 31,
2006 was negatively impacted by a decrease in net GDS fees per ticket as
compared to the same period in 2005.  A
substantial portion of the increase in merchant gross profit was due to
services sold through our agreement with Orbitz, as discussed above.  Our agreement with Orbitz expired on December 31,
2006.  Merchant gross margin increased
primarily because

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross”
with a corresponding


cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in
the year ended December 31, 2006, when compared to merchant
price-disclosed hotel transactions, which are recorded “net” with no
corresponding cost of revenues.

Agency Gross Profit

Agency
gross profit consists of agency revenues, which are recorded net of agency
costs, if any.  For the

year ended December 31,
2006, agency gross profit increased over
the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of (1) growth in our
European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were
acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively; and (2) increased
sales of retail hotel room nights and rental car days.

Other Gross Profit

During the year ended December 31,
2006, other gross profit increased from the same period in 2005 primarily as a
result of higher online advertising revenues related to including results of
operations from our online advertising company since it was acquired in June 2006.

Operating Expenses

Advertising

Offline
advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated
with domestic television, radio and print advertising; and (2) agency
fees, the cost for creative talent and production costs for television and
radio commercials. For the year ended December 31, 2006, offline
advertising expenses were slightly higher than in the same period in 2005.  Online advertising expenses primarily consist
of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate
programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail
advertisements.  For the year ended December 31,
2006, online advertising expenses increased significantly over the same period
in 2005, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses related to
(1) supporting the growth of our European operations, which rely primarily
on online advertising to drive their businesses and (2) an increase in our
domestic online advertising, including fees paid pursuant to our agreement with
Orbitz.


Sales and Marketing

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing
fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party
service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions for
credit card chargebacks.  For the year
ended December 31, 2006, sales and marketing expenses, which are
substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2005,
primarily due to increased gross booking volumes.

Personnel

Personnel
expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses,
taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year
ended December 31, 2006, personnel expenses increased over the same period
in 2005, primarily due to increased personnel expenses associated with head
count growth of our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005
and 2004, respectively, increased employee performance bonus expense and an
increase in stock-based compensation due mainly to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on
January 1, 2006, which requires companies to record non-cash compensation
expense related to stock-based awards granted to employees.  Stock-based compensation expense was
approximately $14.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006, and
approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

General
and Administrative

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside
professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) business
insurance. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31,
2006, over the same period during 2005, due to increased general and
administrative expenses associated with the growth of our European operations,
which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited,
which


were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
additional fees for outside professionals and expenses related to pending
litigation.  This increase was partially
offset by the one-time receipt of certain franchise tax credits from the state
of Connecticut in the amount of approximately $1.7 million.

Information
Technology

Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system
maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other
expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (3) payments to
outside contractors. For the year ended December 31, 2006, information
technology expenses decreased domestically from the same period in 2005, in
part due to efficiencies resulting from the integration of Travelweb’s
operations.  This decrease was partially
offset by increased information technology expenses associated with our
European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and
Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation
and amortization expenses consist of:  (1) amortization
of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of
internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer
equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office
equipment and furniture and fixtures. 
For the year ended December 31, 2006, depreciation and amortization
expense increased from the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of
increased non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with
our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V.
and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and
2004, respectively.


Restructuring Charge, net

In
the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $135,000 related to vacated leased property.  In the year ended December 31, 2005, we
recorded a net restructuring charge of approximately $1.7 million, consisting
of a $2 million restructuring charge related to vacated leased property and a
$336,000 restructuring reversal related to estimated costs to complete certain
restructuring activities in Europe.

Interest

For
the

year ended December 31,
2006, interest income on cash and marketable
securities increased over the same period in 2005, primarily due to higher
prevailing interest rates and significantly higher cash balances in the fourth
quarter of 2006.  Interest expense
increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the same period in 2005, due primarily to an
increase in debt balances in 2006, as well as an increase in prevailing
interest rates on the variable portion of the interest rate swap agreement
related to our 1% Convertible Senior Notes.

Taxes

Income
tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 differs from
the expected tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% because it includes
benefits amounting to $28.1 million and $170.5 million, respectively, resulting
from a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax
assets.  Other items resulting in a
difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate include the
foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt, and lower foreign
tax rates, partly offset by state income taxes. 
In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Netherlands enacted a reduction in
its statutory tax rate from 29.6% to 25.5%, effective January 1,
2007.  We recognized a benefit of $3.0
million in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulting from the impact on deferred
taxes of the Netherlands tax rate reduction. 
Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not
expect to pay significant cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income tax for
the foreseeable future.  We expect to
make cash payments for U.S. alternative minimum tax and for certain
international taxes.


Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and
Minority Interests

Equity
in income (loss) of investees and minority interests for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, represented (1) minority interests associated with the
ownership of priceline.com International that is held by certain managers of
that business; and (2) equity in income (loss) of investees, principally
comprised of our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results.  The change in equity in income of investees
and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase
in the minority interest in the earnings of priceline.com International and a
decrease in earnings of and an impairment charge recorded for our investment in
pricelinemortgage.com.  Due to recent
losses incurred by pricelinemortgage.com, we reviewed the carrying value of our
investment for impairment.  Based upon
recent operating results and future projected results, we determined that our
investment was impaired on an other-than-temporary basis.  Accordingly, in the third quarter, we
recognized a charge of $1.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our equity
investment in pricelinemortgage.com to its estimated fair value.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The
following discussion gives effect to the restatement as discussed in
Note 21 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31,
2007, we had $507.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments.  We generally invest excess
cash to make such funds readily available for operating purposes.  Cash equivalents and short-term investments
are primarily comprised of highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt
instruments.

All
of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front
from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent
date.  We therefore tend to experience
significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our
cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter.  This can cause volatility in working capital
levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would
indicate.

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2007, was $156.0 million, resulting from net income of $157.1 million, non-cash
items not affecting 2007 cash flows of $18.9 million offset by $19.9 million of
negative changes in working capital.  Net
income includes a charge of $55.4 million paid to settle litigation, $21.9
million received in excise tax refunds and related interest (see Note 17 to our
Consolidated financial Statements for further information regarding the
litigation settlement and excise tax refund) and a $1.2 million favorable
litigation settlement related to credit card processing fees.  The changes in working capital for the year
ended December 31, 2007, were primarily related to a $33.4 million
increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets,
partially offset by a $9.8 million increase in accounts payable, accrued
expenses and other current liabilities. 
The increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily
due to significant revenue growth for our international operations.  Accrued expenses and other current
liabilities increased primarily due to a $5.3 million increase in bonus
accruals and a $3.6 million increase in online advertising accruals.  We do not believe there has been any
significant change in credit risk regarding our accounts receivable.  Non-cash items were primarily associated with
deferred income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and
amortization, primarily related to acquisition-related intangible assets.  The deferred income tax benefit resulted
primarily from the $47.9 million non-cash reversal of a portion of our deferred
income tax valuation allowance, as well as a $3.6 million non-recurring income
tax benefit resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carry
forwards in the fourth quarter


of
2007.  Net cash provided by operating
activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $112.1 million,
resulting from net income of $74.5 million, non-cash items not affecting 2006
cash flows of $32.7 million and $4.9 million of positive changes in working
capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31,
2006, were primarily related to a $27.4 million increase in accounts payable,
accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $21.2
million increase in accounts receivable. The increases in accounts receivable
and accounts payable were primarily due to an increase in merchant bookings in
the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. Accrued
expenses and other current liabilities increased primarily due to an $8.2
million increase in bonus accruals and a $5.0 million increase in on-line
advertising accruals. Non-cash items were primarily associated with deferred
income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and
amortization, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our
acquisitions of Travelweb, Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V. The
non-cash deferred income tax benefit resulted primarily from the $28.1 million
reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax valuation allowance.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $221.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2007.  Investing activities were affected
by $116.1 million of net purchases of investments for the year ended December 31,
2007, and the purchase of $76.1 million of stock in priceline.com
International held by minority interest shareholders.  In addition, in the year ended December 31,
2007, we invested $14.6 million, net of cash acquired, in acquisitions, the
substantial majority of which related to the Agoda Companies.  Net cash provided by investing activities was
$49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Investing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2006 were affected by $64.9 million of net redemptions of
short-term investments, partially offset by the purchase of $19.8 million
of stock in priceline.com International held by minority interest shareholders.
Additionally, restricted cash decreased by $19.9 million in 2006 as we are no
longer required to collateralize outstanding letters of credit with restricted
cash balances. Cash invested in purchases of property and equipment was $15.9
million and $12.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately $19.4

million for the
year ended December 31, 2007.  The
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31,
2007 was primarily related to $19.8 million of proceeds from the exercise
of employee stock options and $3.6 million of excess tax benefits from
stock-based compensation, partially offset by $2.6 million of treasury
stock purchases and $1.3 million of debt issuance costs.  Net cash provided by financing activities was
approximately $177.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The cash provided by financing
activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily related
to the issuance of $345 million of senior convertible notes and $14.1 million
of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by $135.8
million of treasury stock purchases, $9.1 million of debt issuance costs and $37.4 million
for the purchase of conversion spread hedges.

The
following table represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and
commitments as of December 31, 2007 (see Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements):

(1)

At December 31, 2007 the Company’s
convertible debt is a current liability because the contingent conversion
thresholds on each of the Notes were exceeded. 
As a result, the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder.  See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  Also includes interest
payable on the Notes thru 2008.

(2)

Assumes holders of minority interests put
their shares to us at the earliest possible date based upon the estimated fair
value at December 31, 2007 (see Note 15 for terms of put provisions).


As
more fully discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, after
giving effect to the October 2007 repurchase of priceline.com
International shares, the total minority interest in priceline.com
International on a fully diluted basis is approximately 3.3% at December 31,
2007.  The aggregate fair value of the
minority interest in priceline.com International subject to future puts and
calls is estimated to be approximately $95 million at December 31, 2007, including unvested restricted
stock and restricted stock units.  We
expect the future fair value of the minority interest to grow based upon
expected continued strong performance of the international business.

Based
upon the closing price of our common stock during the measurement periods
provided for by our convertible debt during the three months ended December 31,
2007, the contingent conversion thresholds on each of our convertible senior
note issues were exceeded.  As a result,
all of our outstanding notes (aggregate principal amount $570 million) are
convertible at the option of the holder as of December 31, 2007 and,
accordingly, have been classified as a current liability in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of that date.  While
many factors contribute to the likelihood that the holders of the notes will
elect to convert all or a portion of the notes, as the price of our common
stock increases, the likelihood of conversion also increases.  If holders elect to convert, we would be
required to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash and the conversion
premium in cash or shares of common stock at our option.  We would likely fund the repayment with
existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (totaling
approximately $507.9 million at December 31, 2007), borrowings under our
revolving credit facility, common stock issuances and/or additional borrowings.

In
September 2007, we entered into a $175 million five-year revolving credit
facility with a group of lenders, which is secured, subject to certain
exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our
assets and related intangible assets located in the United States.  In
addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by
substantially all of the assets and related intangible assets of our material
direct and indirect domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  Borrowings under the revolving credit
facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to the
greater of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association’s prime lending
rate and (b) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1%, plus an applicable
margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%; or at an adjusted LIBOR for the
interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin
ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%.  Undrawn
balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to
commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.375%.

The
revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $50 million of
letters of credit as well as borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as
swingline loans, which are available in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling
and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The Company
may request that an additional $100 million be added to the revolving
credit facility or to enter into one or more tranches of additional term loans.
The proceeds of loans made under the facility could be used for working capital
or general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007, there were no
borrowings outstanding under the facility and the Company has issued
approximately $14.7 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit
facility.

We
believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient
to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations
through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or
thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from
operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts
and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital
expenditures and scale back the scope of our


business
plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future
financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised
through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then
current stockholders would be diluted. 
There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from
operations in the future, that revenue growth or sustained profitability will
be realized or that future borrowings or equity sales will be available in
amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our
strategies or repay our indebtedness.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

As
of December 31, 2007, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

Item
7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk

We
manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through
internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate,
through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use an interest rate
swap agreement to manage interest risk and forward contracts to manage foreign
currency risk.

The
objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow
and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in
rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated
near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange
rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators,
discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current
and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to
expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own
investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative
financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market
exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative
instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for
which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for
trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.

We
did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the
year ended December 31, 2007.  Based upon economic conditions and
leading market indicators at December 31, 2007, we do not foresee a
significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future.

As of
December 31, 2007, the carrying value of our debt is approximately $570
million.  We estimate that the fair
market value of such debt was approximately $1.66 billion as of December 31,
2007.

As of December 31, 2007, we held an interest rate swap agreement
on $45 million notional value of our fixed rate debt.  The fair value cost
to terminate this swap as of December 31, 2007 was approximately $0.1
million.  A 10% adverse fluctuation in
the 3-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2007, would increase the cost to
terminate the interest rate swap by approximately $0.1 million.  Any increase or decrease in the fair value of
the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instrument would be
substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value
of the hedged underlying debt.

As a result of the acquisitions of our European and Asian operations,
we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the
United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other then the
U.S. dollar (primarily Euros and British Pounds).  As a result, we face exposure to adverse
movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our
international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars
upon consolidation.  If the
U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these
foreign-currency-denominated balances will


result in increased net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and
net income or loss.  Similarly, our net
assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease
if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally,
foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are
reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.  Our international operations are subject to
risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to,
differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax
structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.

From
time to time, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the
impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated
operating results.  As of December 31,
2007, contracts with notional values of 16.0 million Euros and 3.7 million
British Pounds were outstanding to minimize the impact of short-term foreign
currency fluctuations on consolidated operating results.  As of December 31, 2006, contracts with
notional values of 17.6 million Euros were outstanding.  Foreign exchange gains (losses) from forward
contracts in the amount of ($3.0 million), ($1.5 million) and $0.3 million were
recorded in other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.  We may
enter into additional forward contracts or other economic hedges in the future.

Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains
and losses due to interest rate volatility. 
To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates
affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by
such changes.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and our principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this
evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
end of the period covered by this annual report.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.


Based on our evaluation, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2007. We excluded from our assessment the
internal control over financial reporting at the Agoda Companies, which were
acquired on November 6, 2007 and whose financial statements reflect total
assets and revenues constituting approximately 2% and 1%, respectively, of the
related Consolidated Financial Statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,
2007.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte & Touche LLP,
the independent registered public accounting firm that also audited the Company’s
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007, and issued their related attestation report which is included herein.

Changes in
Internal Controls.

No change in our internal
control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f))
occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

In
November 2007, we acquired the Agoda Companies, and as a result of that
acquisition, we have undertaken a review of their internal controls and intend
to make changes, if necessary, that we believe to be appropriate to those
internal controls as we integrate its business with ours. As we further
integrate Agoda’s business, we will continue to review its internal controls
and may take further steps to ensure that its internal controls are effective
and integrated appropriately.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

priceline.com
Incorporated

Norwalk,
Connecticut

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of priceline.com
Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and
2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2007.  We also
have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  As described in ‘‘Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting’’ management excluded from its
assessment the internal control over financial reporting of the Agoda Companies
which were acquired on November 6, 2007 and whose financial statements
constitute 3% and 2% of net and total assets, respectively, 1% of revenues and
(1%) of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2007. Accordingly, our audit did not
include the internal control over financial reporting at the Agoda Companies.
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”
appearing in Item 9A.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls
may


become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of priceline.com
Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As
discussed in Note 2, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
Statement of Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based
Payment

.

As
discussed in Note 21, the 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements have
been restated.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

— The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries
and its 96.7%-owned subsidiary, priceline.com International Ltd. (“priceline.com
International”), which wholly owns priceline.com Europe Holdings N. V. (“priceline.com
Europe Holdings”), Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V.  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates
in which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise
significant influence, are accounted for by the equity method.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and footnotes thereto.  Actual results
may differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The Company’s
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred merchant
bookings, are carried at cost which approximates their fair value because of
the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  As of December 31, 2007, the estimated
fair value of the Company’s outstanding Convertible Senior Notes was
approximately $1.66 billion.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The Company invests excess
cash primarily in money market accounts and short-term commercial paper. All
highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less are
considered cash equivalents.

Investments

— The Company generally
invests excess cash in short-term investment grade fixed income
securities.  In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” the Company has classified
its investments as available-for-sale. 
These securities are carried at estimated fair market value with the
aggregate unrealized gains and losses related to these investments, net of taxes,
reflected as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income within
stockholders’ equity.

The
fair value of the investments is based on the specific quoted market price of
the securities at the Consolidated Balance Sheet dates.  Investments are considered to be impaired
when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.  Once a decline in fair value is determined to
be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis
in the investment is established. The marketable securities are presented as
current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, if they are
available to meet the short-term working capital needs of the Company.
Investments with a maturity date greater than one year from the balance sheet
date are classified as long-term investments.


Restricted Cash

— Restricted cash at December 31,
2007 and 2006 collateralizes the counterparty to the interest rate hedge
agreement in connection with the Company’s 1% Convertible Senior Notes and
certain landlords that lease the Company office space.

Property and Equipment

— Property and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, when applicable, the life of
the lease, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill

— The Company accounts for
acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of
acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price,
including related transaction costs, over the estimated fair values of the net
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and results of
operations reflect an acquired business starting at the date of the
acquisition.

Goodwill
is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or earlier if there is indication
of impairment, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS 142 also requires the Company to
compare the fair value of the acquired business to its carrying amount on an
annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the
fair value of the acquired business is less than its carrying value, an
impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill
is less than its carrying value. Fair values for acquired businesses are determined
based on discounted cash flows, market multiples or appraised values.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets

— The Company
reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition exceeds its carrying amount. The amount of
impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the
asset over the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount
rate commensurate with the risks involved.

Software Capitalization

— Certain direct development
costs associated with internal-use software are capitalized and include
external direct costs of services and payroll costs for employees devoting time
to the software projects principally related to software coding, designing
system interfaces and installation and testing of the software. These costs are
recorded as fixed assets and are amortized over a period not to exceed three
years beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use. Costs incurred
during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training
costs, are expensed as incurred.

Merchant
Revenues and Cost of Merchant Revenues

Name Your
Own Price

®

Services

: 
Merchant revenues and related cost of revenues are derived from
transactions where priceline.com is the merchant of record and, among other
things, selects suppliers and determines the price it will accept from the
customer.  The Company recognizes such
revenues and costs if and when it fulfills the customer’s non-refundable offer.
Merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and
cost, respectively, of the travel services and are reported on a gross
basis.  In very limited circumstances,
priceline.com makes certain customer accommodations to satisfy disputes and
complaints.  The Company accrues for such
estimated losses and classifies the resulting expense as adjustments to
merchant revenue and cost of merchant revenues.

Pursuant to the
terms of the Company’s hotel service, its hotel suppliers are permitted to bill
the Company for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of
time.  In the event that the Company is
not billed by its hotel supplier within the specified time period, the Company
reduces its cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts.


Merchant
Price-Disclosed Hotel Service

:  Merchant revenues for the Company’s

merchant
price-disclosed

hotel service are derived from transactions where
its customers purchase hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at disclosed rates
which are subject to contractual arrangements. 
Charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are included
in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer completes his or her stay.
Such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay, subject
to cancellation penalties in certain cases. Merchant revenues and accounts
payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s
stay at the hotel. The Company records the difference between the selling price
and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue.

Agency Revenues and Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where the
Company is not the merchant of record and where the prices of the services sold
are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions,
customer processing fees and global distribution system (“GDS”) reservation
booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any
associated cost of revenue. Such revenues are recognized by the Company when
the customers complete their travel.

Stock-Based Compensation

— In December 2004,
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (Revised 2004),
Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123(R)”) was issued. SFAS 123(R) is a revision
of SFAS No. 123, as amended, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (“SFAS
123”). SFAS 123(R) eliminated the alternative to use the intrinsic value
method of accounting that was provided in SFAS 123, which generally resulted in
no compensation expense recorded in the financial statements related to the
issuance of stock options. SFAS 123(R) requires that the cost resulting
from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial
statements. SFAS 123(R) established fair value as the measurement
objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires
companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for
share-based payment transactions with employees.  Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company
accounted for stock awards and stock option grants using the intrinsic value
method. Compensation expense relating to restricted stock and restricted stock


unit
grants was recognized over the period during which the employee rendered
service to the Company necessary to earn the award, at fair value on date of
grant.

Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified
prospective method. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized
in the year ended December 31, 2006, includes amounts of: (a) compensation
cost of all share-based awards granted to employees prior to, but unvested as
of, January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, net of estimated
forfeitures, and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based awards granted
subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the new provisions of SFAS 123(R). In accordance
with the modified prospective method, results for prior periods have not been
restated.   The Company determined the
excess tax benefits available as of the adoption date for use in offsetting
future tax shortfalls using the alternative transition method of FASB Staff
Position 123(R)-3. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in an increase in
net earnings attributable to the cumulative effect of this accounting change
caused by SFAS 123(R)’s requirement to apply an estimated forfeiture rate to
unvested awards.  The Company previously
recorded forfeitures when they occurred. The cumulative effect of accounting
change as of January 1, 2006 totaled approximately $211,000 ($131,000 net
of related tax effect) and was recorded in personnel expense for the year ended
December 31, 2006 since its impact on net income and net income per share
was not significant. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), deferred
compensation related to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards was
classified as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. In accordance with
the provisions of SFAS 123(R), on January 1, 2006, the balance in deferred
compensation was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.

The
fair value of restricted stock, performance share units and restricted stock
units is determined based on the number of units or shares, as applicable,
granted and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock as of the grant
date.  The fair value of stock options is
determined as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Such
value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated
forfeitures, using the straight line method under SFAS 123(R).

SFAS
123(R) also amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, requiring
the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be
reported as financing cash flows, rather than as operating cash flows as
previously required, but only when such excess tax benefits are realized.

The
fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31,
2005 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, assuming no dividends and the following weighted average assumptions:

The
risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S Treasury yield curve in effect at
the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the
option.  The expected lives represent the
weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the Company’s
historical exercise pattern.  The
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common
stock.

The
following table provides relevant information as to reported results for the
year ended December 31, 2005 under the Company’s intrinsic value method of
accounting for stock options with


supplemental
pro forma information as if the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123
had been applied (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Income Taxes

— The Company accounts for
income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities
and assets are determined based on the temporary difference between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently
enacted tax rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

Segment Reporting

— The Company operates and
manages its business as a single operating segment.  For geographic related information, see Note
19 to these Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional currency of
the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is generally their respective local
currency.  Assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange existing at the balance
sheet date.  Income statement amounts are
translated at the average exchange rates for the period.  Translation gains and losses are included as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Foreign
currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations, principally in other income (expense), and amounted to
($0.2 million), $0.8 million and ($0.7 million) for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— The Company
recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value.  The Company uses derivative instruments
principally in the management of interest rate and foreign currency exposure.
On the date on which the Company enters into a derivative transaction, the
derivative is designated as a hedge of the identified exposure. The Company
formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged
items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking
the hedge transaction. In this documentation, the Company specifically
identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or
net investment that has been designated as the hedged item and states how the
hedging instrument is expected to reduce the risks related to the hedged item.
The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis.  The
Company’s derivative instruments do not contain leverage features. Gains and
losses on a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses on
a derivative designated as a fair value hedge are offset by the loss or gain of
the hedged item.   Hedge ineffectiveness
is recorded in the statement of operations as incurred.


From
time to time, the Company enters into forward contracts with counterparties
pursuant to which future foreign exchange rates for expected future earnings
are fixed.  Realized and unrealized gains
and losses resulting from the forward contracts are recognized in the period in
which they occur.  As of December 31,
2007, contracts with notional values of 16.0 million Euros and 3.7 million
British Pounds were outstanding to minimize the impact of short-term foreign
currency fluctuations on consolidated operating results.  As of December 31, 2006, contracts with
notional amounts of 17.6 million Euros were outstanding.  Foreign exchange gains (losses) from forward
contracts in the amount of ($3.0 million), ($1.5 million) and $0.3 million were
recorded in other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

— In September 2006,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157,
Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The standard requires
unrealized gains and losses to be included in earnings for items reported using
the fair value option.  SFAS No. 159
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We
do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141(R)”). SFAS No. 141(R) requires
an entity to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual
contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the
acquisition date. It also requires acquisition-related costs to be expensed as
incurred, restructuring costs to generally be expensed in periods subsequent to
the acquisition date, and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset
valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the
measurement period impact income tax expense. The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will
change the Company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on a
prospective basis beginning January 1, 2009.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS No. 160”).
SFAS No. 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority
interests, which will be characterized as non-controlling interests and
classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for
the Company on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
The Company has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial
statements of adopting SFAS No. 160.

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

On November 6, 2007,
the Company and a newly-formed, indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, acquired 100% of the total issued share capital of  Agoda Company, Ltd. (“Agoda”) and AGIP LLC (“AGIP,”
and together with Agoda, the “Agoda Companies”).  The purchase price for
the acquisition, including acquisition costs, consists of an initial purchase
price payable by the Company in cash of approximately $16 million and up to an
additional $141.6 million

in cash,
which is payable by the Company if the Agoda Companies achieve the maximum “gross
bookings” and earnings targets from January 1, 2008 through December 31,
2010.  The contingent consideration, if any, will be recorded as
additional purchase price when the contingency is resolved and additional
purchase price, if any, is distributable. Assets acquired totaled $13.7 million
and consisted principally of cash, accounts receivable and intangible
assets.  Liabilities assumed totaled
approximately $13.1 million and consisted of accounts payable, accrued
expenses, deferred merchant bookings and deferred taxes.  Preliminary goodwill resulting from the
acquisition amounted to approximately $15.7 million and is subject to
adjustment upon


finalization of the purchase price
allocation.

On December 21, 2007,
the Company acquired 100% of the total issued share capital of an online advertising
company for approximately $4.1 million in cash, including acquisition
costs.  Assets acquired totaled $2.6
million and consisted principally of cash, accounts receivable and intangible
assets.  Liabilities assumed totaled
approximately $0.6 million and consisted of accounts payable, accrued expenses,
and deferred taxes.  Preliminary goodwill
resulting from the acquisition amounted to approximately $2.1 million and is
subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation.  In addition, the Company could be required to
pay an additional amount of up to $3.8 million in each of the years 2008, 2009
and 2010, if the acquired company achieves certain performance targets.

The acquisitions have been
accounted for as purchase business combinations. The Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements include the results of operations of the acquired
companies since their respective acquisitions.

4.             STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

The
Company has adopted the following stock compensation plans from which
broad-based employee grants may be made:  the priceline.com Incorporated
1997 Omnibus Plan (the “1997 Plan”), the priceline.com Incorporated 1999
Omnibus Plan (the “1999 Plan”) and the priceline.com Incorporated 2000 Employee
Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”), each of which provides for grants of
share-based compensation as incentives and rewards to encourage employees,
officers, consultants and directors in the long-term success of the
Company.  The 1997 Plan, 1999 Plan and
2000 Plan provide for grants of share-based compensation to purchase up to
3,979,166, 7,895,833 and 1,000,000 shares of priceline.com common stock,
respectively, at a purchase price equal to the fair market value on the date of
grant.

Stock-based
compensation issued under the plans generally consists of non-qualified stock
options, restricted stock, performance share units and restricted stock
units.  Stock options are granted to
employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the common stock
at the date of grant and have a term of 10 years.  Generally, stock option grants to employees
vest over three years from the grant date. 
Restricted stock, performance share units and restricted stock units
generally vest over periods from 1 to 4 years. 
The Company issues new shares of common stock upon the issuance of
restricted stock, the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted
stock units and performance share units.

In
addition, the Company has granted restricted stock and restricted stock units
in shares of priceline.com International to certain managers of its European
operations.  These awards generally vest
over two to three years.

Stock-based
compensation cost was approximately $16.3 million, $14.9 million and $4.2
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  The related tax benefit
was $5.3 million, $5.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
Included in the above amounts are stock-based compensation and related
tax benefit for restricted stock and restricted stock units related to shares
of priceline.com International (“PIL Share-Based Awards”).


The
following table summarizes stock option activity during the year ended December 31,
2007:

The
Company granted 371,998 stock options during the year ended December 31,
2005, with a weighted average grant-date fair value per share of $11.32.  No stock options were granted during the year
ended December 31, 2006.  The
intrinsic value of stock options exercised was approximately $12.6 million and
$4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  As of December 31,
2007, the total future compensation cost related to unvested stock options not
yet recognized was $0.6 million and the weighted average period over which
these awards are expected to be recognized was 0.6 years.

The
following table summarizes the activity of unvested restricted stock,
restricted stock units and performance share units (“Share-Based Awards”)
during the year ended December 31, 2007:

The
Company granted 322,620 and 389,977 restricted shares, performance share units
and restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively, with an aggregate grant-date fair value of approximately
$8.1 million and $8.8 million, respectively. 
During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
157,542 and 26,833 shares of restricted stock vested with a total grant date
fair value of $3.5 million and $0.6 million.

As
of December 31, 2007, there was $70.5 million of total future compensation
cost related to unvested Share-Based Awards to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2.7 years.

The
unvested Share-Based Awards include 276,110 performance share units granted in
2007 to certain employees, net of actual forfeitures, with a weighted average
grant date fair value of


approximately
$96.73 per share.  The 276,110 represents the target number of performance
share units of priceline.com common stock that will be issued to employees if
the Company, and, with respect to certain grants, its subsidiaries,
priceline.com International and the Agoda Companies, achieve certain financial
performance goals.  The actual number of shares issued will be determined
in 2011 upon completion of the performance period, assuming there is no
accelerated vesting for, among other things, a termination of employment under
certain circumstances, or a change in control, and could range from 99,360 to
an additional 496,986 shares over the target number of shares if the maximum
performance threshold associated with the performance share units is met by the
Company and/or its subsidiaries, as applicable. 
Stock-based compensation related to the performance share units is
recorded based upon the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance
period.  During the year ended December 31,
2007, the estimated probable number of shares to be issued at the end of the
performance period was increased by 381,440 shares.

The
unvested Share-Based Awards include a broad-based grant of 164,095 performance
share units to certain employees in 2006, net of actual forfeitures, with a
weighted average grant date fair value of approximately $25.39 per share. 
The 164,095 represents the target number of shares of priceline.com common
stock that will be issued to employees if the Company achieves certain
financial performance versus a peer group of companies.  The actual number
of share units issued will be determined in 2009 upon completion of the
performance period, assuming there is no accelerated vesting for, among other
things, a change in control, and could range from zero to an additional 328,190
shares over the target number of shares if the maximum performance threshold
associated with the performance share units is met by the Company.
 Stock-based compensation related to the performance share units is
recorded based upon the estimated probable outcome at the end of the
performance period.  During the year
ended December 31, 2006, the estimated probable number of shares to be
issued at the end of the performance period was increased by 328,190 shares.

The
following table summarizes the activity of unvested PIL Share-Based Awards
during the year ended December 31, 2007 (based upon the exchange rate as
of December 31, 2007):

The
Company granted 57,515 restricted shares and restricted stock units of
priceline.com International during the year ended December 31, 2005, with
an aggregate grant-date fair value of $1.8 million (based upon the exchange
rate at grant date).  No shares were
issued during the year ended December 31, 2006.  During the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005, 23,382 and 24,958 shares of priceline.com International restricted
stock vested with a total grant date fair value of approximately $0.8 million
and $0.8 million, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2007 there was $0.1 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested PIL Share-Based Awards (based upon the
exchange rate as of December 31, 2007) to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 0.1 years.

RESTRUCTURING

At
December 31, 2007, the Company had a restructuring liability of $1.2
million for the estimated remaining costs related to leased property vacated by
the Company in 2000. During the first quarter of


2006,
the Company recorded a $0.1 million restructuring charge based upon a
re-evaluation of the estimated disposal costs related to the vacated leased
property.  The Company estimates that,
based on current available information, the remaining net cash outflows associated
with its restructuring related commitments will be paid in 2008-2011. The
current portion of the restructuring accrual in the amount of $0.7 million is
recorded in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” and the $0.5
million non-current portion is recorded in “Other long-term liabilities” on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Company also records a provision for uncollectible commissions.  Changes in accounts receivable reserves
consisted of the following (in thousands):


8.             NET INCOME PER SHARE

The
Company computes basic and diluted net income per share in accordance with SFAS
No. 128, “Earnings per Share.” Basic net income per share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period.

Common
equivalent shares related to stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, performance share units and warrants are calculated using the treasury
stock method. Performance share units are included in the weighted average
common equivalent shares based on the number of shares that would be issued if
the end of the reporting period were the end of the performance period, if the
result would be dilutive. The warrants underlying Series B Preferred Stock
were considered for inclusion in fully diluted net income per share using the “if-converted”
method.

The
Company’s convertible debt issues have net share settlement features requiring
the Company upon conversion to settle the principal amount of the debt for cash
and the conversion premium for cash or shares of the Company’s common stock.
Pursuant to EITF 90-19, “Convertible Bonds with Issuer Options to Settle for
Cash upon Conversion,” the convertible notes are included in the calculation of
diluted net income per share if their inclusion is dilutive under the treasury
stock method.

Prior
to the Company executing an exchange offer in November 2006 that modified
certain terms in the 1% Notes and 2.25% Notes, such notes were convertible into
a fixed amount of common stock if certain specified conditions were met.
Pursuant to EITF 04-08 “Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted
Earnings per Share”, these convertible notes were included in the calculation
of diluted earnings per share if their inclusion was dilutive to earnings per
share under the “if-converted” method for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005.

A
reconciliation of net income and the weighted average number of shares
outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per share is as follows (in
thousands):


Anti-dilutive
potential common shares for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006
includes approximately 7.9 million shares and 9.3 million shares, respectively,
that could be issued under the Company’s convertible debt if the Company
experiences substantial increases in its common stock price. Under the treasury
stock method, the convertible notes will generally have a dilutive impact on
net income per share if the Company’s average stock price for the period
exceeds the conversion price for the convertible notes. As an example, at stock
prices of $40 per share, $80 per share, $100 per share and $150 per share,
common equivalent shares would include approximately 0.1 million, 7.2 million,
8.6 million and 10.5 million equivalent shares, respectively, related to the
convertible notes (excluding the offsetting impact of the Convertible Spread
Hedges — see Note 12).

9.             PROPERTY

OTHER ASSETS

Other assets at December 31,
2007 and 2006 consist of the following (in thousands):

Investment in pricelinemortgage.com represents the Company’s 49% equity
investment in pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, the Company recognizes
its pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating results, not to exceed
an amount that the Company believes represents the investment’s estimated fair
value. The Company recognized losses of approximately $321,000 and $80,000
representing its pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating loss for
the years ended


December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2005,
the Company recognized approximately $1.3 million of income from its investment
in pricelinemortgage.com.  The Company
earned advertising fees from pricelinemortgage.com of approximately $9,000,
$22,000 and $53,000 in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  In 2006, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million to reduce the carrying value of
its equity investment in pricelinemortgage.com to its estimated fair value.

Deferred debt issuance costs arose from the Company’s issuance of $125
million aggregate principal amount of 1% Notes in August 2003, $100
million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Notes in June 2004, $172.5
million aggregate principal amount of 0.5% Notes in September 2006 and
$172.5 million of aggregate principal amount 0.75% Notes in September 2006
(see Note 12).  Deferred debt issuance
costs of approximately $4.3 million, $3.8 million, $4.4 million and $4.4
million, respectively, consisting primarily of underwriting commissions and
professional service fees, are being amortized using the effective interest
rate method over approximately five years, except for the 0.75% Notes, which
are amortized over seven years.

12.           DEBT

Revolving Credit Facility

In
September 2007, the Company entered into a $175 million five-year
revolving credit facility with a group of lenders, which is secured, subject to
certain exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all
of the Company’s assets and related intangible assets located in the United
States. In addition, the Company’s obligations under the revolving credit
facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the assets and related
intangible assets of the Company’s material direct and indirect domestic and
foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear
interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association’s prime lending rate and (b) the federal
funds rate plus ½ of 1%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%;
or at an adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such
borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. Undrawn
balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment
fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.375%.

The
revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $50 million of
letters of credit as well as borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as
swingline loans, which are available in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling
and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The Company
may request that an additional $100 million be added to the revolving
credit facility or to enter into one or more tranches of additional term loans.
The proceeds of loans made under the facility could be used for working capital
or general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007, there were no
borrowings outstanding under the facility and the Company has issued
approximately $14.7 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit
facility.

Convertible Debt

The
Company’s convertible debt is convertible into the Company’s common stock
subject to certain conditions. Upon conversion, a holder will receive cash for
the principal amount of the note and cash or shares of the Company’s common
stock for the conversion value in excess of such principal amount.  Based
upon the closing price of the Company’s common stock for the prescribed
measurement periods during the three months ended December 31, 2007, the
contingent conversion thresholds on each of the Company’s convertible senior
note issues were exceeded. As a result, the notes are convertible at the option
of the holder as of December 31, 2007 and, accordingly, have been
classified as a current liability amounting to approximately $570 million in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. 
As of December 31, 2007, the estimated fair value of the
Convertible Senior Notes was approximately $1.66 billion.  If the note holders were to convert, the
Company would deliver approximately $570 million in cash to repay the principal
amount of the notes and would deliver cash or shares of common stock, at its


option, to satisfy the
conversion value in excess of the principal amount.  In 2007, approximately $50,000 and $23,000 of
the 2.25% Notes and 1% Notes, respectively, were converted.  The convertible debt may be classified
as long-term debt in future quarters if the contingent conversion thresholds
are not met in such quarters. Convertible debt consists of the following as of December 31,
2007 and 2006 (in thousands):

The
$125 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due August 1,
2010, with an interest rate of 1.00% (the “1% Notes”) are convertible, subject
to certain conditions, into the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of
approximately $40.00 per share. Prior to August 1, 2008, the 1% Notes will
be convertible if the closing price of the Company’s common stock for at least
20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the first day of a
conversion period is more than 110% of the then current conversion price of the
1% Notes, or after August 1, 2008, if the closing price of the Company’s
common stock is more than 110% of the then current conversion price of the 1%
Notes. The 1% Notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances, such
as a change in control of the Company. In addition, the 1% Notes will be
redeemable at the Company’s option beginning in 2008, and the holders
may require the Company to repurchase the 1% Notes on August 1, 2008
or in certain other circumstances. In the event that all or substantially all
of the Company’s common stock is acquired on or prior to August 1, 2008,
in a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of the Company’s
common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the Company would be
required to make additional payments in the form of additional shares of
common stock to the holders of 1% Notes in aggregate value ranging from $0 to
approximately $16.5 million depending upon the date of the transaction and the
then current stock price of the Company. No additional payments are due at
stock prices in excess of $100 per share. 
Interest on the 1% Notes is payable on February 1 and August 1
of each year.

In
November 2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
whereby it swapped the fixed 1% interest on its 1% Notes for a floating
interest rate based on the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable
margin of 221 basis points, on $45 million notional value of debt. This
agreement expires August 1, 2010. The Company designated this interest
rate swap agreement as a fair value hedge. The changes in the fair value of the
interest rate swap agreement and the underlying debt are recorded as offsetting
gains and losses in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Hedge ineffectiveness was not significant in the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005. The fair value cost to terminate this swap as of December 31,
2007 and 2006, was approximately $0.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively,
and has been recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities at December 31,
2007, and other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2006, with a related
adjustment to the carrying value of debt.

In
2006, the Company issued in a private placement $172.5 million aggregate
principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due September 30, 2011, with
an interest rate of 0.50% (the “2011 Notes”), and $172.5 million aggregate
principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due September 30, 2013, with
an interest rate of 0.75% (the “2013 Notes”). 
The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes are convertible, subject


to certain conditions, into
the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of approximately $40.38 per
share. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes are convertible, at the option of the
holder, prior to June 30, 2011 in the case of the 2011 Notes, and prior to
June 30, 2013 in the case of the 2013 Notes, upon the occurrence of
specified events, including, but not limited to a change in control, or if the
closing sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days
in the period of the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day
of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 120% of the
applicable conversion price in effect for the notes on the last trading day of
the immediately preceding quarter. In the event that all or substantially all
of the Company’s common stock is acquired on or prior to the maturity of the
2011 Notes or the 2013 Notes, in a transaction in which the consideration paid
to holders of the Company’s common stock consists of all or substantially all
cash, the Company would be required to make additional payments in the
form of additional shares of common stock to the holders of the 2011 Notes
and the 2013 Notes, collectively, in aggregate value ranging from $0 to
approximately $57.5 million depending upon the date of the transaction and the
then current stock price of the Company.  No additional payments are due
at stock prices in excess of $100 per share. 
As of June 30, 2011, with respect to the 2011 Notes, and as of June 30,
2013, with respect to the 2013 Notes, holders shall have the right to convert
all or any portion of such security. Neither the 2011 Notes nor the 2013 Notes
may be redeemed by the Company prior to maturity. The holders
may require the Company to repurchase the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes
for cash in certain circumstances. Interest on the 2011 Notes and the 2013
Notes is payable on March 30 and September 30 of each year, starting March 30,
2007.

The
Company entered into hedge transactions relating to potential dilution of the
Company’s common stock upon conversion of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes
(the “Conversion Spread Hedges”). Under the Conversion Spread Hedges, the
Company is entitled to purchase from the counterparties approximately 8.5
million shares of the Company’s common stock (the number of shares underlying
the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes) at a strike price of $40.38 per share
(subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) and the counterparties are
entitled to purchase from the Company approximately 8.5 million shares of the
Company’s common stock at a strike price of $50.47 per share (subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances).  The Conversion Spread Hedges
increase the effective conversion price of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes to
$50.47 per share from the Company’s perspective and are designed to reduce the
potential dilution upon conversion of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. If the
market value per share of the Company’s common stock at the time of any
exercise is above $40.38, the Conversion Spread Hedge will entitle the Company
to receive from the counterparties net shares of the Company’s common stock
based on the excess of the then current market price of the Company’s common
stock over the strike price of the purchased call options. Holders of the 2011
Notes and the 2013 Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Conversion
Spread Hedges. The Conversion Spread Hedges are separate transactions entered
into by the Company with the counterparties, are not part of the terms of
the Notes and will not affect the holders’ rights under the 2011 Notes and the
2013 Notes. The Conversion Spread Hedges are exercisable at dates coinciding
with the scheduled maturities of the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes.

The
Company analyzed the Conversion Spread Hedges under Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled In, a Company’s Own Stock,” and EITF 01-6, “The
Meaning of Indexed to a Company’s Own Stock” and determined that they meet the
criteria for classification as equity transactions. As a result, in the year
ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded the $37.4 million paid to
purchase Conversion Spread Hedges as a reduction in additional paid-in capital
and the Company will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the
agreements.

The
$100 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due January 15,
2025, with an interest rate of 2.25% (the “2.25% Notes”) are convertible,
subject to certain conditions, into the Company’s common stock at a conversion
price of approximately $37.95 per share. The 2.25% Notes will be convertible
if, on or prior to January 15, 2020, the closing sale price of our common
stock for at least 20 consecutive trading days in the period of 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the first day of a


conversion
period is more than 120% of the then current conversion price of the 2.25%
Notes. The 2.25% Notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances,
such as a change in control of the Company. In the event that all or
substantially all of the Company’s common stock is acquired on or prior to January 15,
2010, in a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of the
Company’s common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the Company
would be required to make additional payments in the form of common shares
to the holders of the 2.25% Notes of amounts ranging from $0 to $14.3 million
depending upon the date of the transaction and the then current stock price of
the Company. Based on the stock price at December 31, 2007, the Company
would be required to make $0.6 million in additional payments.  In addition, the 2.25% Notes will be
redeemable at the Company’s option beginning January 20, 2010, and the
holders may require the Company to repurchase the 2.25% Notes on January 15,
2010, 2015 or 2020, or in certain other circumstances. Interest on the 2.25%
Notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year.

The Company used a portion
of the net proceeds from the issuance of its convertible debt to purchase the
Conversion Spread Hedges and to repurchase 3.85 million shares of its common
stock at a cost of $129.6 million.  The
Company also used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuances to fund the
acquisitions of Travelweb and Booking.com Limited in 2004, Booking.com B.V. in July 2005
and the Agoda Companies in 2007.  The
remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, strategic uses
and working capital requirements.

13.           TREASURY STOCK

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock from time to time
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In addition, in the
third quarter 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to an additional $150 million of the Company’s common stock with a
portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes.
The Company’s Board of Directors has also given the Company the general
authorization to repurchase shares of its common stock to satisfy employee
withholding tax obligations related to stock-based compensation.

Under
these programs, the Company repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares of its
common stock at an aggregate cost of $134.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2006, at prevailing market prices. Repurchases of 43,358 and 40,496 shares at
an aggregate cost of approximately $2.6 million and $1.1 million were made in
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to satisfy
employee withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation.

The
Company may make additional repurchases of shares under its stock
repurchase program, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses
of capital and other factors. Whether and when to initiate and/or complete any
purchase of common stock and the amount of common stock purchased will be
determined in the Company’s complete discretion. As of December 31, 2007,
there were approximately 6.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock held
in treasury.

14.           REDEEMABLE PREFERRED
STOCK

There
were 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31,
2006, with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $13.5 million
and a semi-annual dividend requirement of 40,240 shares of common stock.  In the first quarter of 2007, Delta exercised
warrants to purchase 756,199 shares of the Company’s common stock by
surrendering 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, representing all
of the remaining outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and the
Company issued a final pro-rated dividend to Delta in the amount of 34,874
shares of common stock. The exercise of the warrant was a non-cash
transaction.  The Company recorded non-cash
dividends of approximately $1.6 million, $1.9 million and $1.9 million for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


15.

MINORITY
INTERESTS

In
connection with the Company’s acquisitions of Booking.com B.V. in July 2005
and Booking.com Limited in September 2004 and the reorganization of its
European operations, key managers of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited
purchased shares of priceline.com International.  In addition, these key managers were granted
restricted stock and restricted stock units in priceline.com International
shares that vest over time.  As of December 31, 2007, the total
aggregate minority interest in priceline.com International on a fully diluted
basis was approximately 3.30%.

The
holders of the minority interest in priceline.com International have the right
to put their shares to the Company and the Company has the right to call their
shares at a purchase price reflecting the fair market value of the shares at
the time of the exercise of the put or call right.  Subject to certain
exceptions, (a) certain of the shares are subject to the put and call
options in March 2008 and (b) certain of the shares are subject to
the put and call options in August 2008.  In April 2007 (in
connection with the March 2007 put and call options), the Company
repurchased 92,125 shares underlying minority interest with a carrying value of
$3.7 million for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $15.0 million
based upon fair value.  In October 2007 (in connection with the August 2007
put and call options), the Company repurchased 197,538 shares underlying
minority with a carrying value of $9.9 million for an aggregate purchase price
of approximately $61.0 million based upon fair value.  In 2006, the
Company repurchased shares underlying minority interest with a carrying value
of $7.9 million for an aggregate purchase price of $19.8 million based upon
fair value.  The purchases have been accounted for as step acquisitions
and accordingly, the excess of the purchase price over the carrying value is
recorded as an increase of intangible assets, deferred taxes and goodwill.

All purchased securities and vested granted securities described above
can be put by the holders of the securities or called by the Company shortly
after the consummation of a “change in control” of the Company.  The
aggregate fair value of the remaining minority interest in priceline.com
International is estimated to be approximately $95 million and $63 million at December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively, including unvested restricted stock and restricted
stock units.

TAXES

Domestic pre-tax income was
$25.9 million, $27.6 million and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
Foreign pre-tax income was $119.1 million, $34.5 million and $5.1
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

The tax provision (benefit) for
the year ended December 31, 2007 is as follows (in thousands):

The tax provision (benefit) for
the year ended December 31, 2006 is as follows (in thousands):


The
tax provision (benefit)

for the year ended

December 31, 2005 is
as follows (in thousands):

At
December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $3.0 billion of net
operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes expiring
from December 31, 2019 to 2021.  The
utilization of these NOL’s is subject to limitation under Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code and is also dependent upon the Company’s ability to
generate sufficient future income.

Section 382
imposes limitations on the availability of a company’s net operating losses
after a more than 50 percentage point ownership change occurs.  The Section 382 limitation is based upon
certain conclusions pertaining to the dates of ownership changes and the value
of the Company on the dates of the ownership changes.  As a result of a study, it was determined
that ownership changes, as defined in Section 382, occurred in 2000 and
2002.  The amount of the Company’s net
operating losses incurred prior to each ownership change is limited based on
the value of the Company on the respective dates of ownership change.  It is estimated that the effect of Section 382
will generally limit the total cumulative amount of net operating loss
available to offset future taxable income to approximately $1.6 billion.  Pursuant to Section 382, subsequent
ownership changes could further limit this amount.

As required by SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” the Company periodically evaluates the
likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying
amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it
believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers many factors
when assessing the likelihood of future realization of the deferred tax assets,
including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction,
expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax
reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Based upon such assessments, in
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded
non-cash income tax benefits in the amount of $47.9 million, $28.1 million and
$170.5 million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of its
valuation allowance on its domestic deferred tax assets.  In addition, the
Company recognized $3.6 million of deferred tax assets in 2007 related to
foreign capital allowance deductions that are considered more likely than not
to be realized. The deferred tax asset at December 31, 2007 and 2006
amounted to $232.6 million and $191.7 million, respectively.  The current portion at December 31, 2007
and 2006 amounting to $14.0 million and $12.3 million, respectively, is
recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.  It is more likely than
not that the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized and,
accordingly, a valuation allowance remains against those assets.  The
valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and
circumstances change, causing a reassessment of the amount of deferred tax
assets more likely than not to be realized.

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of
deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as
follows (in thousands):


The
Company has recorded a deferred tax liability in the amount of $46.5 million
and $39.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily
related to the assignment of estimated fair value to certain purchased identifiable
intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of Booking.com Limited,
Booking.com B.V. and Agoda Company, Ltd. 
Income tax benefits in the amount of $1.3 million and $3.0 million,
respectively, were recorded in 2007 and 2006 resulting from the impact on
deferred taxes of enacted reductions in certain foreign statutory tax
rates.  At December 31, 2007, no
provision had been made for U.S. taxes on approximately $108.6 million of
foreign earnings that are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.  Estimating the tax liability that would arise
if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable at this time.

The
valuation allowance decreased by approximately $62 million and $38 million for
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, resulting primarily from a
reversal of a portion of its valuation allowance to adjust the estimated amount
of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized.

At
December 31, 2007, the Company has approximately $660 million of state net
operating loss carryfowards that expire between 2021 and 2023, approximately
$97 million of U.K. net operating loss carryforwards and $10 million of U.K.
capital allowance carryforwards that do not expire.  At December 31, 2006, the Company had
approximately $5 million of U.S. capital loss carryforwards, which expired in
2007.  At December 31, 2007, the
Company also had approximately $1.4 million of U.S. research credit
carryforwards that expire from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020
and are also subject to annual limitation.

Approximately $1.9 billion of the federal NOL tax benefits were
generated through equity-related transactions, including equity-based
compensation and stock warrants and would be a recorded as an increase to
additional paid-in capital if subsequently utilized.

The effective income tax rate of the Company is
different from the amount computed using the expected U.S. statutory federal
rate of 35% as a result of the following items (in thousands):


In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
“Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 applies to all tax positions
and clarifies the recognition of tax benefits in the financial statements by
providing for a two-step approach of recognition and measurement. The first
step involves assessing whether the tax position is more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination based upon its technical merits. The second step
involves measurement of the amount to recognize. Tax positions that meet the
more likely than not threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate
finalization with the taxing authority. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations and financial position.

The Company’s U.K.,
Netherlands, U.S. Federal and Connecticut income tax returns, constituting the
returns of the major taxing jurisdictions, are subject to examination by the
taxing authorities for all open years as prescribed by applicable statute. No income
tax waivers have been executed that would extend the period subject to
examination beyond the period prescribed by statute.

COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES

Litigation Related to Hotel
Occupancy and Other Taxes

Statewide
Putative Class Actions

A
number of cities and counties have filed putative class actions on behalf of
themselves and other allegedly similarly situated cities and counties within
the same respective state against the Company and other defendants, including,
but not in all cases, Lowestfare.com Incorporated and Travelweb LLC, both of
which are subsidiaries of the Company, and Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotels.com GP,
LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets, Inc.; Travelport, Inc. (f/k/a
Cendant Travel Distribution Services Group, Inc.); Expedia, Inc.;
Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a Lodging.com); Maupintour Holding LLC;
Orbitz, Inc.; Orbitz, LLC; Site59.com, LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.;
Travelocity.com LP; and Travelnow.com, Inc.  Each complaint alleges, among other things,
that the defendants violated each jurisdiction’s respective hotel occupancy tax
ordinance with respect to the charges and remittance of amounts to cover taxes
under each ordinance.  Each complaint
typically seeks compensatory damages, disgorgement, penalties available by law,
attorneys’ fees and other relief.  Such
actions include:

City
of Los Angeles v. Hotels.com, Inc., et al.

:  On December 30, 2004, a putative class
action complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles
by the City of Los Angeles on behalf of itself and an alleged class of
California cities, counties and other municipalities that have enacted
occupancy taxes.  In addition to the tax
claims, the complaint also asserts unfair competition claims under California
Business and Professions Code § 17200,

et seq.

(“Section 17200”).  On August 31, 2005, the City of Los
Angeles filed an amended complaint adding a claim for a declaratory
judgment.  On September 26, 2005, the
court sustained the defendants’ demurrers on grounds of improper joinder of
defendants and claims, and therefore, dismissed the amended complaint, with
leave to file a second amended complaint. 
On February 8, 2006, the City of Los Angeles filed a second amended
complaint that asserts the same claims but includes additional allegations of

Sports Authority as a plaintiff.  On October 15,
2007, the Company and the other defendants filed renewed special exceptions to
the complaint and affirmative defenses. 
On November 19, 2007, the court granted those special
exceptions.  On January 22, 2008,
the plaintiffs filed a second amended petition. 
On February 4, 2008, the Company and the defendants filed renewed
special exceptions to the petition and moved to dismiss the action.  The special exceptions and motion are
pending.

City of Oakland, California
v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On June 29,
2007, the City of Oakland, California filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California.  In addition to the claim for violation of the
City of Oakland’s Transient Tax Ordinance, the complaint also asserted unfair
competition claims under California Business and Professions Code § 17200,

et seq.

, and claims for conversion, unjust enrichment,
punitive damages, a constructive trust and a declaratory judgment.  On September 18, 2007, the defendants
moved to dismiss the complaint.  On November 6,
2007, the court granted the defendants’ motion and dismissed the City of
Oakland’s complaint with prejudice for the City’s failure to exhaust its
mandatory administrative procedures for tax collection.  On December 5, 2007, the City of Oakland
filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.  That appeal is being briefed.

et al.

:  On November 30, 2007,
the City of Madison filed a declaratory judgment complaint in the Circuit Court
for Dane County, Wisconsin seeking a declaration that the defendants are
subject to the Madison hotel occupancy tax. 
On January 23, 2008, the Company and the other defendants moved to
dismiss the City of Madison’s declaratory judgment complaint on the basis that
the City failed to exhaust its mandatory administrative remedies before filing
suit.  That motion is pending.

Mecklenburg County v.
Hotels.com LP, et al.

:  On January 14,
2008, Mecklenburg County filed a complaint in the General Court of Justice,
Superior Court Division, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  In addition to the claim for room occupancy
taxes, the complaint also asserted claims for a declaratory judgment, an
injunction, conversion, imposition of a constructive trust, an accounting,
violation of North Carolina General Statute § 75-1, et seq., and breach of
agency duties and statutory penalties. 
At the time it filed the complaint, Mecklenburg also moved to designate
the case as a complex business case subject to the jurisdiction of the North
Carolina Business Court.  The Company and
its subsidiaries accepted


service
of the complaint and are presently scheduled to move to dismiss, answer or
otherwise respond to the complaint on or before March 24, 2008.  On February 19, 2008, this action was
consolidated with

Wake County

, which is discussed
in further detail above.

We have also been informed by
counsel to the plaintiffs in certain of the aforementioned actions that
various, undisclosed municipalities or taxing jurisdictions may file additional
cases against the Company, Lowestfare.com Incorporated and Travelweb LLC in the
future.  Some of those municipalities or
taxing jurisdictions have sent the Company and/or its subsidiaries tax notices
or demands, including Brunswick County and Stanly County, North Carolina,
Jefferson County, Arkansas, City of North Little Rock, Arkansas, and the Pine
Bluff Advertising and Promotion Commission.

The Company intends to defend
vigorously against the claims in all of the aforementioned proceedings.

Consumer
Class Actions

Marshall, et
al. v. priceline.com, Inc.

:  On February 17, 2005, a putative class
action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware for
New Castle County by Jeanne Marshall and three other individuals on behalf of
themselves and a putative class of allegedly similarly situated consumers
nationwide against the Company.  The
complaint alleged that the Company violated the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act,
Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 2511,

et seq

.,
relating to its disclosures and charges to customers to cover taxes under city
hotel occupancy tax ordinances nationwide, and service fees.  The Company moved to dismiss the complaint on
April 21, 2005.  On June 10,
2005, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that asserts claims under the
Delaware Consumer Fraud Act and for breach of contract and the implied duty of
good faith and fair dealing.  The amended
complaint seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and
other relief.  On October 31, 2006,
the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to
dismiss.  The court dismissed all claims
arising under the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act. 
The court also dismissed all claims for breach of contract and the
implied duty of good faith and fair dealing that relate to Company’s charges
for service fees.  The court denied the
Company’s motion to dismiss the breach of contract and implied duty of good
faith and fair dealing claims as they relate to the Company’s charges to
consumers to cover taxes under city hotel occupancy tax ordinances.  The parties are currently conducting
discovery.  The plaintiffs have stated
their intent to seek leave to amend their complaint.

Bush, et al. v.
Cheaptickets, Inc., et al.

:  On February 17, 2005, a putative class
action complaint was filed in Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles by
Ronald Bush and three other individuals on behalf of themselves and other
allegedly similarly situated California consumers against the Company and
several of the same defendants as named in the

City of Los
Angeles

action (discussed above). 
The complaint alleges each of the defendants engaged in acts of unfair
competition in violation of Section 17200 relating to their respective
disclosures and charges to customers to cover taxes under the above ordinances
of the City of Los Angeles and other California cities, and service fees.  The complaint seeks restitution, relief for
alleged conversion, including punitive damages, injunctive relief, and
imposition of a constructive trust.  On July 1,
2005, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding claims pursuant to
California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code §1750,

et seq

. and claims for breach of contract and the implied
duty of good faith and fair dealing.  On December 2,
2005, the court ordered limited discovery and ordered that motions challenging
the amended complaint would be coordinated with any similar motions filed in
the

City of Los Angeles

action.  Since that time, the Company has provided
limited discovery and opposed the plaintiffs’ motion to compel further
discovery.

The Company intends to defend
vigorously against the claims in all of the aforementioned proceedings.

Other
Possible Actions


At various times the Company has
also received inquiries or proposed tax assessments from municipalities and
other taxing jurisdictions relating to its charges and remittance of amounts to
cover state and local hotel occupancy and other related taxes.  The City of New Orleans, Louisiana, the City
of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Miami-Dade County, Florida, Broward County,
Florida, the City of Anaheim, California, and state tax officials from
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, among others, have begun formal or
informal administrative procedures or stated that they may assert claims
against the Company relating to allegedly unpaid state or local hotel occupancy
or related taxes.  In addition, the State
of New Jersey Department of Taxation has begun an audit related to the state’s
Corporation Business Tax.  The Company is
unable at this time to predict whether any such proceedings or assertions will
result in litigation.

The Company intends to defend
vigorously against the claims in all of the aforementioned proceedings.

Litigation
Related to Securities Matters

On March 16, March 26,
April 27, and June 5, 2001, respectively, four putative class action
complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York naming priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul
Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc.
and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as defendants (01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576,
01 Civ. 3590 and 01 Civ. 4956).  Shives

et al

. v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

., 01 Civ. 4956, also names other
defendants and states claims unrelated to the Company.  The complaints allege, among other things,
that priceline.com and the individual defendants violated the federal
securities laws by issuing and selling priceline.com common stock in
priceline.com’s March 1999 initial public offering without disclosing to
investors that some of the underwriters in the offering, including the lead
underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received excessive and undisclosed
commissions from certain investors.  By
Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these
cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes with hundreds of other cases,
which contain allegations concerning the allocation of shares in the initial
public offerings of companies other than priceline.com, Inc.  By Order of Judge Scheindlin dated August 14,
2001, the following cases were consolidated for all purposes:  01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576; and 01 Civ.
3590.  On April 19, 2002, plaintiffs
filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these cases.  This Consolidated Amended Class Action
Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with respect
to both the Company’s March 1999 initial public offering and the Company’s
August 1999 second public offering of common stock.  The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc.,
Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman,
Timothy G. Brier, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs &
Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson
Stephens, Inc. (as successor-in-interest to BancBoston), Credit Suisse
First Boston Corp. (as successor-in-interest to Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp.), Allen & Co., Inc. and Salomon Smith
Barney, Inc.  Priceline, Richard
Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier,
together with other issuer defendants in the consolidated litigation, filed a
joint motion to dismiss on July 15, 2002. 
On November 18, 2002, the cases against the individual defendants
were dismissed without prejudice and without costs.  In addition, counsel for plaintiffs and the
individual defendants executed Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements,
which toll the statutes of limitations on plaintiffs’ claims against those
individuals.  On February 19, 2003,
Judge Scheindlin issued an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in
part the issuer’s motion.  None of the
claims against the Company were dismissed. 
On June 26, 2003, counsel for the plaintiff class announced that
they and counsel for the issuers had agreed to the form of a Memorandum of
Understanding (the “Memorandum”) to settle claims against the issuers.  The terms of that Memorandum provide that
class members will be guaranteed $1 billion in recoveries by the insurers of
the issuers and that settling issuer defendants will assign to the class
members certain claims that they may have against the underwriters.  Issuers also agree to limit their abilities
to bring certain claims against the underwriters.  If recoveries in excess of $1 billion are obtained
by the class from any non-settling defendants, the settling defendants’
monetary obligations to the class plaintiffs will be satisfied; any amount
recovered from the underwriters that is less than $1 billion will be


paid by the insurers on behalf of the issuers.  The Memorandum, which is subject to the
approval of each issuer, was approved by a special committee of the
priceline.com Board of Directors on Thursday, July 3, 2003.  Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff class
and counsel for the issuers agreed to the form of a Stipulation and Agreement
of Settlement with Defendant Issuers and Individuals (“Settlement Agreement”).  The Settlement Agreement implements the
Memorandum and contains the same material provisions.  On June 11, 2004, a special committee of
the priceline.com Board of Directors authorized the Company’s counsel to
execute the Settlement Agreement on behalf of the Company.  The Settlement Agreement was submitted to the
Court for approval.  Subsequently, the
Second Circuit reversed the District Court’s granting of class certification in
certain of the related class actions.  As
a result, the parties entered into a stipulation and order dated June 25,
2007 which terminated the Settlement Agreement. 
The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims in all these
proceedings.

On May 3, 2007, the Company entered into a
Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (“Settlement Agreement”) to settle a
class action lawsuit brought after its announcement that third quarter 2000
revenues would not meet expectations. 
Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the class received $80
million in return for a release, with prejudice, of all claims against the
Company and the individual defendants (the “Settling Defendants”) that are
related to the purchase of the Company’s securities by class members during the
class period.  The Company’s insurance
carriers funded $30 million of the settlement. 
As a result, the Company recorded a 2007 net charge of approximately
$55.4 million representing its share of the cost to settle the litigation
and cover related expenses.

The Company will
continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of these
matters, and to the extent appropriate, it will reserve for those estimates of
liabilities.

Other Litigation

On January 6, 1999, we received notice that a
third party patent applicant and patent attorney, Thomas G. Woolston,
purportedly had filed in December 1998 with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office a request to declare an interference between a patent application
filed by Woolston and our U.S. Patent 5,794,207.  We are currently awaiting information from
the Patent Office regarding whether it will initiate an interference
proceeding.

From time to time, we have been and expect to
continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of business, including claims of alleged infringement of third party
intellectual property rights.  Such
claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources, divert management’s attention from our
business objectives and could adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Employment Contracts

The
Company has employment agreements with certain members of senior management
that provide for cash severance payments of up to approximately $17 million,
accelerated vesting of equity instruments, including without limitation,
restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units upon,
among other things, death or a termination without “cause” or “good reason”, as
those terms are defined in the agreements, and a gross-up for the payment of “golden
parachute” excise taxes.  In addition,
the agreements provide for the extension of health and insurance benefits after
termination for periods of up to three years.

Operating Leases

The
Company leases certain facilities and equipment through operating leases.
Rental expense for operating leases was approximately $4.4 million, $3.8
million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The Company’s executive, administrative, operating offices
and network operations center are located in approximately 92,000 square feet
of leased office


space located in Norwalk, Connecticut. 
Booking.com Limited leases approximately 11,000 square feet of office
space primarily in Cambridge, England. 
Booking.com B.V. leases approximately 85,000 square feet of office space
primarily in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 
Minimum payments for operating leases having initial or remaining
non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows (in thousands):

Airline Excise Tax Refund

The
online travel industry received guidance in the fourth quarter of 2006 in the
form of a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the fee earned by
online intermediaries in connection with the facilitation of the purchase of
airline tickets is not subject to Federal Excise Tax.  Due to the prior
lack of clear guidance related to the application of federal excise taxes to
amounts earned by online travel intermediaries, the Company historically remitted
such taxes on the amounts it earned for facilitating the purchase of airline
tickets.  The tax at issue was on the amounts earned by the Company and
was not added to the ticket price paid by its customers.  Accordingly, the
Company sought refunds of the taxes it paid while the on-line travel industry
pursued clarification on the issue.  The
Company recorded refunds received in the amount of $18.6 million in revenue,
plus $3.3 million of interest income during the year ended December 31,
2007.

18.           BENEFIT PLAN

Priceline.com
has a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan (the “Plan”) covering all
U.S. employees who are at least 21 years old. The Plan allows eligible
employees to contribute up to 75% of their eligible earnings, subject to a
statutorily prescribed annual limit.  All
participants are fully vested in their contributions and investment earnings.
As of January 1, 2007, the Company instituted a 50% match of employee
contributions up to 6% of qualified compensation.

The Company also maintains
certain other defined contribution plans outside of the United States for which
it provides 50% of the contributions for participating employees.   The

Company’s matching
contributions during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

were
approximately $0.9 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

20.           SELECTED QUARTERLY
FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited)

The
following table sets forth certain key interim financial information for the
years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:


1.

RESTATEMENT OF

CASH FLOWS AND MINORITY INTEREST PRESENTATION

Subsequent to the
issuance of the Company’s 2006 consolidated financial statements, management identified
and corrected a classification error in the presentation of purchases and sales
of shares in subsidiary held by minority interest of ($19.8 million) and $18.7
million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to
reflect them as investing activities rather than financing activities in the
consolidated statements of cash flows since the Company accounted for such
acquisitions under the purchase accounting method. The classification error had
no impact on the Company’s operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
balances, consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of
operations.  The impact of the classification
error on presentation in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is summarized as follows:

Additionally,
management identified and corrected a classification error in the presentation
of minority interest in the consolidated balance sheet. Minority interest in
the amount of $22.5 million as of December 31, 2006, was previously classified
as a liability and is now presented in the mezzanine section of the
consolidated balance sheet between liabilities and stockholders’ equity. The
classification error had no impact on the Company’s consolidated assets, the total
liabilities and stockholders’ equity line item in the consolidated balance
sheets, consolidated statement of operations or consolidated statements of cash
flows.
