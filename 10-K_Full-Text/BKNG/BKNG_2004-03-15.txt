PART I

Item 1. 
Business

General

Priceline.com
Incorporated (“priceline.com,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading
provider of leisure travel services.  We
have

pioneered a unique e-commerce pricing system known as a “demand
collection system” that enables consumers to use the Internet to save money on
products and services while enabling sellers to generate incremental revenue.
Using a simple and compelling consumer proposition -

Name Your Own Price

®

- we collect consumer
demand, in the form of individual customer offers, for a particular product or
service at a price set by the customer. 
We then access databases to determine whether we can fulfill the
customer’s offer. For most of these transactions, we establish the price we
will accept, have discretion in supplier selection, purchase and take title to
the particular product and are the merchant of record. Consumers agree to hold
their offers open for a specified period of time and, once fulfilled, offers
generally cannot be canceled. We benefit consumers by enabling them to save
money, while at the same time benefiting sellers by providing them with an
effective revenue management tool capable of identifying and capturing
incremental revenues. By requiring consumers to be flexible with respect to
brands, sellers and product features, we enable sellers to generate incremental
revenue without disrupting their existing distribution channels or retail
pricing structures.

In
addition, we offer value-conscious leisure travelers who are less flexible, a
more traditional travel product that allows them to pick specific carriers or
itineraries.  In these transactions, we
act as agent for the airline, hotel or rental car company (the “retail
model”).  Under the retail model, we
only act as agent as the travel supplier sets the retail price paid by the
consumer, and the supplier is the merchant of record for the transaction.  We believe that the combination of our

Name Your Own Price

®

model and
our retail model allows us to service a broad array of value-conscious
travelers, while providing us with diverse streams of revenue.


Our
business model and brand are currently, through us or affiliates, supporting
several products and service offerings, including the following:

•

Name Your
Own Price

®

leisure airline tickets,
provided by 9 domestic and 26 international airline participants, and travel
insurance;

•

retail airline tickets provided by
substantially every domestic and international carrier that is accessible
through the Worldspan, L.P. global distribution system;

•

Name Your Own
Price

®

hotel rooms, in
substantially all major United States markets with more than 40 national hotel
chains, and in a limited number of markets outside the United States;

•

retail hotel rooms provided through our
affiliate Travelweb LLC, offering full-service automated hotel distribution;

•

Name Your
Own Price

®

rental cars, in
substantially all major United States airport markets with five leading rental
car chains as participants;

•

retail rental cars provided by over more than
50 rental car suppliers;

•

fixed-price cruises, through a third party
that accesses major cruise lines;

•

vacation packages, in many United States and
certain international markets; and

•

home financing services through our affiliate
pricelinemortgage, in substantially all major United States markets, which
includes home mortgage services, home equity loans and refinancing services.

For
the year ended December 31, 2003, we had revenues of approximately $863.7
million.  Revenues for 2003 consisted
primarily of merchant revenue, agency revenue and other revenue.  Merchant revenues are derived from
transactions where we are the merchant of record and determine the price to be
paid by the customer.  Merchant
revenues, which represented the substantial majority of our total revenues in
2003, consisted of: transaction revenues from the sale of

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms
and rental cars; ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking
fees charged in connection with

Name Your
Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms
and rental cars

; and customer processing fees charged in connection
with the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars. 
Agency revenues are generally derived from retail travel related
transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of
our products are determined by third parties (for example, the sale of retail
airline tickets). Agency revenues consisted primarily of: processing fees and
third-party supplier commissions related to the sale of travel products
including the sale of price disclosed airline tickets, cruises and other travel
services; and ancillary fees, including global distribution system (GDS)
reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed transactions.

Other revenues consisted
primarily of advertising revenues and fees earned for referring customers to
affiliates and others.

Priceline.com
was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1997 and was converted
into a Delaware corporation in July 1998. 
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol “PCLN.”  Our principal executive
offices are located at 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 06854.

The
priceline.com Business Model

Name Your Own Price

®

.  We have developed a unique pricing system
known as a “demand collection system” that uses the information sharing and
communications power of the Internet to create a


new
way of pricing products and services. 
We believe we have created a balance between the interests of buyers,
who are willing to accept trade-offs in order to save money, and sellers, who
are prepared to generate incremental revenue by selling products at below
retail prices, provided that they can do so without disrupting their existing
distribution channels or retail pricing structures.  Our demand collection system allows consumers to specify the
price they are prepared to pay when submitting an offer for a particular
leisure travel product or service within a specified range of
substitutability.  We then access
databases in which participating suppliers file secure discounted rates not
generally available to the public, to determine whether we can fulfill the customer’s
offer and then decide whether we want to accept the offer at the price
designated by the consumer.  For most of
these transactions, we establish the price we will accept, have discretion in
supplier selection, purchase and take title to the particular leisure travel
product and are the merchant of record. 
Consumers agree to hold their offers open for a specified period of time
to enable us to fulfill their offers from inventory provided by participating
sellers.  Once fulfilled, offers
generally cannot be canceled.  This
system uses the flexibility of buyers to enable sellers to accept a lower price
in order to sell excess inventory or capacity. 
We believe that our demand collection system addresses limitations
inherent in traditional seller-driven pricing mechanisms in a manner that offers
substantial benefits to both buyers and sellers.  We believe that the principal advantages of our system include
the following:

•

Cost Savings

.  Our

Name Your Own Price

®

demand collection system allows consumers to save money in a simple and
compelling way.  Buyers effectively
trade off flexibility about brands, product features and/or sellers in return
for prices that are lower than those that can be obtained at that time through
traditional retail distribution channels.

•

Incremental Revenue for Sellers

.  Sellers use priceline.com as a revenue
management tool to generate incremental revenue without disrupting their
existing distribution channels or retail pricing structures.  We require consumers to be flexible with
respect to brands and product features. 
As a result, with the exception of our price-disclosed products,
sellers’ brands are not revealed to customers prior to the consummation of a
transaction, thereby protecting their brand integrity.  This shielding of brand identity and price
enables sellers to sell products and services at discounted prices without
cannibalizing their own retail sales by publicly announcing discount prices and
without competing against their own distributors.

•

Proprietary Seller Networks

.  We have assembled proprietary networks of
industry leading sellers that represent high quality brands.  By establishing attractive networks of
seller participants with reputations for quality, scale and national presence,
we believe that we foster increased participation by both buyers and sellers.

We often refer to products offered through our

Name Your Own Price

®

service as
opaque products.


Disclosed Price Products

.  In 2003, we began offering
customers the ability

to purchase retail airline
tickets at disclosed prices

.  In these transactions, we act as agent for
the travel supplier.

The
travel supplier sets the retail price paid by the consumer, and the supplier is
the merchant of record for the transaction. 
In 2003, we also invested in and entered into a distribution agreement
with Travelweb LLC, a full-service automated hotel distribution network owned
by various affiliates of Marriott International, Inc., Hilton Hotels
Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Starwood Hotels
& Resorts Worldwide, Inc. and Pegasus Solutions, Inc.  Under the terms of the agreement, Travelweb
became the primary provider of published-price hotel inventory in the United
States and Canada for Lowestfare.com and priceline.com.  In addition, in 2003, we purchased the
Internet domain names www.rentalcars.com and www.breezenet.com, and their
related intellectual property.  Through
these sites, we offer consumers access to over 50 retail rental car suppliers
and earn commissions on successful rental car reservation bookings.  For agency sales, we may receive
commissions, processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees for our services.

We believe that the combination of our

Name Your Own Price

®

model and
our retail model allows us to service a broad array of value-conscious
travelers, while providing us with diverse streams of revenue.

The
priceline.com Strategy

After the events of September 11, 2001, we experienced a decrease in
the momentum of our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket business due to weakened demand for air travel and widespread
discounting by the airlines.  Despite
this challenge, the online travel category has continued to experience
significant growth as consumer purchasing shifts from traditional off-line
channels to interactive online channels. 
We have adopted the following strategies, among others, designed to
better position priceline.com to participate in the growth of the online travel
category, reinforce our value proposition and achieve growth in bookings, gross
profit and earnings.

•

Expand the Airline Ticket Product

.  Our unit sales of airline tickets decreased
approximately 36% in 2002 and approximately 39% in 2003.  Our business prospects would be enhanced if
we could stabilize and grow our sales of leisure airline tickets.  We launched a new price-disclosed airline
product in the fourth quarter 2003 to improve conversion of site traffic and
expand our market opportunity in view of the shrinking market for opaque ticket
sales.  Although in the fourth quarter
2003, the new product resulted in a decrease of

Name Your Own Price

®

sales, we saw an increase in
ticket sales as a whole, and the gross profit contribution from such increase
more than offset the decrease in

Name Your
Own Price

®

ticket sales. 
We believe that the offering of price-disclosed airline tickets as a
compliment to

Name Your Own Price

®

tickets will result in improved airline ticket sales and improved demand for
other products.

•

Grow Hotel Business

.  During 2003, we sold over 5.7 million room
nights, an increase of 39% over 2002, and we intend to continue investing in
the growth of our hotel product.  In the
beginning of 2003, we launched a major television campaign focused on hotels,
and we intend to continue to aggressively advertise our hotel products in
2004.  In 2003, we also entered the
retail hotel market by entering into an agreement with, and making an
investment in, Travelweb LLC, an automated hotel distribution network owned in
part by five major hotel companies.  In
2004, we intend to expand our retail hotel offering.

•

Grow Vacation Packages Product

.  We also intend to further develop our
vacation packages product, through which customers can purchase hotel room
nights and airfare for one price.  In
the fourth quarter 2003, we launched a new package product with disclosed
prices, more flight options and a last minute “Weekender” product offering
flight time windows.  Upon the
re-launch, package unit sales increased sharply.  Since airline ticket


demand is a key source of package customers, we believe that increased
demand for airline tickets will add additional momentum to package sales.

Leisure
Airline Tickets

.  There are
a total of 9 domestic airlines and 26 international airlines participating in
our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service, which represents the majority of our leisure
airline ticket sales.

The
vast majority of all airline ticket requests are made through our
websites.  To make an offer, a customer
specifies: (1) the origin and destination of the trip, (2) the dates on which
the customer wishes to depart and return, (3) the price the customer is willing
to pay, and (4) the customer’s valid credit card to guarantee the offer.  When making an offer, consumers must agree
to:

•

fly on any one
of our participating airline partners;

•

leave at any
time of day between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on their desired dates of departure and
return;

•

purchase only
round trip coach class tickets between the same two points of departure and
return;

•

accept at least
one stop or connection;

•

receive no
frequent flier miles or upgrades; and

•

accept tickets
that cannot be refunded or changed.

When
we receive an offer, we determine whether to fulfill the offer based upon,
among other things, the available fares, rules and inventory provided to us by
our participating airlines and certain other internal requirements.  A customer is usually notified whether his
or her offer has been accepted in near real-time.  If we are able to obtain an airline ticket within the parameters
specified by the customer, the customer’s offer is accepted and his or her
credit card is charged the offer price, plus applicable taxes, surcharges and
standard processing fees, and the ticket is delivered to the customer by the
delivery method specified by the customer. 
For customers who request it, we guarantee no more than one connection
per leg of trip with a maximum of a 3-hour stop.  As with our other travel products, once a customer’s offer for
airline tickets is accepted, that offer, in almost all cases, cannot be
withdrawn or cancelled.

If
a customer’s offer is not accepted, but we believe the offer is reasonably
close to a price that we would be willing to accept, we will attempt to satisfy
the customer by providing guidance to the customer indicating that changing
certain parameters of the offer would increase the chances of the offer being
accepted.  For example, in some cases we
disclose to the customer that agreeing to fly into an alternate airport would
increase the chances of his or her offer being accepted.  In other cases, we inform the customer that
increasing his or her offer by a certain amount would increase the chances of
it being accepted.  We may also offer a
customer the opportunity to purchase a price-disclosed retail airline ticket
through Lowestfare.com.

Retail Leisure Airline Tickets.

In 2002, we began offering certain customers
who were unsuccessful in making a

Name Your
Own Price

®

airline ticket
offer the option to purchase a retail airline ticket at a disclosed price
through Lowestfare.com.  In

October 2003,
we expanded this offering by


launching
a new feature on our website that allows our customers to purchase retail
airline tickets at disclosed prices and with disclosed itineraries.  In these transactions, we act as agent for
the airline.  The airline sets the
retail price paid by the consumer and is the merchant of record for the
transaction.  We believe that the
combination of our

Name Your Own Price

®

model and this retail model allows us to service a broad array of
value-conscious travelers, while providing us with diverse streams of revenue.

Hotels

.  Our

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation service currently is available in substantially
all major cities and metropolitan areas in the United States.  Seller participants in the hotel room
reservation service include most of the significant national hotel chains as
well as several important real estate investment trusts and independent
property owners.  Hotels participate by
filing secure private discounted rates with related inventory control rules in
a global distribution system database. 
These specific rates generally are not available to the general public
or to consolidators and other discount distributors who sell to the public,
however, hotel participants may make similar rates available to consolidators
or other discount providers under other arrangements.

Our

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation service operates in a manner similar to our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service. 
Consumers are required to accept certain trade-offs with respect to
brands or product features in return for saving money.  For example, consumers are required to
accept a reservation in any hotel within a specified geographic area within a
designated “class” of service (1, 2, 3, 4, 5-star or “resort”) and must accept
limitations on changes and cancellations.  As with the airline ticket service, the target market for our
hotel room reservation service is the leisure travel market.

In
March 2003, we announced that Lowestfare.com, our wholly-owned subsidiary, had
entered into a distribution agreement with Travelweb LLC.

Travelweb LLC is a full-service automated hotel
distribution network owned by Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Intercontinental Hotels
Group, Starwood Hotels and Pegasus Solutions. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Travelweb LLC became the primary provider
of published-price, net rate inventory in the United States and Canada for
Lowestfare.com and priceline.com and Travelweb LLC pays us commissions.  In connection with the distribution
agreement, Lowestfare.com made an $8.6 million investment in Travelweb LLC and
received approximately 15% of the equity of Travelweb LLC and a seat on
Travelweb LLC’s Board of Directors.  We
intend to use our relationship with Travelweb LLC to expand and grow our retail
hotel business.

Rental Cars

Our

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car service operates in a manner similar to our airline ticket and hotel
reservation services.  Our rental car
services are currently available in substantially all major United States
airport markets.  The top five brands
name airport rental car companies in the United States are seller participants
in our rental car program.  Consumers
can access our website and select where and when they want to rent a car, what
kind of car they want to rent (i.e., economy, compact, mid-size, SUV) and the
price they want to pay per-day, excluding taxes, fees and surcharges.  When we receive an offer, we determine
whether to fulfill the offer based upon the available rates, rules and
inventory.  If a customer’s offer is
accepted, we will immediately reserve the rental car, charge the customer’s
credit card and notify the customer of the car rental company and location
providing the rental car.

In
2003, we supplemented our

Name Your Own
Price

®

rental car offering by acquiring the Internet
domain names www.rentalcars.com and www.breezenet.com, and their related
intellectual property.

Through these sites, we offer consumers access to
over 50 retail rental car suppliers and earn commissions on successful rental
car reservation bookings.  Currently, we
operate both sites as stand-alone websites that contain links to rental car
suppliers, as well as to priceline.com. 
In 2004, we intend to provide consumers with an improved rental car
product by implementing technological and functionality improvements to both
sites, which we believe will ultimately improve our share of the retail rental
car market.


Vacation Packages

.  In February 2002, we began offering our vacation package product,
which allowed consumers to determine their own price for packages consisting of
airfare and hotel or resort room nights. 
In the fourth quarter 2003, we re-launched our package product with
fixed prices, more flight options and a last minute “Weekender” product
offering flight time windows.  We are
the merchant of record for vacation packages sold through our websites.

Cruises

.  We
also offer fixed-price cruise trips through NLG, Inc., an agent representing
major cruise lines.  Our cruise product
allows consumers to search for and compare cruise pricing and availability
information from 9 major cruise lines, and to purchase cruises online or
through a call center by selecting from our published offerings and
prices.  We receive commissions from
NLG, Inc. for our services.

Travel Insurance

.  We offer our air, hotel and vacation package customers an
optional travel insurance package that provides coverage for, among other
things, trip cancellation, trip interruption, medical expenses, emergency
evacuation, and loss of baggage, property and travel documents.  The travel insurance is provided by member
companies of American International Group, Inc.  We receive a percentage of the premium from AIG member companies
for every optional insurance package purchased by our customers.

While
we are currently focused on the travel products and services described above,
over time, we may evaluate the introduction of other products and services that
we believe could enhance the travel experience of our customers.

Home
Financing Services

We
offer home financing services through pricelinemortgage.com, of which we own
49% and hold two seats on the board of directors.  Pursuant to an intellectual property license from us,
pricelinemortgage.com utilizes the priceline.com

Name Your Own Price®

business model.  Pricelinemortgage.com is controlled by
EverBank, a federally chartered savings association supervised by the Office of
Thrift Supervision and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alliance Partners,
L.P.  Pricelinemortgage.com has access
to the management resources and expertise of Alliance Partners, L.P. and its
affiliates, including Alliance Mortgage Company, a residential mortgage lender
since 1962.  Alliance Partners, L.P.
provides management services to pricelinemortgage.com, including the
procurement of personnel and office space and assistance in obtaining
regulatory approvals. 
Pricelinemortgage.com is operating in all 50 states.  Robert J. Mylod, our Chief Financial
Officer, is a director of, and an investor in, Alliance Capital Partners Inc.,
the parent company of Alliance Partners, L.P. 
Mr. Mylod’s investment represents less than 1/10 of one percent of
Alliance Capital Partners Inc.’s outstanding common stock.

Under
the terms of an agreement with Alliance Partners, L.P., our financing service
allows consumers to name their interest rate and points for mortgages of a
specified term, including purchase money mortgages, refinancings and home
equity loans.  As a general matter, to
obtain a loan, consumers access our website and specify the amount of the loan,
the term, the interest rate and the points that they are willing to pay.  Customers complete a simplified loan
application as part of the process of making an offer.  In connection with making an offer,
customers are required to guarantee with a major credit card the payment of a
$250 deposit that is applied towards closing costs and returned if we cannot
find a participating lender to accept the offer.  We notify a customer within six hours whether his or her offer
has been accepted by a participating lender.  Participating lenders may submit counteroffers through us for up
to one business day following the customer’s offer.

International

In certain instances, we
have licensed the priceline.com name and demand collection system to third
parties to offer a number of products or services in a distinct international
region.  Pursuant to these


licensee transactions, we generally receive a royalty under the license
and may also receive fees for services and reimbursement of certain
expenses.  We also hold equity interests
in such entities.

Asia

.  In
October 2003, we restructured our relationship with Hutchison-Priceline Limited
(“Hutchison-Priceline”), a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa Limited, or
Hutchison, whereby, among other things, the amount of shares
Hutchison-Priceline is authorized to issue was increased, and the par value of
Hutchison-Priceline common shares was decreased.  Pursuant to the restructuring agreement, priceline.com and
Hutchison converted their outstanding convertible notes into shares of
Hutchison-Priceline, and Hutchison purchased shares and was granted the right
to purchase additional shares in Hutchison-Priceline until March 2004.  After the restructuring, priceline.com and
Hutchison own approximately 15% and 85%, respectively, of the outstanding
equity securities of Hutchison-Priceline. 
Under the new agreements, we continue to license our business model to
Hutchison-Priceline.  Hutchison and
Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited, a company affiliated with Hutchison, own
approximately 34% of our outstanding common stock and hold three seats on our
board of directors.  We hold one seat on
Hutchison-Priceline’s board of directors.

Europe

. 
Priceline.com europe Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that was
established to provide our services to several European markets.  Priceline.com europe Ltd. offers

Name Your Own Price

®

hotels,
and, through third-parties in Europe, airfare, vacation packages and car hire
at disclosed prices.  From its inception
until December 2003, the other investors in priceline.com europe Ltd. included
affiliates of General Atlantic Partners, LLC and certain individual
investors.  In the fourth quarter of
2003, we purchased all of the interest in priceline.com europe Ltd. that we did
not already own.  During 2002, 2001 and
2000, William Ford, a principal of General Atlantic Partners, LLC, was a member
of our board of directors and chairman of our audit committee.  Mr. Ford resigned from our board of
directors in January 2003, because General Atlantic Partners, LLC significantly
reduced its position in our company.  In
2002, we recorded an impairment charge of $12 million in connection with our
investment in priceline.com europe. 
Please see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information about the impairment charge.

Marketing
and Brand Awareness

Priceline.com has established itself as one of the most recognized
e-commerce brands through an aggressive marketing and promotion campaign.  During 2003, our advertising expense was
$42.2 million.  We intend to continue a
marketing strategy to promote brand awareness and the concept that consumers
can save money on products and services offered by priceline.com.  We advertise primarily through television,
radio and online marketing.  Underlying
our marketing strategy is our belief that our target market is all consumers,
not just Internet-savvy consumers.  We
intend to continue to promote the priceline.com brand aggressively throughout
2004.  We intend to devote our marketing
resources to the re-launch of our airline ticket product, as well as the
continued support of our hotel product.

Competition

We compete with both online and traditional sellers of the products and
services offered on priceline.com. The market for the products and services we
offer is intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new
sites at a relatively low cost. In addition, over the recent past, the on-line
travel industry has consolidated, a trend we expect to continue. For example,
in June 2003, InterActive Corp., formerly USA Interactive, Inc., acquired
all of Expedia, Inc., the largest seller of on-line travel, and in August
2003, Hotels.com L.P., one of the largest on-line sellers of hotel rooms. In addition,
in November 2003, InterActive Corp. acquired Hotwire.com, a website that offers
discounted fares on “opaque” inventory, and is our primary competitor. If this
trend continues, we may not be able to effectively compete with industry
conglomerates such as InterActive Corp. that have access to significantly
greater and more diversified resources than we do.  For example, InterActive Corp. has indicated that it intends to
advertise its travel products at spending levels that far exceed our intended


advertising
spending.  See “

Factors That May Affect Future Results – Intense
Competition Could Reduce our Market Share and Harm our Financial Performance

.”

We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies with
respect to each product or service we offer. With respect to travel products,
these competitors include:

•

Internet travel
services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, all of which are owned by
InterActive Corp., Travelocity, which is owned by the Sabre Group and
Cheaptickets, which is owned by the Cendant Corporation;

•

Companies that
are owned in significant part by certain of our suppliers, such as Orbitz, and
Travelweb LLC;

•

traditional
travel agencies;

•

consolidators
and wholesalers of airline tickets and other travel products, including online
consolidators such as Hotels.com and Cheaptickets.com;

•

individual or
groups of airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise operators and other
travel service providers (all of which may provide services by telephone or
through their branded website); and

•

operators of
global distribution systems such as Gallileo, Worldspan, L.P. and Sabre.

A number of airlines, including a number that participate in our system,
have invested in and offer discount airfares and travel services through the
Orbitz Internet travel service, and a number of airlines, including a number
that participate in our system, participate in Hotwire. Because of its close
relationship with such airlines, Orbitz is in a position to forego certain
revenue streams upon which other online travel suppliers, including us, may be
dependent, such as commissions and global distribution system fees.  Orbitz launched an initial public offering
in December 2003, which will likely result in an increase in its financial
resources, which could be applied to higher marketing spend or acquisitions.

Hotwire, which is our primary competitor in the opaque space, provides
airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental car reservations at disclosed prices,
although supplier identity and flight times are undisclosed until after the
customer agrees to the purchase. Since its launch, Hotwire has been successful
in establishing itself in the online travel marketplace through aggressive
advertising, which has had the effect of decreasing our market share. As
discussed above, in November 2003, InterActive Corp. acquired Hotwire.com.  InterActive Corp. is a larger company, and
has greater resources, than us. If we are unable to effectively compete with
Hotwire, our business, results of operation and financial condition will be
adversely affected.

With respect to financial service products, competitors of
pricelinemortgage include banks and other financial institutions and online and
traditional mortgage and insurance brokers, including mortgage.com, Quicken
Mortgage, E-Loan, Lending Tree and iOwn, Inc. In the third quarter of
2003, InterActive Corp. acquired Lending Tree.

We potentially face competition from a number of large Internet
companies and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and in
facilitating Internet traffic, including Amazon.com and Yahoo!, who could
choose to compete with us either directly or indirectly through affiliations
with other e-commerce or off-line companies. Other large companies with strong
brand recognition, technical expertise and experience in Internet commerce
could also seek to compete with us. Competition from these and other sources
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.


Many of our current and potential competitors, including Internet
directories, search engines and large traditional retailers, have longer
operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and
significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than
priceline.com. Some of these competitors may be able to secure products and
services on more favorable terms than we can. In addition, many of these
competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to:

•

marketing and
promotional campaigns;

•

attracting
traffic to their websites;

•

attracting and
retaining key employees;

•

securing vendors
and inventory; and

•

website and
systems development.

Increased competition could result in reduced operating margins, loss of
market share and damage to our brand. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competition
will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Operations
and Technology

Our
business is supported by a systems platform, which was designed with an
emphasis on scalability, performance and reliability.  Our core demand collection and offer processing systems are
proprietary to priceline.com.  The
software platform and architecture are built on server-side Java, C++ and SQL
scripts integrated with an Oracle relational database system.  This internal platform was designed to
include open application protocol interfaces that can provide connectivity to
vendors in the industries in which we operate. 
These include large global inventory systems, such as airline and hotel
room reservation systems and financial service providers, as well as individual
inventory suppliers, such as individual hotels.  Our Internet servers utilize VeriSign digital certificates to
help us conduct secure communications and transactions.

We out-source most of our call center and customer service functions,
and use a real-time interactive voice response system with transfer
capabilities to our call centers and customer service centers in Norwalk,
Connecticut, Columbus, Ohio, Sunrise, Florida and Brownsville, Pennsylvania.

We
rely on the global distribution system of Worldspan, L.P. in the sale of
airline tickets, opaque hotel room reservations, and rental car
reservation.  We do not have a back-up
GDS and if Worldspan GDS becomes inaccessible, or partially inaccessible to us,
due to system failure or otherwise, for any significant amount of time, our
ability to book airline tickets, opaque hotel reservations and rental car
reservations would be adversely affected, and our business, results of
operations and financial condition would suffer.

Our systems infrastructure and Web and database servers are hosted at
Cable & Wireless plc. in Jersey City, New Jersey, which provides
communication links, as well as 24-hour monitoring and engineering
support.  Cable & Wireless has its
own generator and multiple back-up systems in Jersey City.  Substantial amounts of our computer hardware
for operating our services are currently located at Cable & Wireless in
Jersey City.  We also maintain a second
Web hosting facility at AT&T in New York City.  Our network operations center monitors both Web hosting
facilities and is located in our Norwalk, Connecticut headquarters.  All three facilities have an uninterruptible
power supply system, generators and redundant servers.  If Cable & Wireless were unable, for any
reason, to support our primary web hosting facility, we would need to activate
our secondary site at AT&T.  See “

Intellectual
Property

We currently hold fourteen issued United States patents, Nos.
5,794,207; 5,797,127; 5,897,620; 6,041,308; 6,085,169; 6,108,639; 6,134,534;

6,553,346 and over 20 pending United States and foreign patent
applications.  All of our issued United
States patents expire between September 4, 2016 and July 8, 2017.  We file additional patent applications on
new inventions, as appropriate.

While we believe that our issued patents and pending patent
applications help to protect our business, there can be no assurance that:

•

any patent can
be successfully defended against challenges by third parties;

•

the pending
patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;

•

competitors or
potential competitors of priceline.com will not devise new methods of competing
with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications;

•

because of
variations in the application of our business model to each of our products and
services, our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third parties
from utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same product or service in
one or more categories;

•

new prior art
will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued
patent; or

•

a third party
will not have or obtain one or more patents that can prevent us from practicing
features of our business or that will require us to pay for a license to use
those features.

There
has been discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of
so-called “business method” patents. As a result, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office has indicated that it intends to intensify the review process
applicable to such patent applications. The new procedures are not expected to
have a direct

effect on patents already granted. We cannot
anticipate what effect, if any, the new review process will have on our pending
patent applications. See, “

We currently own the Internet domain name

regulated by Internet regulatory bodies. 
The relationship between trademark and unfair competition laws and
domain name registration is evolving. 
The Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in the U.S. and the
Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy of the World Intellectual Property
Organization have both significantly enhanced the ability to deter the improper
incorporation of trademarks into domain names by third parties and to assert
our registrations against them.  We
actively pursue significant infringers as appropriate, including cybersquatters

of their distinctiveness.  See, “

Factors That May Affect Future Results — Our Success
Depends On Our Ability To Protect Our Intellectual Property

.”

Governmental
Regulation

The
products and services we provide are subject to various federal, state and
local regulations. For example, our travel service is subject to laws governing
the offer and/or sale of travel services as well as laws requiring us to
register as a “seller of travel.”

In addition, our business is indirectly affected by
regulatory and legal uncertainties affecting travel suppliers and global
distribution systems.  On January 7,
2004, the Department of Transportation published a Final Rule, abolishing most
of its rules governing global distribution systems effective January 31, 2004,
and the rest of the rules effective July 31, 2004.  As a part of the Final Rule, the DOT rejected proposals to
regulate online travel service providers’ fare displays.  However, the DOT deferred consideration of a
proposal to amend its policies regarding advertising of air tickets, to require
that agency service fees be stated separately from the price being charged by
the airlines.  Our current service fee
disclosure practices differ from those proposed by the DOT.  If the DOT were to resume consideration of
and adopt the service fee proposal, we may have less flexibility regarding
merchandising air travel on our websites.

We are also subject to laws
governing the licensing and conduct of persons providing mortgage brokerage
services. Such laws typically require certain consumer protection disclosures
and loan solicitation procedures. For example, the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act prohibits the payment and receipt of mortgage loan referral
fees, and permits persons to be compensated only for the fair market value of
non-referral services. Accordingly, our home financing service provides
non-referral services such as website development and advertising to a licensed
mortgage broker who, in turn, provides the back-end processing for loan
referrals.

All
of our services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and
regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices.

We
are also subject to regulations applicable to businesses conducting online
commerce. Today there are relatively few laws specifically directed toward
online services. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the
Internet and online services, it is possible that laws and regulations will be
adopted with respect to the Internet or online services. These laws and
regulations could cover issues such as online contracts, user privacy, freedom
of expression, pricing, fraud, content and quality of products and services,
taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security.
Applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as
property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues,
taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is developing, but any such new
legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition. In addition, some states may require us to
qualify in that state to do business as a foreign corporation because our
service is available in that state over the Internet. Although we are qualified
to do business in a number of states, failure to meet the qualifications of
certain states, or a determination that we are required to qualify in
additional states, could subject us to taxes and penalties.  See “

Priceline.com
europe Ltd. and Hutchison-Priceline Limited are subject to various foreign
regulations and governing bodies that might limit their products and services.
They may be affected by unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and
various tariffs and trade barriers in connection with online commerce. Any
failure by priceline.com europe Ltd. or Hutchison-Priceline Limited to comply
may have an adverse effect on us.

Employees

As
of March 1, 2004, we employed 293 full-time employees. We also retain
independent contractors to support our customer service and system support
functions.

We
have never had a work stoppage and our employees are not represented by any
collective bargaining unit. We consider our relations with our employees to be
good. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to
attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and
managerial personnel, for whom competition is intense.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

The following risk factors and other information included in
this Annual Report should be carefully considered.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones
we face.  Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
may also impair our business operations. 
If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition,
operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

We have a history of incurring operating losses.

We
had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.6 billion at December 31,
2003.  A depressed retail environment
for the sale of airline tickets and a general decline in leisure travel since
the events of September 11, 2001, have had a negative impact on our
business and results of operations.  If
our gross profit does not grow as expected, we may incur future losses and may
not achieve or sustain profitability in future years.

Our business was negatively impacted by the war in Iraq and
the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and could be further damaged
by future terrorist attacks, travel-related health concerns or the fear
of future terrorist attacks or travel-related health concerns.

In the weeks
following the commencement of the military conflict with Iraq during
March  2003, and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or
SARS, in Asia and elsewhere in the second quarter 2003, we experienced a
substantial decline in demand for our travel products and an increase in customer
service costs and ticket refunds and cancellations. We believe that our first
quarter and second quarter 2003 financial results were adversely affected by
the war in Iraq and the outbreak of SARS. Further military conflict or new
outbreaks of SARS or another travel-related health concern could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, terrorist attacks, the fear of future terrorist
attacks, hostilities involving the United States in other areas of the world or
the fear of future outbreaks like SARS are likely to contribute to a general
reluctance by the public to travel and, as a result, may have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to satisfy customers may be
adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control.

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and, more
recently, following the outbreak of war with Iraq, the major airlines have
grounded portions of their fleets, significantly reducing the number of
available airline seats, and have deeply discounted retail airline tickets to
stimulate demand. These actions


have had a detrimental effect
on our business. Deep retail discounting by the airlines affects our demand by
hurting the

Name Your Own Price

®

value proposition and making users less willing to accept the trade-offs
associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

leisure airline tickets. In addition, decreased airline capacity hurts our
business by reducing the levels of inventory available to us and increasing our
cost of inventory. Customer offer prices have not kept pace with the increase
in our cost of inventory and are, therefore, lower in proportion to our average
cost of supply.

Additionally, our results have been negatively impacted by the weak
retail environment for airline tickets which has persisted since 2001. In
particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally
be willing to make the tradeoff associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

products in exchange for
savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel products at the lower
retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs.  While we recently launched a price-disclosed
offering for airline tickets on our website in an attempt to attract consumers
who may have looked to other websites to buy their airline tickets, there can
be no assurance that the results from the sale of our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets will not be adversely affected by this new product.

We rely on the global distribution system of Worldspan, L.P. in the
sale of airline tickets, opaque hotel room reservations, and rental car
reservation.  We do not have a back-up
GDS and if Worldspan GDS becomes inaccessible, or partially inaccessible to us,
due to system failure or otherwise, for any significant amount of time, our
ability to book airline tickets, opaque hotel reservations and rental car
reservations would be adversely affected, and our results would suffer.

We may not be successful in entering the
retail travel market.

We have historically focused our efforts and resources on our

Name Your Own Price

®

business
model.  We do not have extensive experience
in operating a retail business model and may, therefore, face unforeseen
difficulties in successfully entering the retail travel market.  There can be no assurance that our retail
product will achieve an adequate degree of market acceptance among consumers.  Many of our competitors have more experience
in the retail market than we do, and have invested significantly more than we
have in marketing spend.  In addition,
we may face difficulty from our suppliers in securing and accessing the
inventory necessary to competitively offer a retail travel product.  Our failure to successfully anticipate,
identify and react to any of the difficulties we might face could have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are dependent on the airline industry and
certain airlines.

Our financial prospects are significantly dependent upon our sale of
leisure airline tickets.  Leisure
travel, including the sale of leisure airline tickets, is dependent on personal
discretionary spending levels. As a result, sales of leisure airline tickets
and other leisure travel products tend to decline during general economic
downturns and recessions. In addition, unforeseen events, such as terrorist
attacks, political instability, regional hostilities, increases in fuel prices,
imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel-related
accidents, travel-related health concerns and unusual weather patterns
also may adversely affect the leisure travel industry. As a result, our
business also is likely to be affected by those events. Further, work stoppages
or labor unrest at any of the major airlines could materially and adversely
affect the airline industry and, as a consequence, have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, sales of airline tickets
from our five largest and two largest airline suppliers accounted for
approximately 91.0% and 49.7% of total airline tickets sold, respectively. As a
result, currently we are substantially dependent upon the continued
participation of these airlines in priceline.com in order to maintain and
continue to grow our total gross profit.

We currently have 35 airlines participating in the

Name Your Own Price

®

system.
However, our arrangements with the airlines that participate in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system:


•

do not require
the airlines to make tickets available for any particular routes;

•

do not require
the airlines to provide any specific quantity of airline tickets;

•

do not require
the airlines to provide particular prices or levels of discount;

•

do not require
the airlines to deal exclusively with us in the public sale of discounted airline
tickets;

•

often limit the
manner in which we can sell inventory and, in the case of our agreement with
Delta Air Lines, substantially limits which airlines can participate in the

Name Your Own Price

®

system; and

•

generally, can
be terminated upon little or no notice.

As a general matter, during the course of our business, we are in
continuous dialogue with our major airline suppliers about the nature and
extent of their participation in our system. The significant reduction on the
part of any of our major suppliers of their participation in our system for a
sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.  Moreover, certain airlines
have significantly limited or eliminated sales of airline tickets through
opaque channels, preferring to consistently show the lowest available price on
their own web site.  If one or more
participating airlines were to further limit or eliminate discounting through
opaque channels, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Due to our dependence on the airline industry, we could be severely
affected by changes in that industry, and, in many cases, we will have no
control over such changes or their timing. For example, we believe that our
business has been adversely affected by the general reduction in airline
capacity since September 11, 2001. Further, since the September 11,
2001 terrorist attacks, several major U.S. airlines are struggling financially
and have either filed for reorganization under the United States Bankruptcy
Code or discussed publicly the risks of bankruptcy. To the extent other major
U.S. airlines that participate in our system declare bankruptcy, they may be
unable or unwilling to honor tickets sold for their flights. Our policy in such
event would be to direct customers seeking a refund or exchange to the airline,
and not to provide a remedy ourselves. Because we are the merchant-of-record on
sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets to our customers, however, we could experience a
significant increase in demands for refunds or credit card charge-backs
from customers, which would materially and adversely affect our business. In
addition, because

Name Your Own Price

®

customers do not choose the airlines on which they are to fly, the bankruptcy
of a major U.S. airline or the possibility of a major U.S. airline declaring
bankruptcy could discourage customers from using our

Name Your Own Price

®

system to book airline
tickets.

In addition, given the concentration of the airline industry,
particularly in the domestic market, our competitors could exert pressure on
other airlines not to supply us with tickets. Moreover, the airlines may attempt
to establish their own buyer-driven commerce service or participate or
invest in other similar services, like Hotwire, a website that offers
discounted fares on opaque inventory, or Orbitz LLC, an airline-controlled
website that competes directly with us.

We are dependent on certain hotels.

Our financial prospects are significantly dependent upon our sale of
hotel room nights.  During the year
ended December 31, 2003, sales of hotel room nights from our five largest hotel
suppliers accounted for approximately 47% of total hotel room nights sold.  As a result, currently we are substantially
dependent upon the continued participation of these hotels in priceline.com in
order to maintain and continue to grow our total gross profit.


We currently have more than 40 national hotel chains participating in
the

Name Your Own Price

®

system.  However, our arrangements with
the hotels that participate in our

Name Your
Own Price

®

system generally:

•

do not require the hotels to provide any
specific quantity of hotel rooms;

•

do not require the hotels to provide
particular prices or levels of discount;

•

do not require the hotels to deal exclusively
with us in the public sale of discounted hotel rooms; and

•

generally, can be terminated upon little or no
notice.

As a general matter, during the course of our business, we are in
continuous dialogue with our major hotel suppliers about the nature and extent
of their participation in our system. 
The significant reduction on the part of any of our major suppliers of
their participation in our system for a sustained period of time or their
complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

The bankruptcy, discontinuance or
consolidation of our suppliers could harm our business

.

We are heavily dependent on our suppliers. One of our largest airline
suppliers, United Airlines, is currently operating under the protection of
federal bankruptcy laws, and certain other major suppliers, have disclosed
publicly the possibility of seeking the protection of the federal bankruptcy
laws. If any of our suppliers currently in bankruptcy liquidates or does not
emerge from bankruptcy and we are unable to replace such supplier as a
participant in priceline.com, our business would be adversely affected. In
addition, in the event that another of our major suppliers voluntarily or
involuntarily declares bankruptcy and is subsequently unable to successfully
emerge from bankruptcy, and we are unable to replace such supplier, our
business would be adversely affected. Further, as discussed in “

We are dependent on the airline industry and certain
airlines

”, because our

Name Your
Own Price

®

customers do not choose the airline, hotel or
rental car company on which they are booked, the bankruptcy of a major supplier
or even the possibility of a major supplier declaring bankruptcy, could
discourage consumers from booking their travel products through us.  If any or all of such companies discontinue
their business, and we are unable to find other suppliers, it would have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

If one of our major suppliers merges or consolidates with, or is
acquired by, another company that either does not participate in the
priceline.com system or that participates on substantially lower levels, the
surviving company may elect not to participate in our system or to participate
at lower levels than the previous supplier. In such event, if we are unable to
divert sales to other suppliers, our business results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected.

We issued $125 million of Convertible Senior Notes due
August 2010, which provide for mandatory repayment beginning in 2008 and could
result in dilution of our earnings per share.

In August 2003, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an interest rate of 1%.  The notes are convertible, subject to
certain conditions, into our common stock at the option of the holder, at a
conversion price of approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events. 
Each $1,000 principal amount of notes will initially be convertible into
25 shares of our common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the closing
price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period, as defined in the
offering memorandum related to the notes, is more than 110% of the then current
conversion price of the notes, or after August 1, 2008, the closing price of
our common stock is more than 110% of the then current conversion price of the
notes.  The notes are also convertible
in certain other circumstances set forth in the offering memorandum, such


as a change in control of
priceline.com.  In addition, the notes
will be redeemable at our option beginning in 2008, and the holders may require
us to repurchase the notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other
circumstances.  While we currently have
sufficient cash and short-term investments to repay the notes, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance the notes on the repayment
date.  In addition, the conversion of
the notes into our common stock could result in dilution of our earnings per
share.

In addition, the purchase of our notes with shares of our common stock
or the conversion of the notes into our common stock could result in dilution
of our earnings per share.

Uncertainty regarding payment of sales and
hotel occupancy taxes

.

We are currently conducting a review and interpretation of the tax laws
in various states and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state and
local hotel occupancy and other related taxes. 
In connection with our review, we have met and had discussions with
taxing authorities in certain jurisdictions but the ultimate resolution in any
particular jurisdiction cannot be determined at this time.  Currently, hotels collect and remit hotel
occupancy and related taxes to the various tax authorities based on the amounts
collected by the hotels. Consistent with this practice, we recover the taxes on
the underlying cost of the hotel room night from customers and remit the taxes
to the hotel operators for payment to the appropriate tax authorities. Several
jurisdictions have indicated that they may take the position that hotel
occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by a
customer for our service and the cost to us of the underlying room.
Historically, we have not collected taxes on this differential. Some state and
local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or hotel
occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such taxes,
either retroactively or prospectively or both. Such actions may result in
substantial tax liabilities for past sales and could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent that any tax
authority succeeds in asserting that any such tax collection responsibility
exists, it is likely that, with respect to future transactions, we would
collect any such additional tax obligation from our customers, which would have
the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room nights to our customers and,
consequently, could reduce our hotel sales. We will continue to assess the
risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent
appropriate, we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

Intense competition could reduce our market
share and harm our financial performance

.

We compete with both online and traditional sellers of the products and
services offered on priceline.com. The market for the products and services we
offer is intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new
sites at a relatively low cost. In addition, over the recent past, the on-line
travel industry has consolidated, a trend we expect to continue. For example,
in June 2003, InterActive Corp., formerly USA Interactive, Inc., acquired
all of Expedia, Inc., the largest seller of on-line travel, and in August
2003, Hotels.com L.P., one of the largest on-line sellers of hotel rooms. In
addition, in November 2003, InterActive Corp. acquired Hotwire.com, a website
that offers discounted fares on “opaque” inventory, and is our primary
competitor in the sale of “opaque” travel products. If this trend continues, we
may not be able to effectively compete with industry conglomerates such as
InterActive Corp. that have access to significantly greater and more
diversified resources than we do.  For
example, InterActive Corp. has indicated that it intends to advertise its
travel products at spending levels that far exceed our intended advertising
spending.

We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies with
respect to each product or service we offer. With respect to travel products,
these competitors include:

•

Internet travel
services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, all of which are owned by
InterActive Corp., Travelocity, which is owned by the Sabre Group and
Cheaptickets, which is owned by the Cendant Corporation;


•

Companies that
are owned in significant part by certain of our suppliers, such as Orbitz, and
Travelweb LLC, a full-service automated distributor of hotel rooms that will
compete with us in the online hotel space and that is owned in part by Hilton
Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, Marriott International, Inc.,
Intercontinental Hotels Group, Starwood Hotels and Pegasus
Solutions, Inc.;

•

traditional
travel agencies;

•

consolidators
and wholesalers of airline tickets and other travel products, including online
consolidators such as Hotels.com and Cheaptickets.com;

•

individual or
groups of airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise operators and other
travel service providers (all of which may provide services by telephone or
through their branded website); and

•

operators of
travel industry reservation databases such as Gallileo, Worldspan, L.P. and
Sabre.

A number of airlines, including a number that participate in our system,
have invested in and offer discount airfares and travel services through the
Orbitz Internet travel service, and a number of airlines, including a number
that participate in our system, participate in Hotwire. Because of its close
relationship with such airlines, Orbitz is in a position to forego certain
revenue streams upon which other online travel suppliers, including us, may be
dependent, such as commissions and global distribution system fees.  Orbitz launched an initial public offering
in December 2003, which will likely result in an increase in its financial resources,
which could be applied to higher marketing spend or acquisitions.

Hotwire, which is our primary competitor in the sale of opaque travel
products, provides airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental car reservations at
disclosed prices, although supplier identity and flight times are undisclosed
until after the customer agrees to the purchase. Since its launch, Hotwire has
been successful in establishing itself in the online travel marketplace through
aggressive advertising, which has had the effect of decreasing our market
share. As discussed above, in November 2003, InterActive Corp. acquired
Hotwire.com.  InterActive Corp. is a
larger company, and has greater resources, than us. If we are unable to
effectively compete with Hotwire, our business, results of operation and
financial condition will be adversely affected.

With respect to financial service products, competitors of
pricelinemortgage include banks and other financial institutions and online and
traditional mortgage and insurance brokers, including mortgage.com, Quicken
Mortgage, E-Loan, Lending Tree and iOwn, Inc. In the third quarter of
2003, InterActive Corp. acquired Lending Tree.

We potentially face competition from a number of large Internet
companies and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and in
facilitating Internet traffic, including Amazon.com and Yahoo!, who could
choose to compete with us either directly or indirectly through affiliations
with other e-commerce or off-line companies. Other large companies with strong
brand recognition, technical expertise and experience in Internet commerce
could also seek to compete with us. Competition from these and other sources
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Many of our current and potential competitors, including Internet
directories, search engines and large traditional retailers, have longer
operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and
significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than
priceline.com. Some of these competitors may be able to secure products and
services on more favorable terms than we can. In addition, many of these
competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to:


•

marketing and
promotional campaigns;

•

attracting
traffic to their websites;

•

attracting and
retaining key employees;

•

securing vendors
and inventory; and

•

website and
systems development.

Increased competition could result in reduced operating margins, loss of
market share and damage to our brand. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that
competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our growth cannot be assured. Even if we do
experience growth, we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably

.

Our business strategy is dependent on the growth of our business. For us
to achieve significant growth, consumers and travel suppliers must accept our
website as a valuable commercial tool. Consumers who have historically
purchased travel products using traditional commercial channels, such as local
travel agents and calling suppliers directly, must instead purchase these
products on our website. Similarly, travel suppliers will also need to accept
or expand their use of our website and view our website as an efficient and
profitable channel of distribution for their travel products. Our ability to
enhance awareness of the priceline.com brands and offer products and services
that will attract and retain a significant number of new consumers and travel
suppliers is not certain, and therefore, our growth may be limited.

We may lose or be subject to reduction of
global distribution system fees

.

We rely on fees paid to us by Worldspan, L.P. for travel bookings made
through Worldspan, L.P.’s global distribution system, or GDS, for a substantial
portion of our gross profit and net income. A number of travel suppliers,
particularly airlines, have indicated publicly that, as part of an effort to
reduce distribution costs, they intend to reduce their dependence over time on
what they view to be “expensive” distribution channels such as GDSs. A number
of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that
require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the GDS. Additionally,
travel suppliers are encouraging distributors, such as us, to develop
technology enabling direct connections, therefore bypassing the GDS.
Development of direct connection technology would require the use of
information technology resources and could cause us to incur additional
operating expenses and delay other projects. We have been and believe that we
will continue to be under pressure from travel suppliers to rebate all or part
of the travel booking fees we receive from Worldspan, L.P. To the extent that
we are required to rebate travel booking fees we currently receive to travel
suppliers, and are unable to recover such amounts by charging customers, it
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

In July 2003, Worldspan was acquired by a corporation newly formed by
Citigroup Venture Capital Equity Partners L.P. and Teachers’ Merchant Bank. It
is unclear what effect, if any, this change in control of Worldspan, L.P. will
have on our relationship with Worldspan, L.P. or our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes

.

We file tax returns in such states as required by law based on
principles applicable to traditional businesses. In addition, we pay sales and
other taxes to suppliers on our purchases of travel services sold


through
the priceline.com service. In certain cases, where appropriate, we remit taxes
directly to the tax authorities. We believe that this practice is consistent
with the tax laws of all jurisdictions. However, one or more states could seek
to impose additional income tax obligations, sales tax collection obligations
or other tax obligations on companies, such as ours, which engage in or
facilitate online commerce. A number of proposals have been made at state and
local levels that could impose such taxes on the sale of products and services
through the Internet or the income derived from these sales.  To the extent that any tax authority succeeds
in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions
conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have additional tax
exposure.  Such actions could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We will continue to assess the risks of the
potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent
appropriate, we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

Current economic conditions in the United States are triggering active
consideration on ways to generate additional tax revenues by both the federal
and state and local governments. We cannot predict what changes in tax law or
interpretations of such laws may be adopted or assure that such changes or
interpretations would not materially impact our business.

Our business is exposed to risks associated
with credit card fraud and charge-backs.

To date, our results have been negatively impacted by purchases made
using fraudulent credit cards. Because we act as the merchant-of-record in a
majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent
credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our
customers. Additionally, we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit
cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of
record.  Accordingly, we calculate and
record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs. Beginning
in the second half of 2001, we launched a company-wide credit card charge-back
reduction project aimed at preventing the acceptance of fraudulent credit
cards.  This project has been expanded
to encompass retail transactions.  To
date, we have been successful in reducing fraud; however, if we are unable to
continue to reduce the use of fraudulent credit cards on our website, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

Fluctuations in our financial results make
quarterly comparisons and financial forecasting difficult.

Our revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter
to quarter because our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, which
reflect seasonal trends for the travel products offered by our website.
Traditional leisure travel bookings are higher in the first two calendar
quarters of the year in anticipation of spring and summer vacations and holiday
periods, but online travel reservations may decline with reduced Internet usage
during the summer months. In the last two quarters of the calendar year, demand
for travel products generally declines and the number of bookings flattens. Our
results may also be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the inventory made
available to us by airlines, hotels and rental car suppliers. Our revenues and
operating results may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter
because of these factors. As a result, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our
revenues and operating results may not be meaningful. In addition, due to our
limited operating history, a relatively new and unproven business model and an
uncertain environment in the travel industry, it may be difficult to predict
our future revenues or results of operations.

Because of these fluctuations and uncertainties, our operating results
may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this
happens, the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly be
materially adversely affected.

If we lose our key personnel or cannot
recruit additional personnel, our business may suffer.

We depend on the continued services and performance of our executive
officers and other key personnel. These individuals have acquired specialized
knowledge and skills with respect to priceline.com


and
our operations. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. Our
ability to retain key employees could be materially adversely affected by the
decline in the market price of our common stock, limitations on our ability to
pay cash compensation that is equivalent to cash paid by traditional businesses
and limitations imposed by our employee benefit plans on our ability to issue
additional equity incentives. If we do not succeed in attracting new employees
or retaining and motivating current and future employees or executive officers,
our business could suffer significantly.

We rely on the
value of the priceline.com brand, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing
our

brand awareness are increasing.

We believe that maintaining and expanding the priceline.com brand, and
other owned brands, including Lowestfare.com and rentalcars.com, are important
aspects of our efforts to attract and expand our user and advertiser base.  As our larger competitors spend increasingly
more on advertising, we are required to spend more in order to maintain our
brand recognition.  Promotion of the
priceline.com brand will depend largely on our success in satisfying our
customers. In addition, we have spent considerable money and resources to date
on the establishment and maintenance of the priceline.com brands, and we will
continue to spend money on, and devote resources to advertising, marketing and
other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness
of the priceline.com brands. We may not be able to successfully maintain or
enhance consumer awareness of the priceline.com brands, and, even if we are
successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective. If
we are unable to maintain or enhance customer awareness of the priceline.com
brands in a cost-effective manner, our business, results of operations and
financial condition would be adversely affected.

Online security
breaches could harm our business.

The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet
is essential in maintaining consumer and supplier confidence in the
priceline.com service. Substantial or ongoing security breaches whether
instigated internally or externally on our system or other Internet-based
systems could significantly harm our business. We currently require buyers to
guarantee their offers with their credit card, either online or through our
toll-free telephone service. We rely on licensed encryption and authentication
technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including
credit card numbers. It is possible that advances in computer capabilities, new
discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the
technology used by us to protect customer transaction data.

We incur substantial expense to protect against and remedy security
breaches and their consequences. However, we cannot guarantee that our security
measures will prevent security breaches. A party that is able to circumvent our
security systems could steal proprietary information or cause significant
interruptions in our operations. For instance, several major websites have
experienced significant interruptions as a result of improper direction of
excess traffic to those sites, and computer viruses have substantially
disrupted e-mail and other functionality in a number of countries, including
the United States. Security breaches also could damage our reputation and
expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance
policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us
for losses caused by security breaches.

We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third
parties conducting business over the Internet. Consumers generally are
concerned with security and privacy on the Internet, and any publicized
security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet and, therefore, the
priceline.com service as a means of conducting commercial transactions.

Two large stockholders beneficially own
approximately 34% of our stock.

Hutchison Whampoa Limited and its 49.97% shareholder, Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Limited, collectively beneficially owned approximately 34% of our
outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2003, based on public filings
with the SEC. Together, Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited and Hutchison


Whampoa
Limited have appointed three of the twelve members of our Board of Directors.
As a result of their ownership and positions, Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited
and Hutchison Whampoa Limited collectively are able to significantly influence
all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors
and approval of significant corporate transactions. Such concentration of
ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control
of our company. In addition, both Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited and Hutchison
Whampoa Limited have registration rights with respect to their shares of
priceline.com. On September 19, 2001, Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited and
Hutchison Whampoa Limited withdrew a request they had made for us to
file a shelf registration statement to sell shares and obtained rights to
purchase up to a 37.5% stake (on a fully diluted basis) in priceline.com,
subject to certain limitations. There can be no assurance that Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Limited, Hutchison Whampoa Limited, or both, will not make another
request for registration and dispose of all or substantially all of our common
stock held by them at any time after the effectiveness of a shelf registration
statement. Sales of significant amounts of shares held by Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Limited or Hutchison Whampoa Limited, or the prospect of these
sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

We rely on third-party systems.

We rely on certain third-party computer systems and third-party
service providers, including the computerized central reservation systems of
the airline, hotel and rental car industries to satisfy demand for airline
tickets and hotel room reservations. In particular, our travel business is
substantially dependent upon the computerized reservation system of Worldspan,
L.P., an operator of a database for the travel industry. Any interruption in
these third-party services systems, including Worldspan, L.P.’s system,
or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking airline,
hotel and rental car reservations and have a material adverse effect on our
business. Our agreements with third-party service providers are
terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service
interruptions. In the event our arrangement with any of such third parties is
terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support
on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms and, as a result, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Substantially all of our computer hardware for operating our services is
currently located at a web hosting facility operated by Cable &
Wireless.  Cable & Wireless recently
announced that it intends to sell the web hosting portion of its business to
SAVVIS Communications Corporation.  If
the transition of the facility to SAVVIS is executed without proper
disciplines, or if they are for any reason unable to support our web site, we
would need to quickly complete the activation of our secondary site at the ATT
web hosting facility.  Any of these
conditions could cause disruptions to our business, exposure to potentially damaging
press coverage of the problems, and the acceleration of our build out of the
ATT data center would have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, and financial condition.

Some of our communications infrastructure is provided by
WorldCom, Inc., which currently does business under the MCI brand name and
has filed for bankruptcy protection. If MCI is unable, for any reason, to
support the communications infrastructure that it provides us, instabilities in
our systems could increase until such time as we were able to replace its
services.

While we do maintain redundant systems and hosting services, it is
possible that we could experience an interruption in our business, and we do
not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for
losses that may occur.

Capacity constraints and system failures
could harm our business.

We rely on the global distribution system of Worldspan, L.P. in the sale
of airline tickets, opaque hotel room reservations, and rental car
reservation.  We do not have a back-up
GDS and if Worldspan GDS becomes inaccessible, or partially inaccessible to us,
due to system failure or otherwise, for any significant amount of time,


our
ability to book airline tickets, opaque hotel reservations and rental car
reservations would be adversely affected, and our results would suffer.

A substantial amount of our computer hardware for operating our services
is currently located at the facilities of Cable & Wireless plc in New
Jersey. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption
from human error, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures and
similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts
of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite any precautions we may take, the
occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the
Cable & Wireless facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our
services. In addition, the failure by Cable & Wireless to provide our
required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our
service. Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases
the responsiveness of the priceline.com service could impair our reputation,
damage our brand name and have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

If our systems cannot be expanded to cope with increased demand or fails
to perform, we could experience:

•

unanticipated
disruptions in service;

•

slower response
times;

•

decreased
customer service and customer satisfaction; or

•

delays in the
introduction of new products and services,

any
of which could impair our reputation, damage the priceline.com brand and
materially and adversely affect our revenues. Publicity about a service
disruption also could cause a material decline in our stock price.

Like many online businesses, we have experienced system failures from
time to time. For example, in May 2001, our primary website was
interrupted for a period of 12 hours. In addition to placing increased
burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of
user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support
personnel. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an
immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial and may cause some users to
switch to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system
failures, our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed. We have been
taking steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system. These
steps are expensive, may reduce our margins and may not be successful in
reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.

We use internally developed systems to operate the priceline.com
service, including transaction processing and order management systems that
were designed to be scaleable. However, if the number of users of the
priceline.com service increases substantially, we will need to significantly
expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network
infrastructure. We do not know whether we will be able to accurately project
the rate or timing of any such increases, or expand and upgrade our systems and
infrastructure to accommodate such increases in a timely manner.

Our success depends on our ability to protect
our intellectual property.

We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success, and we
rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and
confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers,
partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. If we are not successful
in protecting our intellectual property, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.


While we believe that our issued patents and pending patent applications
help to protect our business, there can be no assurance that:

•

any patent can
be successfully defended against challenges by third parties;

•

pending patent
applications will result in the issuance of patents;

•

competitors or
potential competitors of priceline.com will not devise new methods of competing
with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications;

•

because of
variations in the application of our business model to each of our products and
services, our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third parties
from utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same product or service in
one or more categories;

•

new prior art
will not be discovered which may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued
patent; or

•

a third party
will not have or obtain one or more patents that prevent us from practicing
features of our business or require us to pay for a license to use those
features.

There has been recent discussion in the press regarding the examination
and issuance of so called “business-method” patents. As a result, the
United States Patent and Trademark Office has indicated that it intends to
intensify the review process applicable to such patent applications. The new
procedures are not expected to have a direct effect on patents already granted.
We cannot anticipate what effect, if any, the new review process will have on
our pending patent applications.

We pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in the
U.S. and internationally. However, effective trademark, service mark, copyright
and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our
services are made available online. We have licensed in the past, and expect to
license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or
copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take actions that
might diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.

Legal Proceedings

We are a party to the legal proceedings described in Note 17 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003.  The defense of the actions described in Note 17 may increase our
expenses and an adverse outcome in any of such actions could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may not be able to keep up with rapid
technological and other changes.

The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new service
and product announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing consumer
demands. We may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes. In addition,
these market characteristics are heightened by the emerging nature of the
Internet and the apparent need of companies from many industries to offer
Internet-based products and services. As a result, our future success
will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt
our services to evolving industry standards and to continually improve the
performance, features and reliability of our service in response to competitive
service and product offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace. In
addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or


telecommunications
technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur
substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure.

Our stock price is highly volatile.

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to
continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the
following, some of which are beyond our control:

•

quarterly
variations in our operating results;

•

operating
results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;

•

changes in
expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial
estimates by securities analysts and investors;

•

changes in our
capital structure;

•

changes in
market valuations of other Internet or online service companies;

•

announcements of
technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;

•

announcements by
us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic
partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

•

loss of a major
supplier participant, such as an airline or hotel chain;

•

changes in the
status of our intellectual property rights;

•

lack of success
in the expansion of our business model geographically;

•

announcements by
third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us or adverse
developments in pending proceedings;

•

additions or
departures of key personnel; and

•

stock market
price and volume fluctuations.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could
adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing a large
number of sellers to the market. Given the volatility that exists for our
shares, such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline
significantly. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our
price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum,
hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks
rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when
viewed on a quarterly basis.

The trading prices of Internet company stocks in general, including
ours, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. To the extent
that the public’s perception of the prospects of Internet or e-commerce
companies is negative, our stock price could decline further, regardless of our
results. Other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price
of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Market
fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as a
recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, also may decrease the
market price of our common stock. The market value of e-commerce stocks has
declined dramatically recently


based
on profitability and other concerns. Negative market conditions could adversely
affect our ability to raise additional capital.

We are defendants in a number of securities class action litigations. In
the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a
company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities.
To the extent our stock price declines or is volatile, we may in the future be
the target of additional litigation. This additional litigation could result in
substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.

Regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm
our business.

The products and services we offer through the priceline.com service are
regulated by federal and state governments. Our ability to provide such
products and services is and will continue to be affected by such regulations.
The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of
existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur
significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected markets to
become impractical and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

approximately 12,000 square feet of leased office and warehouse space.  We also have a lease for approximately 2,500
square feet of office space in New York City. Priceline.com europe Ltd. leases
approximately 290 square feet of office space in Staines, England. We do not
own any real estate as of March 1, 2004.

Item 3.  Legal
Proceedings

On
January 6, 1999, we received notice that a third party patent applicant
and patent attorney, Thomas G. Woolston, purportedly had filed in
December 1998 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office a request
to declare an interference between a patent application filed by Woolston and
the Company’s U.S. Patent 5,794,207.  We
are currently awaiting information from the Patent Office regarding whether it
will initiate an interference proceeding.

Subsequent to our announcement on September 27, 2000 that revenues for
the third quarter 2000 would not meet expectations, we were served with the

All of these cases have been assigned to Judge Dominick J.
Squatrito.  On September 12, 2001, Judge
Squatrito ordered that these cases be consolidated under the Master File No.
3:00cv1884 (DJS), and he designated lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs’
counsel.  On October 29, 2001,
plaintiffs served a Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On February 5, 2002, Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc., who is
one of the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action, made a motion for leave
to withdraw as lead plaintiff.  The
court has yet to rule on that motion. 
On February 28, 2002, we filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated
Amended Complaint.  That motion has been
fully briefed.  The Court has yet to
rule on that motion.  On July 26 and
August 1, 2002, the Court issued scheduling orders concerning pretrial
proceedings.  We intend to defend
vigorously against this action.  We are
unable to predict the outcome of these suits or reasonably estimate a range of
possible loss, if any.

In addition, on November 1, 2000 we were served with a complaint that
purported to be a shareholder derivative action against its Board of Directors
and certain of its current and former executive officers, as well as the
Company (as a nominal defendant).  The
complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets.  The action is captioned Mark Zimmerman v.
Richard Braddock, J. Walker, D. Schulman, P. Allaire, R. Bahna, P. Blackney, W.
Ford, M. Loeb, N. Nicholas, N. Peretsman, and priceline.com Incorporated
18473-NC (Court of Chancery of Delaware, County of New Castle, State of
Delaware).  On February 6, 2001, all
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to make a demand upon the
Board of Directors and failure to state a cause of action upon which relief can
be granted.  Pursuant to a stipulation
by the parties, an amended complaint was filed on June 21, 2001.  Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss
on August 20, 2001, and plaintiff served his opposition to that motion on
October 26, 2001.  Defendants filed
their reply brief on January 7, 2002. 
On December 20, 2002, the Court granted Defendants’ motion without
prejudice.  On April 25, 2003, a second
amended complaint, adding H. Miller, was filed and a motion seeking leave of
court to file the second amended complaint was filed on July 28, 2003.  Defendants filed their opposition to that
motion on October 31, 2003.  Plaintiff
filed his reply brief on January 22, 2004. 
We intend to defend vigorously against this action.  We are unable to predict the outcome of the
suit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

On March 16, March 26, April 27, and June 5, 2001, respectively, four
putative class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York naming priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock,
Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as defendants (01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ.
3590 and 01 Civ. 4956).  Shives

et al

. v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

., 01 Civ. 4956, also names other
defendants and states claims unrelated to us. 
The complaints allege, among other things, that priceline.com and the
individual defendants violated the federal securities laws by issuing and
selling priceline.com common stock in priceline.com’s March 1999 initial public
offering without disclosing to investors that some of the underwriters in the
offering, including the lead underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received
excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors.  By Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge
Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these cases were consolidated for pre-trial
purposes with hundreds of other cases, which contain allegations concerning the
allocation of shares in the initial public offerings of companies other than
priceline.com, Inc.  By Order of Judge
Scheindlin dated August 14, 2001, the following cases were consolidated for all
purposes:  01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576;
and 01 Civ. 3590.  On April 19, 2002,
plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these
cases.  This


Consolidated Amended Class
Action Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with
respect to both our March 1999 initial public offering and our August 1999
second public offering of common stock. 
The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay
S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman, Timothy G. Brier, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson Stephens, Inc. (as successor-in-interest to
BancBoston), Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. (as successor-in-interest to
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.), Allen & Co., Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  Priceline,
Richard Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier,
together with other issuer defendants in the consolidated litigation, filed a
joint motion to dismiss on July 15, 2002. 
On November 18, 2002, the cases against the individual defendants were
dismissed without prejudice and without costs. 
In addition, counsel for plaintiffs and the individual defendants
executed Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements, which toll the statutes
of limitations on plaintiffs’ claims against those individuals.  On February 19, 2003, Judge Scheindlin
issued an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part the issuer’s
motion.  None of the claims against us
were dismissed.  On June 26, 2003,
counsel for the plaintiff class announced that they and counsel for the issuers
had agreed to the form of a Memorandum of Understanding to settle claims
against the issuers.  The terms of that
Memorandum provide that class members will be guaranteed $1 billion dollars in
recoveries by the insurers of the issuers and that settling issuer defendants
will assign to the class members certain claims that they may have against the
underwriters.  Issuers also agree to
limit their abilities to bring certain claims against the underwriters.  If recoveries in excess of $1 billion
dollars are obtained by the class from any non-settling defendants, the
settling defendants’ monetary obligations to the class plaintiffs will be
satisfied; any amount recovered from the underwriters that is less than $1
billion will be paid by the insurers on behalf of the issuers.  The Memorandum, which is subject to the
approval of each issuer, was approved by a special committee of the
priceline.com Board of Directors on Thursday, July 3, 2003.  Any proposed settlement is subject to the
parties entering into a formal written agreement and final approval by the
Court.

On November 7, 2003, we were served with a complaint that purported to
be a shareholder derivative action against its Board of Directors and certain
of its current and former executive officers, as well as priceline.com (as a
nominal defendant).  The complaint
alleged, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate
assets and misappropriation of corporate information.  The claims in the complaint appear to be substantially repetitive
of the claims pending in the derivative action in Delaware described
above.  The action is captioned Don
Powell v. Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Daniel H. Schulman, Paul A.
Allaire, Ralph M. Bahna, Paul J. Blackney, William E. Ford, Marshall Loeb, N.
J. Nicholas, Jr., Nancy B. Peretsman, and Heidi G. Miller and priceline.com
Incorporated (Superior Court, Judicial District of Stamford/Norwalk, State of
Connecticut).  On January 21, 2004,
defendants moved to stay the case pending the outcome of the derivative action in
Delaware.  That motion was denied on January
26, 2004.  On January 28, 2004,
defendants Blackney, Nicholas, Peretsman and Loeb moved to dismiss the
complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
Defendant Miller moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction on January 29, 2004.  On
February 27, 2004, defendants Braddock, Walker, Schulman, Miller and
priceline.com moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction and defendants Braddock and Schulman also moved to dismiss the
complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
We intend to defend vigorously against this action.  We are unable to predict the outcome of this
suit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

On November 24, 2003, priceline.com was served with a complaint for
patent infringement captioned

IMX, Inc. v.
E-Loan, Inc., InteractiveCorp, LendingTree, Inc. and priceline.com Incorporated

.  The complaint alleges, among other things,
that priceline.com has infringed, induced others to infringe and/or committed
acts of contributory infringement of U.S. patent number 5,995,947 entitled
“Interactive Mortgage and Loan Information and Real-Time Trading Systems.”  The complaint seeks injunctive relief;
unspecified money damages; an order directing defendants to pay IMX’s costs and
attorneys’ fees; and an award of pre-and post-judgment interest.  We intend to defend vigorously against this
action.  On January 23, 2004, we
answered the complaint, denying IMX’s allegations, and filed a counterclaim,
which seeks a declaration that the patent-in-suit is invalid and/or that we do
not infringe any claim of the patent and that


we do not contribute to or
induce the infringement of any claim of the patent.  We are unable at this time to predict the outcome of this suit or
reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

From
time to time, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to legal
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of
alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights by it.  Such claims, even if not meritorious, could
result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Uncertainty
regarding payment of sales and hotel occupancy and other related taxes — We are
currently conducting a review and interpretation of the tax laws in various
states and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state and local hotel
occupancy and other related taxes.  In
connection with our review, we have met and had discussions with taxing
authorities in certain jurisdictions but the ultimate resolution in any
particular jurisdiction cannot be determined at this time.  Currently, hotels collect and remit hotel
occupancy and related taxes to the various tax authorities based on the amounts
collected by the hotels.  Consistent
with this practice, we recover the taxes on the underlying cost of the hotel
room night from customers and remit the taxes to the hotel operators for
payment to the appropriate tax authorities. 
Several jurisdictions have indicated that they may take the position
that hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price
paid by a customer for our service and the cost to us of the underlying
room.  Historically, we have not
collected taxes on this differential. 
Some state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to
sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect
such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively or both.  Such actions may result in substantial
liabilities for past sales and could have a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations.  To
the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that such a tax
collection responsibility exists, it is likely that, with respect to future
transactions, we would collect any such additional tax obligation from its
customers, which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room
nights to our customers and, consequently, could reduce its hotel sales.  We will continue to assess the risks of the
potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent
appropriate, it will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

PART II

Item 5.  Market
for the Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters

Price Range of Common Stock

Our
common stock has been quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
“PCLN” since our initial public offering on March 29, 1999. Prior to such time,
there was no public market for our common stock. The following table sets
forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low closing sales prices per
share of the common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, adjusted
to take into account the one-for-six reverse stock split implemented in June
2003:

Holders

As
of March 1, 2004, there were approximately 1,199 stockholders of record of
priceline.com’s common stock, although we believe that there are a
significantly larger number of beneficial owners.

Dividend Policy

We
have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock since our inception
and do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We
currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of
our business. Under the terms of the certificate of designation relating to our
Series B Preferred Stock, we cannot issue any dividends on shares of our common
stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on the Series B Preferred
Stock for all dividend periods ending on or prior to the proposed date of
payment of a dividend on our common stock.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

Issuance of Convertible Notes

In
August 2003, we issued, in a private placement, $125 million aggregate
principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an
interest rate of 1%.  The initial
purchasers of the notes were Goldman Sachs & Co. and Thomas Weisel Partners
LLC.  We intend to use the net proceeds
of the offering for general corporate purposes, strategic purposes and working
capital requirements.  The


notes
are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into our common stock, par
value $0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of
approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events.  Each $1,000 principal
amount of notes will initially be convertible into 25 shares of our common
stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the closing price of our common stock
for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the
first day of a conversion period, as defined in the offering memorandum related
to the notes, is more than 110% of the then current conversion price of the
notes, or after August 1, 2008, the closing price of our common stock is more
than 110% of the then current conversion price of the notes.  The notes are also convertible in certain
other circumstances set forth in the offering memorandum, such as a change in
control of priceline.com.  In addition,
the notes will be redeemable at our option beginning in 2008, and the holders
may require us to repurchase the notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other
circumstances.  Interest on the notes is
payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year.  We filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 for the resale of
the notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes,
and the SEC declared the Registration Statement to be effective on January 29,
2004.  The SEC assigned the Registration
Statement file number 333-109929.

In
connection with the Convertible Senior Notes, in November 2003, we entered into
an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts the interest on
approximately $45 million of our debt from a fixed rate to a variable rate.

Issuance of Warrants

In
March 2003, in connection with the renewal of a marketing agreement with
Marriott International, Inc., we issued Marriott 833,333 warrants to purchase
shares of our common stock at $9.84 per share. 
The warrants, which are not transferable, are fully vested,
non-forfeitable, and will be exercisable no earlier than three years from the
date of issuance (subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a
reorganization, recapitalization, merger or consolidation involving
priceline.com).  In connection with the
issuance of the warrants, we recorded a charge in the first quarter of 2003 of
approximately $6.6 million, or $(0.17) of earnings per share.

On
January 29, 2002, Delta Air Lines, Inc. notified us that they were exercising
warrants to purchase 666,667 shares of priceline.com common stock. The warrants
were issued to Delta in February 2001 in connection with Delta’s exchange of
priceline.com Series A Convertible Redeemable PIK Preferred Stock for Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock. As required by the terms of the warrants, Delta
exercised the warrants by surrendering 11,875 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock. As a result, on January 29, 2002, after giving effect to the exercise of
the warrants, there were 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding
having an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $13.5 million. As a
result of this exercise, the Series B Preferred Stock will pay dividends of
approximately 40,333 shares of priceline.com common stock semi-annually. In
connection with the sale of the shares issued upon exercise of the warrants, we
relied upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. See Note 13
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

issued to Marriott during 2003.

The 1997 Plan and the 1999 Plan each provide for the granting of awards to officers, other employees, consultants and directors of the Company and its affiliates.  Awards may be made in the form of stock options, restricted stock or other awards.  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the 1997 Plan and the 1999 Plan is currently 3,979,166 and 5,895,833 shares, respectively (subject to adjustment as provided in the respective plans).  Options issued under the 1997 Plan and the 1999 Plan generally become exercisable in equal installments over a three-year term and expire ten years after the date of grant.  All stock options issued under the 1999 Plan must have an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant.

The 2000 Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to employees and consultants of the Company and its affiliates.

All options issued under the 2000 Plan must have an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant.

In February 2000, the Company adopted a plan (the “Miller Plan”), pursuant to which it authorized the issuance of options to acquire 416,666 shares of the Company’s common stock to Heidi G. Miller, the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer.  The Company actually granted 270,833 options under the Miller Plan, of which all were subsequently forfeited, and not available for issuance to anyone other than Ms. Miller.

Pursuant to the Mylod Option, Mr. Mylod has the right to acquire up to 83,333 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $14.63 per share.  The Mylod Option is fully vested and is exercisable until November 19, 2010.

The Delta Warrants provide for an exercise price of $17.82 per share and Delta may exercise the Delta Warrants only by surrendering shares of the Company’s Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock.  If, however, the closing sales price of the Company’s Common Stock has exceeded $53.46 (subject to adjustment) for 20 consecutive trading days, the Delta Warrants will automatically be exercised.  In such event, the exercise price will be paid by surr
endering shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock.  The Delta Warrants are exercisable at any time prior to February 6, 2007.  Please see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Delta Warrants.

Overview

General

.  We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers
a broad range of travel products, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car
rentals, vacation packages and cruises. 
Our unique

Name Your Own Price

®

system — which allows our customers to make offers for travel products at
prices they set — enables our customers to use the Internet to save money on
travel products and services while enabling sellers, which include many of the
major domestic airline, hotel and rental car companies, to generate incremental
revenue.  In 2003, we complemented our

Name Your Own Price

®

product
offering by giving our customers the ability to purchase certain travel
products in a more traditional, price-disclosed manner.  At present, we derive substantially all of
our revenues from the following sources:

•

revenues from
the sale of

airline
tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars;

•

Reservation
booking fees from Worldspan, L.P. in connection with the sale of

•

Trends

.

Our overall
financial prospects have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon
our sale of leisure airline tickets and, as a result, the health of our
business has been directly related to the health of the airline industry.  While the domestic airline industry has
experienced significant revenue declines since September of 2001, the online
travel sector, overall, continues to grow, and we believe the opportunity
exists for us to broaden our participation in that growth.  Nonetheless, most domestic airlines, and
many of our major suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience,
significant losses, which, in many cases, worsened as a result of the war in
Iraq and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, in 2003.  In addition, these problems have been
compounded by competition from low-cost carriers and uncertainty regarding our
domestic economy.  As a result, since
September of 2001, many of the major airlines have grounded portions of their
fleets, significantly reducing the number of available airline seats, and have
deeply discounted retail airline tickets to stimulate demand.  These actions have had, and continue to
have, a detrimental effect on our

Name Your
Own Price

®

airline ticket
business, which represents a significant portion of our total airline ticket
revenues.  Deep retail discounting by
the airlines negatively affects demand for our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline ticket
product because it hurts our value proposition and makes users less willing to


accept
the trade-offs associated with our product. 
In addition, decreased airline capacity hurts our business by reducing
the levels of inventory available to us and increasing our cost of inventory.  Customer offer prices have not kept pace
with the increase in our cost of inventory and are, therefore, lower in
proportion to our average cost of supply, which has, for the better part of the
last two years, materially and negatively affected the number of

Name Your Own Price

®

tickets we
sell.

In
an effort to counter some of the trends described above, we have taken a number
of initiatives to diversify our product offerings to lessen our reliance on the
sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets.  Over the past two years, we
have invested in and focused our marketing efforts on our non-airline travel
products, including, in particular, our hotel business.

We intend to continue to
develop our non-air business, in particular our hotel, rental car and vacation
package businesses, for which demand remains relatively strong, and continue to
evaluate and implement ways to improve the number of airline tickets we sell.

In
addition, we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our
revenue among non-opaque products, such as retail travel products, which we
believe will help broaden our customer appeal. 
To this end, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we began offering customers
the ability to purchase airline tickets at disclosed, retail prices.  Our intent is to permit customer maximum
flexibility by allowing them to select a retail itinerary or to make use of the

Name Your Own Price

®

product.

It
is too early for us to determine the impact that the launch of a retail airline
ticket product, or the related marketing effort, will have on our business
results.  However, the preliminary
results have been positive and we believe we are starting to make progress
towards stabilizing and growing total unit sales of airline tickets, which, as
discussed above, declined significantly over the past two years.

Based
on these preliminary results, the launch of a retail airline product has had a
positive effect on the overall number of airline tickets we sell.  While some customers presented with a
display of low disclosed prices may opt to select such a ticket or make a lower
offer for an

Name Your Own Price

®

ticket, we believe the gross profit contribution from the increased sale of
retail airline tickets has, to date, more than offset any loss in the number of

®

tickets sold.

terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East, the liquidation of a major
domestic airline now in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or
the withdrawal from our system of a major airline or hotel supplier, could
adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability
to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above.

Other

.  A number of travel suppliers, particularly
airlines, have indicated publicly that, as part of an effort to reduce
distribution costs, they intend to reduce their dependence over time on what
they view to be “expensive” distribution channels such as global distribution
systems (GDSs).  A number of travel
suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require rebates
of all or part of the fees received from the GDS.  Additionally, travel suppliers are encouraging distributors, such
as us, to develop technology enabling direct connections therefore bypassing
the GDS.  Development of direct connection
technology would require the use of information technology resources and could
cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other projects.  We have been and believe that we will
continue to be under pressure from travel suppliers to rebate all or part of
the travel booking fees we receive from Worldspan, L.P., our GDS.  To the extent that we are required to rebate
travel booking fees we currently receive from our GDS to travel suppliers, and
are unable to recover such amounts by charging customers, it could have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.  See “

Factors That May Affect Future Results

We
believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain
profitability, primarily from our leisure travel business, to continue to
promote the priceline.com brand and, over time, to offer other travel products
and services on our website. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and
promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts
to improve


operating
results. Our goal is to improve gross margins in an effort to achieve and
maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the
prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we
cannot assure you that we will achieve revenue growth and sustain
profitability.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are
based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting
policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of
operations and require us to make significant judgments. In applying those
policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate
assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an
on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to credit
card charge-backs and refunds, recoverability of our investments in licensees
and other, recoverability and useful lives of intangible assets, income and
other taxes, restructuring, special charges and severance, and contingencies
and litigation. Those estimates are based on historical experience, terms of
existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting
policies is set forth below.

•

Refunds.

In limited
circumstances, we make certain accommodations for customers or provide refunds
to customers. Based on our historical experience and our contractual
arrangements with our suppliers, we establish reserves for estimated losses
resulting from refunds or cancellations. In the event that we experience either
an unanticipated increase in refunds or cancellations, as we did in the weeks
following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or our suppliers refuse
to accept certain refunds or cancellations or challenge refunds granted outside
of their policies, our costs of revenues could increase.

•

Allowance
for Credit Card Charge-backs.

Because we act
as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions, we may be held
liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other
payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for
accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not
act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance
for the resulting credit card charge-backs. 
In the event we experience an unanticipated increase in fraudulent
transactions on our website, our sales and marketing expense could increase.

•

Investment
in Equity Interests

.  We have a
49% equity interest in pricelinemortgage and, accordingly, recognize our pro
rata share of pricelinemortgage’s net income. 
The carrying value of the investment at December 31, 2003 was $9.4
million.  Additionally, Lowestfare.com,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has an investment in Travelweb LLC
that represents approximately 14% of its outstanding equity.  The investment is accounted for under the
equity method of accounting.  At
December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the investment in Travelweb LLC was
$7.9 million.  We periodically test
these investments for impairment using a number of assumptions and
estimates.  In the event that future
circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we
could determine that some part or all of the carrying value of either of these investments
is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded.


•

Derivative
Financial Instruments

.  We
are exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our
Convertible Senior Notes. We use derivatives principally in the management of
interest rate exposure. We do not utilize derivatives that contain leverage
features. On the date on which we enter into a derivative, the derivative is
designated as a hedge of the identified exposure and we measure effectiveness
of our hedging relationships both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis.  In November 2003, we entered
into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we swapped the fixed 1% interest
on our Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010 for a floating interest rate
hedge based on the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable margin of
221 basis points, on $45 million notional value of debt.  We designated this interest rate swap
agreement as a fair value hedge and therefore changes in the fair value of the
interest rate swap agreement and the underlying debt are recorded as offsetting
gains and losses in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations.  In the event that future
interest rate relationships change significantly from those in effect today,
the swap could become ineffective as a hedge vehicle causing us to record
additional interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

•

Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles.

We evaluate whether events
or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of
long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The
significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review
include changes in business strategy, market conditions, or the manner of use
of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future
operating results; and negative industry or economic trends.  In evaluating an asset for possible
impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to
measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is
not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted
cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.  While we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are
reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially
affect these evaluations.

•

Tax
Valuation Allowance.

We recorded a
valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset at December
31, 2003 and 2002 representing the portion of tax operating loss carryforwards
and other items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such
items will not be realized.  At December
31, 2003 we had approximately $3 billion of net operating loss carryforwards
for income tax purposes expiring from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2021,
which are subject to limitation on future utilization under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  In the
event that future operations indicate that some or all of these deferred tax
benefits will be realized, we would recognize a tax provision credit for those
estimated future tax benefits in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The recognition of some or all of such
future tax benefits would involve a significant amount of judgment by
management.  In addition, the amount of
annual benefit available under Section 382 is based upon certain conclusions
pertaining to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of the Company
on the dates of the ownership changes. 
The overall determination of the annual Section 382 limitation is
subject to interpretation, and therefore, the annual loss limitation could be
subject to change.

•

Presentation
of Revenues.

Revenues are primarily recognized, if and when, we
accept and fulfill a customer’s offer. 
Merchant revenue, which represents a substantial majority of our overall
revenues, primarily represents the selling price of Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars. For these transactions, we
establish the price we will accept, have discretion in supplier selection,
purchase and take title to the particular product and are the merchant of
record. We record as revenue the amount


received from the customer, net of taxes, surcharges
and other fees.  Agency

revenues are
derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of
record and where the prices of our products are determined by third
parties.  We record these fees as
revenue, at the net amount we receive, with no associated cost of revenue.

•

Accounting
for State and Local Taxes

.  We
file tax returns in such states as required by law based on principles
applicable to traditional businesses. In addition, we pay sales and other taxes
to suppliers on our purchases of travel services sold through the priceline.com
service. In certain cases, where appropriate, we remit taxes directly to the
tax authorities.  We believe that this
practice is consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions.  However, one or more states could seek to
impose additional income tax obligations, sales tax collection obligations, or
other tax obligations on companies, such as ours, which engage in or facilitate
online commerce.  A number of proposals
have been made at state and local levels that could impose such taxes on the
sale of products and services through the Internet or the income derived from
such sales.  To the extent that any tax
authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to
transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have
additional tax exposure.  We will
continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional
tax exposure, and to the extent appropriate, we will reserve for those
estimates of liabilities.

•

Valuation
of Goodwill

.

We account for
goodwill in connection with our investment in priceline.com europe.  We performed the initial and final steps of
the transitional impairment test in 2002 in connection with our adoption of
Statements of Financial Accounting No. 142. 
There was no impairment resulting from the transitional impairment test,
however, subsequent changes in circumstances indicated that an impairment had
occurred and impairment losses were determined and reflected in “operating
loss” in our 2002 Consolidated Financial Statements.  Impairment testing performed during 2003 resulted in no
impairment.  We will periodically test
goodwill for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates.  In the event that future circumstances
indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine
that some part or all of the goodwill is impaired requiring an impairment charge
to be recorded.

Financial Presentation

During the first quarter of 2003, we enhanced our financial reporting
format.  In the past, we reported
revenue segmented between travel and other revenue, a format that was driven by
our pursuit of businesses outside of the travel industry.  With the repositioning of our long distance
and new car products in the fourth quarter of 2002, our ongoing plan to keep
our strategic focus on the online travel sector and our recent commitment to
compliment our core

Name Your Own Price

®

products by developing agency-based retail travel products, the decision was
made to provide revenue and gross profit reporting in three categories:
Merchant (encompassing substantially all of our

Name Your Own Price

®

travel services), Agency
(encompassing substantially all of our priced-disclosed retail services) and
Other (encompassing all remaining revenue, the largest component of which is
advertising revenue).  In the third
quarter 2003, we further enhanced our financial reporting format by adding two
additional operating expense line items, Personnel and Information
Technology.  We believe that the
addition of these line items, as well as the discontinuance of the Systems and
Business Development category, is more useful to readers of our financial
statements.  These reclassifications
have been made to prior years’ financial statements to conform to current year
presentation.

Starting with the fourth quarter 2003, we began reporting our metrics
in a new format that provides greater visibility into the operations of our
retail businesses.  We now combine
merchant and agency unit bookings for air, hotel and rental car services.  The format change reflects the increased
importance of agency unit sales to our operating results and gives a better
view into the full


scale of our operating
activities.  In connection with this
change in format, we stopped presenting “bind rate” and other related customer
metrics since we believe such data, which reflects sales of opaque products only,
 no longer presents a complete view of
our financial results or business trends. 
We continue to present 2002 and 2001 comparative data in the previous
format, as we believe such data was relevant in those periods.

In June 2003, our stockholders approved a one-for-six
reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split
was effected at 12:01 a.m. on June 16, 2003, and, as a result, our issued and
outstanding common stock was reduced from approximately 227.6 million to
approximately 37.9 million shares. The par value of the common stock was not
affected by the reverse stock split and remains at $0.008 per share.
Consequently, on our balance sheet, the aggregate par value of the issued
common stock was reduced by reclassifying the par value amount of the
eliminated shares of common stock to Additional Paid-in Capital. All per share
amounts and outstanding shares, including all common stock equivalents, have
been retroactively restated in the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented to
reflect the reverse stock split.

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2003 compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2002

Revenues

Revenues are derived substantially from the following sources:

•

Transaction revenues from the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars;

•

Reservation
booking fees from Worldspan, L.P. in connection with the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars;

•

Customer
processing fees charged in connection with the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars;

•

Travel
commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan reservation booking fees,
principally related to the sale of price disclosed airline tickets, cruises and
other travel services; and

•

Other revenues
derived primarily from advertising on our websites and fees for referring
customers to affiliates and others.

We classify our revenue into three categories:

•

Merchant
revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and
determine the price to be paid by the customer. Merchant revenues include the
selling price of the airline ticket, hotel room and rental car and are reported
on a gross basis.

•

Agency revenues
are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of
record and where the prices of our products are determined by third parties.
Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and
Worldspan reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts
received, without any associated cost of revenue.


•

Other revenues
derived primarily from advertising on our websites and fees we earn for
referring customers to pricelinemortgage for home financing services and from
AIG for travel related insurance.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we experienced a decrease in
total revenue of approximately $140 million primarily due to a decline in the
sale of merchant airline tickets, partially offset by the improved performance
of our hotel and rental car products. Additionally, we have experienced a shift
in our airline ticket business mix from a primarily merchant opaque model to
include a growing number of retail, price disclosed tickets. Because merchant
tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis,
revenues could decrease and gross profit will become an increasing important
measure of evaluating growth in our business.

The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days
sold were as follows:

Revenues
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of:
(1) merchant revenues; (2) agency revenues; and (3) other revenues.

Merchant Revenues

Merchant
revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and
determine the price to be paid by the customer.  Merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003
and 2002 consisted primarily of:  (1)
transaction revenues representing the selling price of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; (2) customer processing fees charged in
connection with the sale of

Name Your Own
Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and (3)
ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees for merchant
transactions only.

The
approximately $144 million decrease in merchant revenue for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 was primarily
attributable to the decrease in the number of

Name Your
Own Price

®

tickets sold, which was
partially offset by the improved performance of our

Name
Your Own Price

®

hotel and rental car
products.

We
believe that the decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold – and
the corresponding effect that decrease had on our overall merchant revenues
during the twelve months ended


December
31, 2003 – continued to be due primarily to the weak retail environment for
airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us.  In particular, we believe that lower retail
pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­offs
associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline product
in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates to purchase travel products
at the lower retail rates or from “low-cost” carriers without having to make
any trade-offs.  In addition, many
airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001, and upon the outbreak of war in Iraq and the
outbreak of SARS, thus decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we
believe reduced airline inventory available to us.

In addition, in the past, we have “subsidized”
certain

Name Your Own Price

®

offers to purchase merchant airline tickets by adding a variable amount to some
customers’ offers to increase the likelihood that such customers’ offers would
be successful.  These “subsidies” had
the effect of, among other things, increasing the number of merchant airline
tickets sold and our merchant revenues but at the expense of lower gross
margins.  At the end of 2002, we made
the strategic decision to reduce sales of subsidized airline tickets.  To this end, we reduced subsidies we have
historically applied to certain merchant airline ticket offers.  While this has had the effect of reducing
the number of merchant airline tickets sold and our revenue during 2003, it has
positively contributed to our gross profit and gross margin.

The
year-over-year decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold, and the
corresponding effect it had on our merchant revenue, was partially offset by
the increase in hotel room nights and rental car days sold in the twelve months
ended December 31, 2003.  We believe
that the increase in hotel room night sold during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002

was principally
driven by our emphasis on our hotel business, and specifically by the success
of our advertising campaign focused on our hotel product,

and the
competitive room inventory and pricing we receive from our hotel partners.  We believe the increase in rental car days
sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same
periods in 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our
rental car product, which we believe was driven by, among other things, an
increase in visits to our website as a result of our advertising, and an
overall increase in demand for leisure rental cars generally, improvements we
made to the presentation of our rental car product on our website and
improvement in the inventory and pricing we receive from our rental car
partners.

Agency Revenues

Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we
are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our products are
determined by third parties.  Agency
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted
primarily of: (1) processing fees and third-party supplier commissions related
to the sale of travel products including the sale of price disclosed airline
tickets, cruises and other travel services; and (2) ancillary fees, including
GDS reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed transactions.  Agency revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003 increased approximately 949% from the same period a year ago,
primarily as a result of our increased focus on the retail airline ticket and
rental car business and the resulting increase in travel commissions and
processing fees earned.

Other Revenues

Other
revenues during twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted
primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; (2) fees for referring customers to
pricelinemortgage for home financing services and to AIG for travel insurance
and in 2002 automobile services; (3) in 2002, transaction revenue from our long
distance phone service, which we repositioned in 2002; and (4) in 2002, license
fees from Hutchison-Priceline Limited.

Other
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 decreased approximately
46% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, primarily as a result of the
decrease in fees earned from our home financing service, and due to our
repositioning of our long distance phone service.


Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of Revenues

Cost of Merchant Revenues

.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, cost of
merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of airline tickets from
our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and
passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline
tickets; (2) the cost of hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of hotel occupancy
tax; and (3) the cost of rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable
taxes.  Cost of merchant revenues for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, decreased approximately 15%,
primarily due to a decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets, as discussed
above.

Cost of Agency Revenues

.  Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are
amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any.


Cost of Other Revenues

.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, cost of other
revenues consisted of the cost of long distance telephone service provided by
our suppliers.  For the twelve months
ended December 31, 2003, there were no such costs due to the repositioning of
our long distance telephone service in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Gross Profit

.

Total gross profit decreased for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31,
2002, by $12.4 million primarily as a result of the decrease in sales of
merchant airline tickets, described above. 
Partially offsetting the reduction in total gross profit was growth in
merchant hotel and rental car gross profit as well as an increase in agency
gross profit.  Total gross profit,
expressed as a percentage of total revenue, increased during the period ended
December 31, 2003 compared to the same period during 2002 as a result of an
ongoing shift in our business mix from primarily merchant opaque transactions,
reported on a gross basis, to include more retail agency transactions, recorded
on a net basis.  Because merchant
tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis,
gross profit will become an increasing important measure of evaluating growth
in our business.

The
following table represents the percentage of gross profit, by category, in
relation to total gross profit:

Merchant Gross Profit

.  Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost
of merchant revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, merchant
gross profit decreased from the same period in 2002, primarily due to the
continued weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline
inventory available to us, factors which are described in “Merchant Revenues,”
above, in more detail.  As discussed in
“Merchant Revenues” above, at the end of 2002, we strategically reduced
subsidies applied to certain

Name Your Own
Price

®

airline ticket sales.  While this resulted in a reduction


in
merchant revenues, the subsidy reduction positively affected our gross profit
and increased our gross margin.  We are
able to manage the level of gross margins by controlling the price at which we
will cause offers to be fulfilled.  Our
merchant gross margin in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased
over the same periods a year ago primarily as the result of a shift in mix of
our products from the sale of airline tickets to the sale of hotel room nights
and rental car days.

Agency Gross Profit

.  Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is
recorded net of agency costs, if any. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, agency gross profit
increased over the same period in 2002 due to an increase in the sale of
disclosed price airline tickets, rental cars and related fees and commissions.

Other Gross Profit

.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, other gross profit
decreased over the same period in 2002 as a result of decreases in fees earned
in connection with our long distance phone service and home financing services
and decrease in license fees from Hutchison-Priceline Limited.

Operating Expenses

Advertising

Advertising
expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and radio advertising; (2) online
and e-mail advertisements; and (3) agency fees, creative talent and production
costs for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003, advertising expenses decreased over the same periods in 2002
primarily due to a shift from primarily radio advertising to lower absolute
dollars spent on television advertising and partially offset by an increase in
production and creative talent fees.

We intend to continue to promote the priceline.com brand
aggressively in the first quarter 2004 and to devote our marketing resources to
the re-launch of our airline ticket product, as well as the continued support
of our hotel product.  We expect to
spend approximately $13 million to $15 million on advertising in the first
quarter 2004.

Sales and Marketing

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees
associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service
providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions for credit card
charge-backs.

For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2003, sales and marketing expenses, which are
variable in nature, decreased over the same periods in 2002 due to less


customer
transaction processed in which we acted as the merchant of record and the
realization of higher cost efficiencies in our call centers, partially offset
by an increase in credit card chargebacks.

Personnel

Personnel
expenses consist primarily of compensation to our personnel, including
salaries, bonuses, taxes and employee health benefits.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, personnel expenses decreased over the same periods in 2002 due to the
full-year effect of a reduction in headcount undertaken during our fourth
quarter 2002 restructuring, partially offset by an increase in employee bonus
expense.

General and Administrative

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) business insurance; (2)
fees for outside professionals; (3) occupancy expenses; and (4)
telecommunications costs. General and administrative expenses decreased during
the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the same periods in
2002 as a result of decreases in employment agency fees, taxes and stock based
compensation, partially offset by higher professional fees and premiums on our
Directors and Officers liability insurance policies.  General and administrative expenses were also impacted by the
favorable resolution of certain obligations, without which the year-over-year
reduction would have been approximately 5%.


Information Technology

Information
technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software
license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with
operating our Internet site; and (3) payments to outside contractors.

For the twelve months ended December
31, 2003, information technology expenses decreased over the same period in
2002 primarily as a result of cost efficiencies generated by cost savings
initiatives, additional capitalized development costs associated with the
launch of our retail products.  In
addition, Information Technology expenses were reduced by the favorable
settlement of certain vendor disputes related to data communications and telecom
expenses without which the year-over-year reduction would have been
approximately 23%.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation
and amortization expenses consist of: 
(1) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (2)
depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of our leasehold
improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization
of our intangible assets with determinable lives.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and
amortization expense decreased over the same periods in 2002, primarily as a
result of a smaller depreciable asset base and a reduction in capital
expenditures in 2003.

Restructuring, Severance, and
Special Charges

In
the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately
$564,000.  This restructuring charge
resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of our estimated real estate costs
related to leased property vacated in connection with the 2002 and 2000
restructurings.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately
$4.7 million.  This restructuring charge
resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel businesses and a reduction in
headcount.  The repositioning was
designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel
business.  The charge relates primarily
to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments.

As
a result of the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, our work force was reduced
by 59 full-time employees at our Norwalk location and 4 full-time employees at
our Europe location.  The employee


termination
costs primarily represent severance payments and related benefits.  The real estate costs primarily represent
the estimated net lease expense related to space we decided we no longer
needed, and which we will not utilize in the future along with certain required
refurbishments to that space.  Asset
impairments are comprised of abandoned equipment and software projects, and
software costs related to our plans not to pursue certain product offerings and
activities.  Other restructuring charges
include professional and other fees and costs incurred in 2002 associated with
the restructuring activities.

In
the second quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors announced that Richard S.
Braddock had been reappointed as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Braddock replaced
Daniel H. Schulman, our prior President and Chief Executive Officer. In
connection with Mr. Schulman’s separation, we recorded a severance charge of
$5.4 million in the second quarter of 2001. This severance charge resulted from
the forgiveness of outstanding loans to Mr. Schulman and the payment of
severance, all of which was required by the terms of Mr. Schulman’s employment
agreement. We also accelerated, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Schulman’s
employment agreement, the vesting of 2,000,000 shares of restricted common
stock and 1,000,000 shares underlying stock options granted to Mr. Schulman,
resulting in a charge of approximately $770,000. The balance due to Mr.
Schulman ($345,000) was paid in the second quarter 2002.

In
the first quarter of 2001, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately
$1.4 million. This restructuring charge related primarily to the reduction of
our workforce by approximately 25 full-time employees in February 2001. The
charge relates primarily to severance payments and the entire amount of the
charge was disbursed in 2001.

The components and the annual activity related to the restructuring
charges for the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, were as follows (in
thousands):


During 2003 and 2002, we decreased the liability for the restructuring
charge by approximately $753,000 and approximately $916,000, respectively.  These reductions resulted from the favorable
resolution of certain matters, primarily the collection of certain receivables
and the settlement of real estate commitments, and were reflected as an
adjustment to the “Restructuring charge (reversal)” line on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

We estimate, based on current available information, the remaining net
cash outflows associated with our restructuring related commitments will be as
follows (in thousands):

Restructuring related liabilities due within 12 months and due after 12
months are classified in “Accrued expenses” and in “Other long-term
liabilities”, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Impairment Charge

During the third quarter of 2002, we performed impairment tests and
determined that the carrying amount of goodwill of $22.5 million related to our
European operations exceeded its implied fair value by approximately $12
million and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of $12 million. The fair
value was determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including
the market value of comparable companies (including revenue multiple
methodology) and discounted cash flow. Underlying the impairment was a
continued decline in the market value of priceline.com’s common stock, which we
review quarterly as an indicator of possible impairment of priceline.com europe
Ltd.’s carrying value, a deterioration in priceline.com europe Ltd.’s operations
caused primarily by increasingly competitive conditions among European online
travel companies and a decision in the third quarter of 2002 to reconfigure
product offerings.

During the third quarter of 2002 we performed a periodic evaluation of
the progress of the operations of Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Factors
including increasing negative variances in key operating metrics such as
negative gross margins and continuing operating losses, negative net asset
position and an increasingly competitive operating environment led us to
determine that the carrying


value of our convertible note
no longer reflected its fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment
charge of approximately $12.2 million. 
Estimated fair value was determined using cash flow estimates and a
review of the market value of comparable companies including the consideration
of the decline in our market value and through discussion with third party
valuation specialists.

Warrant Charge

The
warrant charge for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, related to the
issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to Marriott
International, Inc.

Interest

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, interest income on cash
and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2002 due to lower
interest rates.  Interest income was
also partially offset by interest expense, including amortization of debt
issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of our $125 million
aggregate principal amount Convertible Senior Notes.  Interest on the notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each
year.

Equity in Income of Investees, net

Equity in income of
investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 of $2.3 million,
represented our pro rata share of the net income of pricelinemortgage and, in
2003, our pro rata share of the net loss of Travelweb, LLC.


Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2002 compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2001.

Revenues

Revenues
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of:
(1) merchant revenues; (2) agency revenues; and (3) other revenues.

Merchant Revenues.

Merchant revenues are derived from
transactions where we are the merchant of record and determine the price to be
paid by the customer.  Merchant revenues
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of:  (1) transaction revenues representing the
selling price of

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; (2) ancillary fees, including
Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees for merchant transactions only; and
(3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars.

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we sold approximately 2.9 million,
4.1 million and 2.8 million airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car
days, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, we sold
approximately 4.5 million, 2.8 million and 3.1 million airline tickets, hotel
room nights and rental car days, respectively. 
We believe that the approximately 36% decrease in the number of airline
tickets sold in the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 compared to the
twelve months ended December 31, 2001 was due primarily to the weak retail
environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us.
In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might
normally be willing to make the trade­off associated with our products in
exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel products at
the lower retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs.
In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath
of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thus decreasing capacity on
existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us.

Our
“bind” rate is the percentage of unique offers that we ultimately fulfill.  Our “bind rate” for all unique airline
ticket, hotel room and rental car offers were as follows:


We
believe that our merchant revenues and bind rate have been negatively impacted
by the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline
inventory available to us. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing
causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­off associated
with our products in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to
purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from low-cost carriers
without having to make any trade-offs. In addition, many airlines grounded
portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September
11, 2001, thus decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we believe
reduced airline inventory available to us. These trends, which negatively
impacted our revenues and bind rate in the fourth quarter of 2001, and
throughout 2002.

We
added approximately 3.4 million new customers during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2002, compared to approximately 3.7 million during 2001. In
addition, we generated approximately 6.6 million repeat customer offers during
the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, compared to approximately 5.9
million for the same period last year.

Merchant
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 decreased approximately
14% to $996 million from approximately $1.2 billion for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2001, primarily as a result of the weak retail environment for
airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us. In particular,
we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be
willing to make the trade­off associated with our products in exchange for
savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel products at the lower
retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs.
In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath
of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thus decreasing capacity on
existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us.

Ancillary
fee revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 decreased from the
same period a year ago as a result of a decrease in Worldspan, L.P. reservation
booking fees and customer processing fees in the airline and rental car
services.

The
average revenue per total booked travel offer decreased 5.8% to $224 in the
twelve months ended December 31, 2002 from $238 in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2001. We believe that this decline in the average revenue per
total booked travel offer was primarily driven by a change in the mix of our
travel services sold. Specifically, revenues from our hotel and rental car
businesses, which, on average, have a lower transaction value, grew as a
percentage of total travel revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001.

Merchant
revenues, particularly airline tickets, continue to account for the majority of
our revenue.  Seasonal variations in our
travel business have historically and are expected to continue to impact our
travel revenues.

The
following table represents the percentage of total merchant revenue by quarter:

Agency Revenues

.  Agency revenues are derived
from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and
where the prices of our products are determined by third parties.  Agency revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of: (1) processing fees and
third-party supplier commissions related to the sale of travel products
including the sale of price


disclosed
airline tickets, cruises and other travel services; and (2) ancillary fees,
including GDS reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed
transactions.  Agency revenues for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2002 increased approximately 22% from the same
period a year ago, primarily as a result of our increased focus on the retail
airline ticket business and the resulting increase in travel commissions
earned.

Other Revenues.

Other revenues
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily
of: (1) advertising revenues; (2) fees from our home financing and automobile
services; (3) transaction revenue from our long distance phone service, which
we repositioned in 2002; and (4) in 2002, license fees from Hutchison-Priceline
Limited.

Other
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 decreased approximately
34% to $6.8 million from $10.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
2001, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues from our long distance
phone service.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of Revenues.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of airline
tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment
fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of
airline tickets; (2) the cost of hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of hotel
occupancy tax; and (3) the cost of rental cars from our suppliers, net of
applicable taxes.  Cost of merchant
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, decreased primarily due
to a decrease in sales of airline tickets.

Cost of Agency Revenues.

Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are
amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any.

Cost of Other Revenues

.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, cost of other
revenues consisted of the cost of long distance telephone service provided by
our suppliers and decreased as a result of lower fees earned from our long
distance phone service.


Gross Profit

Merchant Gross Profit.

Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost
of travel revenues. We are able to manage the level of gross margins by
controlling the price at which we will cause offers to be fulfilled.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2002, merchant gross profit and related merchant gross margin decreased from
the same period in 2001, primarily due to the weak retail environment for
airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us. In particular,
we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be
willing to make the trade­off associated with our products in exchange for
savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel products at the lower
retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs.
In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath
of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thus decreasing capacity on
existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us.

Agency Gross Profit

.  Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is
recorded net of agency costs.  For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2002, agency gross profit increased over the
same period in 2001 due to an increase in agency revenues.

Other Gross Profit.

For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2002, other gross profit decreased over the same
period in 2001 as a result of the decrease in fees earned in connection with
our long distance phone service.

Operating Expenses

Advertising


Advertising
expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and radio advertising; (2) online
and e-mail advertisements; and (3) agency fees, creative talent and production
costs for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2002, advertising expenses decreased over the same period in
2001 primarily due to the decrease in television advertising, which was
partially offset by an increase in online and radio advertising.

In the first half of 2002,
we shifted some of our marketing resources from traditional areas of marketing
such as television and radio, toward lower cost online marketing and in the
latter half of 2002, we began to focus again on television and radio
advertising.  During 2002, advertising
expenses benefited from the resolution of certain agency obligations, offset
entirely by additional advertising expenditures.

The net result of these items did not have a
material impact on either the total advertising expense or the total operating
results.

Sales and Marketing

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees;
(2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers;
and (3) provisions for credit card charge-backs.

For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2002, sales and marketing expenses decreased over the same
period in 2001 due to a reduction in the absolute amount of credit card
charge-backs and a related $1 million decrease in the allowance for
charge-backs, as well as a reduction in variable expenses driven by lower unit
volume.

Personnel

Personnel
expenses consist primarily of compensation to our personnel, including
salaries, bonuses, taxes and employee health benefits.  For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2002, personnel expenses increased over the same periods in
2001, primarily due to a decrease in shared personnel charges relating to our
European and Asian operations, which is a reduction of personnel expenses.


General and Administrative

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) business insurance; (2)
occupancy expenses; (3) telecommunications costs; and (4) fees for outside
professionals. General and administrative expenses decreased during the twelve
months ended December 31, 2002 over the same period in 2001 primarily as a
result of a decrease in professional fees and telecom expenses, offset by an
increase in premiums on our Directors and Officers liability insurance policy.

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we recorded charges of
approximately $120,000 for payroll taxes relating to options exercised in
accordance with our employee stock option plans. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2001, payroll taxes relating to the exercise of employee
stock options were $909,000.

Stock
based compensation decreased over the same period in 2001 as a result of the
completion of the amortization of restricted stock.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, we accelerated the vesting of
restricted stock held by certain employees based on the anticipated
achievements of earnings performance targets established at the time of grant
(fourth quarter of 2000). As a result of the acceleration of the vesting of the
restricted stock, we recorded a charge of approximately $3.3 million in the
fourth quarter 2001. In addition, in connection with the accelerated vesting of
restricted stock, we paid the tax withholding liability associated with the vesting
of such shares, including amounts in excess of the minimum statutory tax
withholding, by withholding from delivery to certain employees shares of stock
and, as a result, recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $3.1 million.

Information Technology

Information
technology expenses consist primarily of: 
(1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data
communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet site;
and (3) payments to outside contractors. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, information
technology expenses decreased slightly from the same as the same period in
2001.

During 2002, information
technology expenses were impacted by the favorable resolution of certain data
center,


telecom and contract programming obligations. In the absence of such
adjustments information technology expenses would have been approximately 2%
higher than the amount recorded during 2001.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation
and amortization expenses consist of: 
(1) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (2)
depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of our leasehold
improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization
of our intangible assets with determinable lives.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, depreciation
and amortization expense increased over the same periods in 2001, primarily as
a result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2002.

Restructuring, Severance, and
Special Charges

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately
$4.7 million.  This restructuring charge
resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel businesses and a reduction in
headcount.  The repositioning was
designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel
business.  The charge relates primarily
to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments.

As
a result of the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, our work force was reduced
by 59 full-time employees at our Norwalk location and 4 full-time employees at
our Europe location.  The employee
termination costs primarily represent severance payments and related
benefits.  The real estate costs
primarily represent the estimated net lease expense related to space we decided
we no longer needed, and which we will not utilize in the future along with
certain required refurbishments to that space. 
Asset impairments are comprised of abandoned equipment and software
projects, and software costs related to our plans not to pursue certain product
offerings and activities.  Other
restructuring charges include professional and other fees and costs incurred in
2002 associated with the restructuring activities.

In
the second quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors announced that Richard S.
Braddock had been reappointed as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Braddock replaced
Daniel H. Schulman, our prior President and Chief Executive Officer. In
connection with Mr. Schulman’s separation, we recorded a severance charge of
$5.4 million in the second quarter of 2001. This severance charge resulted from
the forgiveness of outstanding loans to Mr. Schulman and the payment of
severance, all of which was required by the terms of Mr. Schulman’s employment
agreement. We also accelerated, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Schulman’s
employment agreement, the vesting of 2,000,000 shares of restricted common
stock and 1,000,000 shares underlying stock options granted to Mr. Schulman,
resulting in a charge of approximately $770,000. The balance due to Mr.
Schulman ($345,000) was paid in the second quarter 2002.

In
the first quarter of 2001, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately
$1.4 million. This restructuring charge related primarily to the reduction of
our workforce by approximately 25 full-time employees in February 2001.
The charge relates primarily to severance payments and the entire amount of the
charge was disbursed in 2001.


During
2002 and 2001, we decreased the liability for the restructuring charge and
special charge by approximately $2.3 million and approximately $2.8 million,
respectively.  These reductions resulted
from the favorable resolution of certain matters, primarily the collection of
certain receivables, the settlement of real estate commitments and the
settlement of certain liabilities, and were reflected as an adjustment to the
“Restructuring charge (reversal)” and “Special charge (reversal)” line items on
our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Impairment Charge

During the third quarter of 2002, we performed impairment tests and
determined that the carrying amount of goodwill of $22.5 million related to our
European licensee exceeded its implied fair value by approximately $12 million
and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of $12 million. The fair value
was determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including the
market value of comparable companies (including revenue multiple methodology)
and discounted cash flow. Underlying the impairment was a continued decline in
the market value of priceline.com’s common stock, which we review quarterly as
an indicator of possible impairment of priceline.com europe Ltd.’s carrying
value, a deterioration in priceline.com europe Ltd.’s operations caused
primarily by increasingly competitive conditions among European online travel
companies and a decision in the third quarter of 2002 to reconfigure product
offerings.

During the third quarter of 2002 we performed a periodic evaluation of
the progress of the operations of Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Factors
including increasing negative variances in key operating metrics such as
negative gross margins and continuing operating losses, negative net asset
position and an increasingly competitive operating environment led us to
determine that the carrying value of our convertible note no longer reflected
its fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$12.2 million.  Estimated fair value was
determined using cash flow estimates and a review of the market value of
comparable companies including the consideration of the decline in our market
value and through discussion with third party valuation specialists.

Interest

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, interest income on cash and
marketable securities decreased primarily due to a lower cash balance and lower
interest rates.


Equity in Income of Investees, net

Equity
in net income of Investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31,
2002 and 2001 of $1.1 million and $551,000, respectively, represents our pro
rata share of net income from our 49% equity investment in
pricelinemortgage.  We recorded an
impairment charge of approximately $1 million during the fourth quarter of 2002
(which is included in the “Equity in income of investees, net line of our
Statement of Operations) to reflect the write-down of our investment in
pricelinemortgage to its estimated fair value.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As
of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $268.0 million in cash, cash
equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. Approximately $22.5
million is restricted cash collateralizing certain letters of credit issued in
favor of certain suppliers and landlords. Also included in restricted cash are
amounts held by our credit card processor company and interest rate swap
counter-party. We generally invest excess cash to make such funds readily
available for operating purposes.  Cash
equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of highly
liquid, high quality, investment grade debt instruments, having maturities of
less than two years.

Because
we collect cash up front from our customers and then pay our suppliers over a
ten to fifteen day period, we tend to experience significant swings in supplier
payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last
few weeks of every quarter.  This can
cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or
less than our operating income would indicate.

Net
cash provided by operating activities during 2003 was approximately $20.0
million, resulting from our net income of approximately $11.9 million, non-cash
expenses of approximately $18.6 million, and changes in working capital that
reduced operating cash flow by approximately $10.5 million.  Non-cash items were primarily associated
with the depreciation of property and equipment, and the Marriott warrant
charge.  The changes in working capital
were primarily related to an approximately $13.8 million decrease in accounts
payable and accrued expenses.  The
decrease in accounts payable was related to our year-end supplier payables only
being outstanding for 10 calendar days, as compared to 15 calendar days in
2002.  The decrease was also
attributable to cash payments related to our restructuring during the year, and
a general decrease in expenses which resulted in lower trade accounts payable
and accrued expense balances.  Net cash
provided by operating activities during 2002 was approximately $814,000,
resulting from our net loss of approximately $19.2 million, offset by non-cash
items of approximately $42.5 million and changes in working capital of
approximately $22.5 million.  Non-cash
items were primarily associated with the impairment charge from our investments
and the depreciation of property and equipment.

Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately $112.7 million and
approximately $24.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively.  During 2003,
Lowestfare.com, our wholly-owned subsidiary, made equity investments totaling
approximately $14.2 million.  In both
years, net cash used in investing activities was partially related to purchases
of property and equipment. Also affecting net cash used in investing activities
in 2003 and 2002 was the investment


in short-term investments and marketable securities in the amount of
approximately $87.3 million and approximately $14.9 million, respectively.  Capital expenditures in 2003 were
approximately $6.6 million.  Capital
expenditures for additions to property and equipment, is expected to aggregate
approximately $6 to $10 million in 2004.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately $118.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.  This
was primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of our Convertible
Senior Notes, discussed in more detail below, and the proceeds from the
exercise of employee stock options.  This
amount was partially offset by the repurchase of our common stock.  On July 31, 2002, our board of
directors authorized the repurchase of up to $40 million of common stock from
time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  As part of the stock repurchase program, we
purchased 690,000 and 897,953 shares, of our common stock for our treasury
during the periods ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, at
an aggregate cost of $12.2 million and $11.8 million, respectively.  We may purchase additional shares of our
common stock in the future.  Net cash
used in financing activities was approximately $8.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002.  This was
primarily the result of our repurchase of our common stock discussed above,
partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.

The
following table represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and
commitments as of December 31, 2003:

Priceline.com
leases certain property, primarily buildings in Norwalk, Connecticut, Columbus,
Ohio and New York City.  We also lease a
small amount of office space in Staines, England.  These leases are accounted for as operating leases.  The operating lease obligations represent
the minimum payments for our operating leases. See Note 17 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In
August 2003, we issued, in a private placement, $125 million aggregate
principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an
interest rate of 1%.  We intend to use
the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, strategic
purposes and working capital requirements. 
The notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into our
common stock, par value $0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a
conversion price of approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events. 
Each $1,000 principal amount of notes will initially be convertible into
25 shares of our common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the
closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30
consecutive trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period, as
defined in the offering memorandum related to the notes, is more than 110% of
the then current conversion price of the notes, or after August 1, 2008,
the closing price of our common stock is more than 110% of the then current
conversion price of the notes.  The
notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances set forth in the
offering memorandum, such as a change in control of priceline.com.  In addition, the notes will be redeemable at
our option beginning in 2008, and the holders may require us to repurchase the
notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other circumstances.  Interest on the notes is payable on
February 1 and August 1 of each year.


Excluded
from the table above are letters of credit that were issued in favor of certain
suppliers and landlords. The letters of credit expire between February of
2003 and April of 2004 and are generally subject to automatic renewal upon
expiration of the letter of credit. 
Also excluded are employment agreements with certain members of senior
management that provide for minimum annual compensation, upon termination of
employment, of approximately $4 million.

Our
Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus
an amount equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid, and is
subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007.  In the event that we consummate certain
business combination transactions, our Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed
at the option of the Company or the holder of our Series B Preferred Stock at
the liquidation preference per outstanding share, plus all dividends accrued
but not paid on the shares and all dividends that would have accrued through
February 6, 2007.  There were
13,470 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31,
2003.  See Note 13 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information regarding the rights and preferences
of our Series B Preferred Stock.

We
believe that we will benefit in future years due to the significant amount of
net operating loss carryforwards that we can utilize to offset future taxable
income.

We
believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient
to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations
through at least the next twelve months. However, for periods thereafter, if we
are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in
raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms
acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures
and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a
material adverse effect on our projected financial condition or results of
operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity
securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be
diluted.  There are no assurances that
we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that
revenue growth will be realized or that future borrowings or equity
contributions will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated
capital expenditures or finance our business plan.

Item 7A

.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure About Market Risk

We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through
internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate,
through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative
financial instruments, including an interest rate hedge to manage market risks.
Additional information regarding our interest rate hedge is contained within
“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivative
Financial Instruments” above.

The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income
statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future
adverse fluctuations in interest rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk
by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest
rates on a daily basis. This evaluation includes the review of leading market
indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers
regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market
projections as to expected future interest rates. We utilize this information
to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use
of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential
future interest rate exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow


speculation
in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument
contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial
instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged
derivatives.

We determine the impact of changes in interest rates on the
fair value of our financial instruments based on a hypothetical 10% adverse
change in interest rates from the rates in effect as of the end of the year for
these financial instruments.  The only potential limitations of the
respective models are in the assumptions utilized in the models such as the
hypothetical adverse fluctuation rate and the discount rate. We believe that
these models and the assumptions utilized are reasonable and sufficient to
yield proper market risk disclosure.

We did not experience any material changes in interest rate
exposures during the year ended December 31, 2003.  Based upon
economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2003, we
do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near
future.

As of December 31, 2003, after adjusting for the effect
of the interest rate swap agreement, we have fixed rate debt of approximately
$125 million.  The fair value of our debt was $103,275,000 at
December 31, 2003.  The potential fair value change resulting from a
hypothetical 10% adverse fluctuation in interest rates related to priceline’s
outstanding fixed-rate debt would be approximately $626,000 as of
December 31, 2003.

As
of December 31, 2003, we held an interest rate swap agreement on $45
million notional value of our fixed rate debt.  The fair value (cost if
terminated) of this swap as of December 31, 2003 was approximately
$537,000.  A 10% adverse fluctuation in
the 3-month LIBOR rate as of the end of the year would not decrease the
interest rate swap’s fair value by a significant amount.  Any increase or decrease in the fair value
of the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be
substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value
of the hedged underlying asset, liability, or cash flow.

Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the cost of international
airline tickets and international hotel reservations offered through the
priceline.com service, and so may indirectly affect consumer demand for such
products and priceline.com’s revenue.   
In the event of such weakness, such additional US Dollars would have
reduced purchasing power. If the US Dollar weakens versus the British Pound
Sterling, we may have to invest additional US Dollars in priceline.com europe
Ltd. to fund its ongoing operations.

Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate
volatility.  To the extent that changes
in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic
conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such changes.

INDEX TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

priceline.com Incorporated:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of priceline.com
Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Those
standards required that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

Priceline.com
Incorporated (“priceline.com,” or the “Company”) is a leading online travel
company that offers its customers a broad range of travel products, including
airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages and cruises.  The Company’s unique

Name Your Own Price

®

system –
which allows its customers to make offers for travel products at prices they
set – enables its customers to use the Internet to save money on travel
products and services while enabling sellers, which include many of the major
domestic airline, hotel and rental car companies, to generate incremental
revenue.  In 2003, the Company
complemented its

®

product offering by giving its customers the ability to purchase certain travel
products in a more traditional, price-disclosed manner.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

- The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary,
priceline.com Europe Holdings N. V. in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. 
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which the Company does not have
control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted
for by the equity method.

In
2003, the Company enhanced its financial reporting format.  In the past, it reported revenue segmented
between travel and other revenue, a format that was driven by its pursuit of
businesses outside of the travel industry. 
With the repositioning of its long distance and new car products in
2002, its ongoing plan to keep its strategic focus on the online travel sector
and its recent commitment to compliment its core

Name Your Own Price

®

products by developing
agency-based retail travel products, the decision was made to provide revenue
and gross profit reporting in three categories:  Merchant (encompassing substantially all

Name Your Own Price

®

travel
services), Agency (encompassing substantially all priced-disclosed retail
services) and Other (encompassing all remaining revenue, the largest component
of which is advertising revenue).  In 2003,
the Company further enhanced its financial reporting format by adding two
additional operating expense line items, Personnel and Information
Technology.  The Company believes that
the addition of these line items, as well as the discontinuance of the Systems
and Business Development category, is more useful to readers of its financial
statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years financial
statements to conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications had
no impact on previously reported net income or stockholders’ equity.

In
2003, the Company’s stockholders approved a one-for-six reverse stock split of
its outstanding common stock.  The
reverse stock split was effected at 12:01 a.m. on June 16, 2003, and, as a
result, the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from
approximately 227.6 million to approximately 37.9 million shares.  The par value of the common stock was not
affected by the reverse stock split and remains at $0.008 per share.  Consequently, on the Company’s balance
sheet, the aggregate par value of the issued common stock was reduced by
reclassifying the par value amount of the eliminated shares of common stock to
Additional Paid-in Capital.  All per
share amounts and outstanding shares, including all common stock equivalents
(stock options), have been retroactively restated in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement for all
periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split.

Use of Estimates

- The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the


financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

- The
Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash, accounts receivable-net, accounts payable and accrued
expenses, are carried at cost which approximates their fair value because of
the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  As of December 31, 2003, the fair value
of the Convertible Senior Notes was $103,275,000.  The Company uses derivative financial instruments, including
interest rate hedges to manage market risks. 
The Company entered into an interest rate hedge agreement in relation to
$45 million of the outstanding borrowings of the Convertible Secured Notes with
a term of approximately 5 years 2003. 
See Note 10, “Convertible Debt.”

Cash and Cash Equivalents

- The Company invests excess
cash primarily in money market accounts, certificates of deposits, and
short-term commercial paper. All highly liquid instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

Short-Term Investments

– At December 31, 2003
and 2002, the Company had short-term investments of $151.7 million and $64.2
million, respectively.  The short-term
investments primarily consist of commercial paper, corporate notes, and U.S.
Government Agency Securities.  In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” the Company has classified
these short-term investments as available-for-sale.  These securities are carried at estimated fair market value.  The aggregate unrealized gains and losses
related to these investments, net of taxes, are reflected as a part of other
comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.

The
specific-identification method is used to determine the carrying value of all
securities. The marketable securities are presented as current assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as they are available to meet the
short-term working capital needs of the Company.

The fair
value of the investments is based on the quoted market price of the securities
at the balance sheet dates. Investments are considered to be impaired when a
decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. Once a decline in
fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is
recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.

Restricted Cash

- Restricted cash
collateralizes letters of credit issued in favor of certain suppliers and
landlords. The letters of credit expire between April of 2004 through
March of 2005 and are generally subject to automatic renewal upon
expiration. Also included in restricted cash are amounts held by our credit
card processing company, and the interest rate swap counterparty.

Property and Equipment

- Property and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis,
over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, when applicable, the life of
the lease, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill –

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations”, and SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS No. 141 requires that all business
combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain
acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets
apart from goodwill.  SFAS No. 142
requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests
of the goodwill’s impairment and that identifiable intangible assets other than
goodwill be amortized over their useful lives. 
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 in 2002 and performed the initial and
final steps of the transitional impairment test as required.  There was no impairment resulting from the
transitional impairment test. 
Subsequent impairment losses were reflected in operating loss in
2002.  Impairment testing performed
during 2003 resulted in no impairment. 
See Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements for analysis of the
Company’s impairment tests.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

- The Company
reviews long-lived assets and intangibles for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition


exceeds its carrying amount. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is
measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the present
value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with
the risks involved.

Software Capitalization

- Certain direct development
costs associated with internal-use software are capitalized and include
external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees
devoting time to the software projects. These costs are included in software
and are amortized over a period not to exceed three years beginning when the
asset is substantially ready for use. Costs incurred during the preliminary
project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as
incurred.

Revenues and Cost of Revenues

– Merchant
revenues and related cost of revenues are derived from transactions where the
Company is the merchant of record and determines the price to be paid by the
customer. The Company recognizes such revenue and costs if and when it accepts
and fulfills the customer’s offer. Merchant revenues and cost of revenues
include the selling price and cost, respectively, of the travel product and are
reported on a gross basis. Occasionally, the Company provides refunds and makes
certain customer accommodations to satisfy disputes and complaints. The Company
accrues for such estimated losses and classifies the resulting expense as
adjustments to revenue and cost of revenues or the allowance for doubtful
accounts as appropriate.

Agency
revenues are derived from travel related transactions where the Company is not
the merchant of record and where the prices of its products are determined by
third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing
fees and Worldspan reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts
received, without any associated cost of revenue. Such revenues are recognized
by the Company when the travel transaction is completed.

Advertising

- Advertising expenses are
comprised primarily of costs of off-line (television, radio and newspaper) and
online (online and e-mail) advertising, agency fees, creative talent and
production cost for television and radio commercials.  The Company expenses the production costs of advertising the
first time the advertising takes place.

Sales and Marketing

- Sales and marketing
expenses are comprised primarily of credit card processing fees, fees paid to
third-party service providers that operate our call centers and provisions for
credit card charge-backs.  Sales and
marketing costs are expensed as incurred.

Information Technology

– Information technology
expenses are comprised primarily of system maintenance and software license
fees, data communications and other expenses associated with operating our
Internet site and payments to outside contractors. Such costs are expensed as
incurred.

Equity-Based Compensation

- The Company accounts for
stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure.”  As allowed by SFAS 123, the Company accounts
for stock options issued to employees under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.  Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation
expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant, between the
fair value of priceline.com’s stock and the exercise price of the option.

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
Services.” All transactions, in which goods or services are the consideration
received for the issuance of equity instruments, are accounted for based on the
fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity
instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The


measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is
the earlier of the date on which the counterparty’s performance is complete or
the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.

The
following table summarizes relevant information as to reported results under
the Company’s APB Opinion No. 25 method of accounting for stock options with
supplemental information as if the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123 had been applied (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The
fair value of stock options granted was determined on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and the
following weighted average assumptions:

Income Taxes

- The Company accounts for
income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary difference between
the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently
enacted tax rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

Earnings Per Share

- The Company computes basic
and diluted earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per
Share.”  SFAS No. 128 requires the Company
to report both basic


earnings per share, which is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share, which is based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding.

For
purposes of calculating basic and dilutive earnings per share, we used the
following weighted average shares outstanding (in thousands):

(1)

Since the
Company incurred losses for 2002 and 2001, the inclusion of stock options and
warrants in the calculation of weighted average common shares was
anti-dilutive; and therefore there was no difference between basic and diluted
earnings per share.

Segment Reporting

- The Company operates and
manages its business as a single segment.

Foreign Currency Translation

- For priceline.com europe
Ltd., the local foreign currency is the functional currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange existing
at year end.  Income statement amounts
are translated at the average monthly exchange rates.  Translation gains and losses are included as a component of
stockholders’ equity.  Transaction gains
and losses are included in the statement of operations and were immaterial for
all periods presented.

Derivative Financial Instruments

- - The Company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest
rates. The Company uses derivatives principally in the management of interest
rate exposure. It does not utilize derivatives that contain leverage features.
On the date on which the Company enters into a derivative transaction, the
derivative is designated as a hedge of the identified exposure. The Company
formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged
items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking
the hedge transaction. In this documentation, the Company specifically
identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or
net investment that has been designated as the hedged item and states how the
hedging instrument is expected to reduce the risks related to the hedged item.
The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In
July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”).  This statement addresses significant issues regarding the
recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with exit
and disposal activities, including restructuring activities.  SFAS 146 is effective for exit and disposal
activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002.  The Company adopted the new standard on
January 1, 2003.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (Revised) (“FIN 46-R”) to address certain FIN 46 implementation issues. As the Company has no variable interest entities, the adoption of these pronouncements had no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment
of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS 149
amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging


activities
under SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”
SFAS 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30,
2003.  The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial
instruments and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.  As
of December 31, 2003, the Company’s only derivative financial instrument
is an interest rate hedge agreement in relation to $45 million of the outstanding
borrowings of the Convertible Secured Notes. 
The adoption of SFAS No. 149 on July 1, 2003, as required, had no
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (“SFAS 150”).  SFAS
150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.  SFAS 150 is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003.  The Company adopted
the new standard on July 31, 2003, with no effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

Effective
July 1, 2003, the company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue
No. 00-21, Accounting For Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,
which establishes criteria for whether revenue on a deliverable can be
recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable
arrangement.  The criteria considers
whether the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, whether the
fair value of the delivered item can be reliably determined and the customer’s
right of return for the delivered item. 
While the Company does enter into multiple deliverable arrangements, all
elements are delivered at the same time and therefore the adoption of this standard
had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

RESTRUCTURING, SPECIAL AND SEVERANCE CHARGES

In
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $564,000.  This
restructuring charge resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of the
Company’s estimated real estate costs related to leased property vacated in
connection with the 2002 and 2000 restructurings.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $4.7 million.  This
restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of the Company’s
non-travel businesses and a reduction in headcount.  The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and
focus resources on our travel business. 
The charge related primarily to severance payments, real estate costs
and asset impairments.

The
Company’s work force was reduced by 59 full-time employees at its Norwalk
location and 4 full-time employees at its Europe location.  The employee termination costs primarily
represent severance payments and related benefits.  The real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease
expense related to space the Company decided it no longer needed, and which it
will not utilize in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that
space.  Asset impairments are comprised
of abandoned equipment and software projects, and software costs related to the
Company’s plans not to pursue certain product offerings and activities.  Other restructuring charges include
professional and other fees and costs incurred in 2002 associated with the
restructuring activities.

In
the second quarter of 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors announced that
Richard S. Braddock had been reappointed as Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Braddock replaced Daniel H. Schulman,
its prior President and Chief Executive Officer. In connection with Mr.
Schulman’s separation, the Company recorded a severance charge of $5.4 million
in the second quarter of 2001. This severance charge resulted from the
forgiveness of outstanding loans to Mr. Schulman and the payment of severance,
all of which was required by the terms of Mr. Schulman’s employment agreement.
The Company also accelerated, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Schulman’s
employment agreement, the vesting of 2,000,000 shares of restricted common
stock and 1,000,000 shares underlying stock options granted to


Mr. Schulman, resulting in a charge of approximately $770,000. The
balance due to Mr. Schulman ($345,000) was paid in second quarter 2002.

In
the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $1.4 million. This restructuring charge related primarily to the
reduction of the Company’s workforce by approximately 25 full-time employees in
February 2001. The charge relates primarily to severance payments and the
entire amount of the charge was disbursed in 2001.

In
2000, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $32.0
million.  The restructuring charge
resulted from the Company’s review of its operations with the intention of
increasing efficiencies and refocusing its business principally on its core
travel products.  As a result of this
review, the Company primarily decided to reduce its work force, consolidate its
real estate and rationalize certain international markets and potential product
line offerings.

The
components and the annual activity related to the restructuring charges for the
three-year period ended December 31, 2003 were as follows (in thousands):


During
2003 and 2002, the Company decreased the liability for the restructuring charge
by approximately $753,000 and approximately $916,000, respectively.  These reductions resulted from the favorable
resolution of certain matters, primarily the collection of certain receivables
and the settlement of real estate commitments, and were reflected as an
adjustment to the “Restructuring charge (reversal)” line on the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The
Company estimates, based on current available information, the remaining net
cash outflows associated with our restructuring related commitments will be as
follows (in thousands):

Restructuring related liabilities due within 12 months and due after 12
months are classified in “Accrued expenses” and in “Other long-term
liabilities”, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVES

The Company provides for costs associated with purchases made using
fraudulent credit cards.  Because the
Company acts as merchant of record in the majority of its transactions, it may
be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on the priceline.com
website as well as other payment disputes with its customers.  Additionally, the Company is liable for
accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when it does
not act as merchant of record. 
Accordingly, the Company calculates and


records an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs.
Beginning in the second half of 2001, the Company launched a company-wide
credit card charge-back reduction project aimed at preventing the acceptance of
fraudulent credit cards.  This project
has been expanded to encompass retail transactions.

A summary of the activity in the allowance for credit card chargebacks
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows (in
thousands):

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The
Company’s intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):


Intangible
assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis.  Intangible assets amortization expense was
approximately $453,000, $402,600 and $278,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In 2003,
pursuant to asset purchase agreements, the Company purchased the Internet
domain names www.rentalcars.com and www.breezenet.com, and their related
intellectual property.  The acquisitions
were part of the Company’s plan to grow its rental car business.  The acquisitions were accounted for as
purchases and, accordingly, the total purchase price of approximately $5.5
million was allocated to the assets acquired, primarily indefinite lived
intangibles and other intangibles with determinable lives, based on their
respective fair values on the acquisition date.  The results of operations of rentalcars.com and breezenet.com are
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the respective
acquisition dates.  The pro forma effect
of the acquisitions on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, assuming the
acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2002, is not material.

The
annual estimated amortization expense for the amortizable acquired intangible
assets for the next five years is as follows (in thousands):

GOODWILL

In 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 62% of
the issued and outstanding shares of priceline.com Europe Holdings, N.V., the
parent company of priceline.com europe Ltd. (together with priceline.com Europe
Holdings, N.V., “priceline.com europe”). The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase and the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of
the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill at the end of 2001.  Since the acquisition, the Company has
recognized the entire consolidated net loss of priceline.com Europe Holdings,
N.V. since the minority stockholders had no commitment to fund the losses.

On January 31, 2002, the Company invested an additional $10
million in priceline.com Europe Holdings, N.V., which increased the Company’s
equity interest to approximately 75% of the issued and outstanding shares.  In the fourth quarter 2003, the Company
purchased the remaining interest in priceline.com Europe Holdings, N.V. that it
did not already own.

During
the third quarter of 2002, the Company performed impairment tests and
determined that the carrying amount of goodwill associated with its investment
in priceline.com europe exceeded its implied fair value by approximately $12
million and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of $12 million. The fair
value was determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including
the market value of comparable companies (including revenue multiple
methodology) and discounted cash flow methods. 
Underlying the impairment was a continued decline in the market value of
priceline.com’s common stock, which the Company reviews quarterly as an
indicator of possible impairment of


priceline.com europe’s carrying value, a deterioration in priceline.com
europe’s operations caused primarily by increasingly competitive conditions
among European online travel companies, and a decision in 2002 to reconfigure
product offerings.

During
2003, goodwill was reduced by approximately $2.1 million as a result of changes
in estimates related to certain pre-acquisition obligations related to exit
costs recorded as part of the acquisition in accordance with EITF 95-3
“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business
Combination.”  Goodwill at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 consists of the following (in thousands):

9.

OTHER ASSETS

Other assets at
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 consist of the following (in
thousands):

Investment in
pricelinemortgage represents the Company’s 49% equity investment in pricelinemortgage
and, accordingly, the Company has recognized its pro rata share of
pricelinemortgage’s operating results, not to exceed an amount that the Company
believes represents the investments’ estimated fair value.  The Company recognized approximately $3.1
million, approximately $1.1 million and approximately $551,000, respectively,
of income from its investment in pricelinemortgage in 2003, 2002 and 2001.  The Company earned advertising fees from
pricelinemortgage of approximately $534,000, approximately $1.7 million and
approximately $1.7 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In March 2003, Lowestfare.com, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, invested approximately $8.7 million (including fees relating to
the transaction) in Travelweb LLC.  Lowestfare.com’s
investment represents approximately 14% of the outstanding equity of Travelweb
LLC.  The investment is accounted for
under the equity method of accounting.

Lowestfare.com
has a seat on Travelweb LLC’s Board of Directors.  The Company recognized approximately $734,000 of net loss from
its investment in Travelweb LLC in 2003. 
The Company earned travel commissions from Travelweb LLC of
approximately $164,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The excess of the carrying
value of the Company’s equity investments in Travelweb LLC and
pricelinemortgage over its equity in the underlying net assets of the investees
was approximately $7.8 million as of December 31, 2003.


Deferred debt issuance costs
arose from the Company’s issuance of $125 million aggregate principal amount of
1% Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010.  Deferred debt issuance costs of approximately $4.3 million,
consisting primarily of underwriting commissions and professional service fees,
are being amortized using the effective interest rate method over five years.

During the
third quarter of 2002 the Company performed a periodic evaluation of the
progress of the operations of Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Factors including
increasing negative variances in key operating metrics such as negative gross
margins and continuing operating losses, negative net asset position and an
increasingly competitive operating environment led the Company to determine
that the carrying value of its convertible note no longer reflected its fair
value. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$12.2 million.  Estimated fair value was
determined using cash flow estimates and a review of the market value of
comparable companies including the consideration of the decline in the
Company’s market value and through discussion with third party valuation
specialists.  See Note 19 to these
Consolidated Financial Statements.

10.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

In August 2003, the Company issued, in private placement, $125
million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due
August 1, 2010, with an interest rate of 1%.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for
general corporate purposes, strategic purposes and working capital
requirements.  The notes are
convertible, subject to certain conditions, into priceline.com’s common stock,
par value $0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price
of approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events.  Each $1,000 principal
amount of notes will initially be convertible into 25 shares of the Company’s
common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, if the closing price of
the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period is more than 110%
of the then current conversion price of the notes, or after August 1,
2008, the closing price of the Company’s common stock is more than 110% of the
then current conversion price of the notes. 
The notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances set forth
in the offering memorandum, such as a change in control of the Company.  In addition, the notes will be redeemable at
the Company’s option beginning in 2008, and the holders may require the Company
to repurchase the notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other
circumstances.  Interest on the notes is
payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year.

In November 2003, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement whereby it swapped the fixed 1% interest on its
Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010 for a floating interest rate
based on the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable margin of approximately
221 basis points, on $45 million notional value of debt.  This agreement expires August 1,
2010.  The Company designated this
interest rate swap agreement as a fair value hedge.  The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement
and the underlying debt are recorded as offsetting gains and losses in interest
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  Hedge ineffectiveness of approximately $61,000 was recorded in
interest expense in 2003.  The fair
value (cost if terminated) of this swap as of December 31, 2003 was
approximately $537,000 and has been recorded in other long-term liabilities and
as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt.


11.

TREASURY
STOCK

On July 31, 2002, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $40 million of
the Company’s common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions.  As part of the
stock repurchase program, the Company purchased 897,953 shares of its common
stock for its treasury during the period ended December 31, 2002 at an
aggregate cost of approximately $11.8 million and purchased an additional
690,000 shares of its common stock for its treasury during the year ended
December 31, 2003 at an aggregate cost of approximately $12.2
million.  All shares were purchased at
prevailing market prices.

The Company
may continue or, from time to time, commence or suspend repurchases of shares
under its stock repurchase program, depending on prevailing market conditions,
alternate uses of capital and other factors. 
Whether and when to initiate and/or complete any purchase of common
stock and the amount of common stock purchased will be determined in the Company’s
complete discretion.  As of December 31,
2003, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock
held in treasury.

12.

STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY

During
2001, the Company issued 28,333 shares of restricted common stock to employees.
The accrual for deferred compensation expense related to the shares issued was
recorded at the market value on the date of grant and the related compensation
expense was amortized over the vesting period.

During
2001, the Company’s Board of Directors accelerated the vesting of all outstanding
unvested shares of the restricted common stock based on the anticipated
achievement of earnings performance targets established at the time of grant,
resulting in a compensation charge of approximately $3.3 million.  Additionally, the Company repurchased shares
in excess of certain employees’ minimum statutory tax withholding and recorded
a charge of approximately $3.1 million. Shares repurchased by the Company have
been retired.

During
the first quarter 2001, the Company sold approximately 4 million shares of its
common stock to subsidiaries of Hutchison Whampoa Limited and Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Limited in a private placement. The net proceeds were approximately
$49.5 million. Hutchison Whampoa Limited also received a seat on the Company’s
Board of Directors. Subsequently, Hutchison Whampoa Limited acquired altogether
two seats on the Company’s Board of Directors. At the same time, Hutchison
purchased $9.5 million worth of Hutchison-Priceline Limited convertible notes.
In June 2000, the Company entered into definitive agreements with
subsidiaries of Hutchison Whampoa Limited to introduce the Company’s services
to several Asian markets. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company
licenses its business model and provides expertise in technology and operations.

In
June 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved a one-for-six reverse stock
split of its outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split was effected at
12:01 a.m. on June 16, 2003, and, as a result, the Company’s issued and
outstanding common stock was reduced from approximately 227.6 million to
approximately 37.9 million shares. The par value of the common stock was not
affected by the reverse stock split and remains at $0.008 per share.

In
2003, the Company issued an aggregate of 83,333 shares of restricted common
stock to its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer.

The accrual for deferred compensation expense related
to the shares issued was recorded at the market value on the date of the grant
and the related compensation expense is being amortized over the vesting
period.  During 2003, the Company
recorded stock based compensation expense amortization of approximately
$282,000.


13.

REDEEMABLE
PREFERRED STOCK

In
February 2001, the Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the
Company’s certificate of incorporation to allow the Company to issue a new
series of preferred stock designated as Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock
(“Series B Preferred Stock”). The total number of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock that the Company is authorized to issue is 80,000 shares, par value $.01
per share.

The
Series B Preferred Stock has special preferences. Specifically, the Series B
Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus an amount
equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid and is subject to
mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007. 
The Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends payable in shares of the
Company’s common stock at a rate of 11% per annum commencing February 6,
2001. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are payable semiannually on
February 6 and August 6 of each year starting August 6, 2001.

The
Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company or the
holder, in whole or in part, at any time upon a change of control of the
Company at $1,000 per share in cash, plus accrued but unpaid dividends and
dividends that would have accrued through February 6, 2007. The Series B
Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007.
Other than as described below, the Series B Preferred Stock is not convertible
into shares of the Company’s common stock or any other security of the Company.
Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote on any matter,
except in certain limited circumstances and as specifically required under
Delaware General Corporate Law.  Holders
of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to specified cash payments in the
event of certain business combination transactions involving the Company.

During
the first quarter of 2001, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) received 80,000
shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and warrants (the “Warrants”) to
purchase approximately 4.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an
exercise price of $17.81 per share.  The
exercise price of the Warrants is paid by surrendering .0178125 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock for each share of the Company’s common stock
purchased.

Pursuant
to the terms of the certificate of designations relating to the Series B
Preferred Stock, the dividend that is payable through the issuance of shares of
the Company’s common stock each year is subject to adjustment as provided for
in the certificate of designations (and as described below as the result of
exercise of the Warrants).  In the event
the Company consummates any of certain business combination transactions, the
Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company or Delta at
the $1,000 liquidation preference per outstanding share plus all dividends
accrued but not paid on the shares.  In
such an event, Delta would be entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of
the dividend payments that would have accrued or cumulated on the shares to be
redeemed through the remaining scheduled dividend payment dates.

During
2001, Delta exercised Warrants to purchase approximately 3.1 million shares of
the Company’s common stock and on January 29, 2002, Delta exercised
Warrants to purchase 666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result,
there are 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding with an
aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $13.5 million and the
Company’s future semi-annual dividend requirement is 40,240 shares of common
stock.  In accordance with the terms of
the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company delivered to Delta 40,240, 40,240,
40,240 and 75,718 shares of the Company’s common stock as dividend payments on
August 6, 2003, February 6, 2003, August 6, 2002 and February 6,
2002, respectively.  As a result, the
Company recorded a non-cash dividend of approximately $1.19 million, $297,000,
$490,000 and $1.85 million in the third quarter of 2003, first quarter of 2003,
third quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2002, respectively.

The
Warrants provide that at any time the closing sales price of the Company’s
common stock has exceeded $53.4375 (subject to adjustment) for 20 consecutive
trading days, the Warrants will automatically be exercised.  As of December 31, 2003, there were
756,199 Warrants outstanding.


14.

OTHER WARRANTS
TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

During
July 1999, priceline.com issued to Continental Airlines a warrant to
purchase common stock that will become exercisable upon the earlier of
July 2004 or upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds.
However, the agreement does not require Continental to make any performance
commitments.

In
November 1999, the Company amended the Continental warrant to allow the exercise
price to fall within the range of the warrants issued to other airlines
discussed below. The amended warrant granted Continental the right to purchase
a total of 166,666 shares of priceline.com common stock at an exercise price of
$359.58.

In
November 1999, the Company entered into separate Participation Warrant
Agreements with each of eight major domestic airlines relating to their
inclusion in the Company’s leisure airline ticket service. Under the
Participation Warrant Agreements, the airlines were granted warrants to
purchase a total of approximately 3.3 million shares of priceline.com common
stock at exercise prices ranging from $339.75 to $359.58 per share. All
warrants were fully vested on the date of grant, but generally are not
exercisable until November 2005, subject to acceleration under certain
circumstances.

In March 2003, in connection with the renewal of a marketing
agreement with Marriott International, Inc., (“Marriott”) the Company issued
Marriott 833,333 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at
an exercise price of $9.84 per share. 
The warrants, which are not transferable, are fully vested,
non-forfeitable, and will be exercisable no earlier than three years from the
date of issuance (subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a
reorganization, recapitalization, merger or consolidation involving
priceline.com).  In connection with the
issuance of the warrants, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $6.6
million in 2003 determined by using an option pricing model.

STOCK OPTION
PLANS

Priceline.com
Incorporated has adopted the 1997 Omnibus Plan (the “1997 Plan”), the 1999
Omnibus Plan (the “1999 Plan”) and the 2000 Employee Stock Option Plan (the
“2000 Plan”), each of which provides for grants of options as incentives and
rewards to encourage employees, officers, consultants and directors in the
long-term success of the Company. The 1997 Plan, 1999 Plan and 2000 Plan
provide for grants of options to purchase up to 3,979,166, 5,895,833 and 1,000,000
shares of priceline.com common stock, respectively, at a purchase price equal
to the fair market value on the date of grant.

Diluted
shares and diluted earnings per share normally include the effect of
“in-the-money” stock options and warrants calculated based on the average share
price of our stock during the measurement period.  As the Company’s stock price increases, there is a greater number
of stock options and warrants that have intrinsic value and that have the
effect of increasing the number of diluted shares.  The table below shows the unaudited number of diluted shares that
would be used to calculate diluted earnings per share based upon different
hypothetical stock prices.


(1)  Diluted shares are
determined under the same calculation required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128 (SFAS 128) which requires that we report both
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS). 
Basic EPS reports earnings as if no stock options or warrants are
outstanding.  Diluted EPS reports
earnings assuming all outstanding in-the-money options and warrants are
exercised and that all exercise proceeds and tax benefits are used to
repurchase shares at the market price of our stock.  This calculation of Diluted shares is typically referred to as
the “treasury stock method”.

(2)  Values represent the number
of warrants that are included in the calculation of diluted shares pursuant to
the treasury stock method.

(3)

Values represent
number of common shares to be issued assuming conversion of convertible notes
at $40.00 conversion price.

(4)  Values represent the net
number of employee options that are included in the calculation of diluted
shares pursuant to the treasury stock method.

(5)  Equals employee options (as
described in footnote 3 above) divided by Diluted Shares (as described in
footnote 1 above).

(6)  Equals cash proceeds to be
received by priceline.com upon employee exercise of stock options (i.e. strike
price value of  stock options) and
conversion of convertible notes.

(7)  Shows the decrease, if any,
in diluted EPS as a result of an increase in diluted shares caused by an
increase in our stock price.

TAXES

Income Taxes - The Company,
since converting from a limited liability company to a corporation in July,
1998, has incurred cumulative net operating losses for financial accounting
purposes and accordingly, no provision for income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying statements of operations.

The tax effects of temporary
differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows (in thousands):

A
valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset was recorded
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and represents the portion of tax operating
loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that
the benefit of such items will not be realized.  Such valuation allowance decreased by approximately $3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003 and increased by approximately $5
million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

At
December 31, 2003 the Company had approximately $3 billion of net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes expiring from
December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2023 which are subject to
limitation on future utilization under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986.  Section 382 imposes
limitations on the availability of a company’s net operating losses after a
more than 50 percentage point ownership change occurs.  As a result of a study (the “NOL Study”), it
was determined that ownership changes occurred in 2000 and 2002.  The amount of the Company’s net operating
losses incurred prior to each ownership change is limited (the “Loss
Limitation”) based on the value of the Company on the respective dates of
ownership change.  It is estimated that
the effect of Section 382 will reduce the amount of net operating loss
which is available to offset future taxable income to approximately $69 million
annually.  The estimate of the annual
Loss Limitation is based upon certain conclusions in the NOL Study pertaining
to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of


the Company on the dates of the ownership changes.  The overall determination of the Loss
Limitation and conclusions contained in the NOL Study are subject to
interpretation, and therefore, the annual Loss Limitation could be subject to
change.

At
December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $197 million of capital
loss carryforwards, which expire from December 31, 2005 to
December 31, 2007.  At
December 31, 2003, the Company also had approximately $1.4 million of
research credit carryforwards.  Such
credit carryforwards expire from December 31, 2019 to December 31,
2020.  These capital loss and research
credit carryforwards are also subject to annual limitation.

Approximately $747 million of the Company’s tax net
operating loss at December 31, 2003 relates to the exercise of stock
options which have been granted under the Company’s various stock option plans
and gives rise to compensation which is includable in the taxable income of the
applicable employees and deductible by the Company for federal and state income
tax purposes.  Additionally,
approximately $1.06 billion of the Company’s tax net operating loss relates to
the excess of tax deductions from the exercise of certain stock warrants
granted by the Company in excess of the associated warrant costs recorded for
financial accounting purposes. Finally, the Company recorded $6.8 million of
costs for financial reporting purposes in excess of the amount deductible for
tax purposes relating to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock held by certain
employees of the Company.

The Company has available for income tax purposes the
following net operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards (in
thousands).

(1)

Tax benefit, if and when
realized, will be recorded directly to Additional Paid-In Capital.

(2)

Loss carryforward period
in UK is indefinite.

The effective income tax rate of the Company is
different from the amount computed using applicable statutory federal rates as
a result of the following items (in thousands):


U.S. net income and foreign net loss were $14.2 million and $2.2
million, respectively.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

On January 6, 1999, the Company received notice that a third party
patent applicant and patent attorney, Thomas G. Woolston, purportedly had filed
in December 1998 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office a
request to declare an interference between a patent application filed by
Woolston and the Company’s U.S. Patent 5,794,207.  The Company is currently awaiting information from the Patent
Office regarding whether it will initiate an interference proceeding.

All of these cases have been assigned to
Judge Dominick J. Squatrito.  On
September 12, 2001, Judge Squatrito ordered that these cases be
consolidated under the Master File No. 3:00cv1884 (DJS), and he designated lead
plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs’ counsel. 
On October 29, 2001, plaintiffs served a Consolidated Amended
Complaint.  On February 5, 2002,
Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc., who is one of the lead plaintiffs in the
consolidated action, made a motion for leave to withdraw as lead
plaintiff.  The court has yet to rule on
that motion.  On February 28, 2002,
the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint.  That motion has been fully briefed.  The Court has yet to rule on that
motion.  On July 26 and
August 1, 2002, the Court issued scheduling orders concerning pretrial
proceedings.  The Company intends to
defend vigorously against this action. 
The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these suits or reasonably
estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

In addition, on November 1, 2000 the
Company was served with a complaint that purported to be a shareholder
derivative action against its Board of Directors and certain of its current and
former executive


officers, as well as the Company (as a nominal defendant).  The complaint alleged breach of fiduciary
duty and waste of corporate assets.  The
action is captioned Mark Zimmerman v. Richard Braddock, J. Walker, D. Schulman,
P. Allaire, R. Bahna, P. Blackney, W. Ford, M. Loeb, N. Nicholas, N. Peretsman,
and priceline.com Incorporated, 18473-NC (Court of Chancery of Delaware, County
of New Castle, State of Delaware).  On
February 6, 2001, all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure
to make a demand upon the Board of Directors and failure to state a cause of
action upon which relief can be granted. 
Pursuant to a stipulation by the parties, an amended complaint was filed
on June 21, 2001.  Defendants
renewed their motion to dismiss on August 20, 2001, and plaintiff served
his opposition to that motion on October 26, 2001.  Defendants filed their reply brief on
January 7, 2002.  On
December 20, 2002, the Court granted defendants’ motion without
prejudice.  On April 25, 2003, a
second amended complaint, adding H. Miller, was filed and a motion seeking
leave of court to file the second amended complaint was filed on July 28,
2003.  Defendants filed their opposition
to that motion on October 31, 2003. 
The Company intends to defend vigorously against this action.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of the suit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

On March 16, March 26,
April 27, and June 5, 2001, respectively, four putative class action
complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York naming priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul
Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc. and Salomon Smith
Barney, Inc. as defendants (01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ. 3590 and 01
Civ. 4956).  Shives

et al

. v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

., 01 Civ. 4956, also names other
defendants and states claims unrelated to the Company.  The complaints allege, among other things,
that priceline.com and the individual defendants violated the federal
securities laws by issuing and selling priceline.com common stock in
priceline.com’s March 1999 initial public offering without disclosing to
investors that some of the underwriters in the offering, including the lead
underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received excessive and undisclosed
commissions from certain investors.  By
Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these
cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes with hundreds of other cases,
which contain allegations concerning the allocation of shares in the initial
public offerings of companies other than priceline.com, Inc.  By Order of Judge Scheindlin dated August 14,
2001, the following cases were consolidated for all purposes:  01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576; and 01 Civ.
3590.  On April 19, 2002,
plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these cases.  This Consolidated Amended Class Action
Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with respect
to both the Company’s March 1999 initial public offering and the Company’s
August 1999 second public offering of common stock.  The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc.,
Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman,
Timothy G. Brier, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs &
Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson Stephens, Inc.
(as successor-in-interest to BancBoston), Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. (as
successor-in-interest to Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.),
Allen & Co., Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  Priceline, Richard Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Nancy
Peretsman, and Timothy Brier, together with other issuer defendants in the
consolidated litigation, filed a joint motion to dismiss on July 15,
2002.  On November 18, 2002, the
cases against the individual defendants were dismissed without prejudice and
without costs.  In addition, counsel for
plaintiffs and the individual defendants executed Reservation of Rights and
Tolling Agreements, which toll the statutes of limitations on plaintiffs’
claims against those individuals.  On
February 19, 2003, Judge Scheindlin issued an Opinion and Order granting
in part and denying in part the issuer’s motion.  None of the claims against the Company were dismissed.  On June 26, 2003, counsel for the
plaintiff class announced that they and counsel for the issuers had agreed to
the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Memorandum”) to settle claims
against the issuers.  The terms of that
Memorandum provide that class members will be guaranteed $1 billion dollars in
recoveries by the insurers of the issuers and that settling issuer defendants
will assign to the class members certain claims that they may have against the
underwriters.  Issuers also agree to
limit their abilities to bring certain claims against the underwriters.  If recoveries in excess of $1 billion
dollars are obtained by the class from any non-settling defendants, the
settling defendants’ monetary obligations to the class plaintiffs will be
satisfied; any amount recovered from the underwriters that is less than $1
billion will be paid by the insurers on behalf of the issuers.  The Memorandum, which is subject to the


approval of each issuer, was approved by a special committee of the
priceline.com Board of Directors on Thursday, July 3, 2003.  Any proposed settlement is subject to the
parties entering into a formal written agreement and final approval by the
Court.

On November 7, 2003, the Company was
served with a complaint that purported to be a shareholder derivative action
against its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former executive
officers, as well as the Company (as a nominal defendant).  The complaint alleged, among other things,
breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and misappropriation of
corporate information.  The claims in
the complaint appear to be substantially repetitive of the claims pending in
the derivative action in Delaware described above.  The action is captioned Don Powell v. Richard S. Braddock, Jay S.
Walker, Daniel H. Schulman, Paul A. Allaire, Ralph M. Bahna, Paul J. Blackney,
William E. Ford, Marshall Loeb, N. J. Nicholas, Jr., Nancy B. Peretsman, and
Heidi G. Miller and priceline.com Incorporated (Superior Court, Judicial
District of Stamford/Norwalk, State of Connecticut).  On February 27, 2004, defendants Braddock, Walker, Schulman,
Miller and priceline.com moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction and defendants Braddock and Schulman also moved to dismiss
the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The Company intends to defend vigorously against this
action.  The Company is unable to predict
the outcome of this suit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if
any.

On November 24, 2003, the Company was
served with a complaint for patent infringement captioned

IMX, Inc. v. E-Loan, Inc., InteractiveCorp,
LendingTree, Inc. and priceline.com Incorporated

.  The complaint alleges, among other things,
that the Company has infringed, induced others to infringe and/or committed
acts of contributory infringement of U.S. Patent number 5,995,947 entitled
“Interactive Mortgage and Loan Information and Real-Time Trading Systems.”  The complaint seeks injunctive relief;
unspecified money damages; an order directing defendants to pay IMX’s costs and
attorneys’ fees; and an award of pre-and post-judgment interest.  The Company intends to defend vigorously
against this action.  On
January 23, 2004, the Company answered the complaint, denying IMX’s
allegations, and filed a counterclaim, which seeks a declaration that the
patent-in-suit is invalid and/or that the Company does not infringe any claim
of the patent and that it does not contribute to or induce the infringement of
any claim of the patent.  The Company is
unable at this time to predict the outcome of this suit or reasonably estimate
a range of possible loss, if any.

From
time to time, the Company has been and expects to continue to be subject to
legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including
claims of alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights by
it.  Such claims, even if not
meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and
managerial resources and could adversely affect the Company’s business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Uncertainty
regarding payment of sales and hotel occupancy and other related taxes - The
Company is currently conducting a review and interpretation of the tax laws in
various states and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state and
local hotel occupancy and other related taxes. 
In connection with its review, the Company has met and had discussions
with taxing authorities in certain jurisdictions but the ultimate resolution in
any particular jurisdiction cannot be determined at this time.  Currently, hotels collect and remit hotel occupancy
and related taxes to the various tax authorities based on the amounts collected
by the hotels.  Consistent with this
practice, the Company recovers the taxes on the underlying cost of the hotel
room night from customers and remits the taxes to the hotel operators for
payment to the appropriate tax authorities. 
Several jurisdictions have indicated that they may take the position
that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the
price paid by a customer for the Company’s service and the cost to the Company
of the underlying room.  Historically,
the Company has not collected taxes on this differential.  Some state and local jurisdictions could
assert that the Company is subject to hotel occupancy taxes on this
differential and could seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively or
prospectively or both.  Such actions may
result in substantial liabilities for past sales and could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.  To the extent that any tax authority
succeeds in asserting that such a tax collection responsibility exists, it


is likely that, with respect to future transactions, the Company would
collect any such additional tax obligation from its customers, which would have
the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room nights to the Company’s
customers and, consequently, could reduce its hotel sales.  The Company will continue to assess the
risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the
extent appropriate, it will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

Worldspan,
L.P. Agreement - In October 2001, the Company entered into a long-term
worldwide technology agreement with Worldspan, L.P., pursuant to which
Worldspan, L.P. acts as the Company’s preferred global distribution system and
provides it with product development resources.  The current agreement, as amended, expires on December 31,
2007, and requires the Company to use Worldspan, L.P. for certain of its travel
bookings.  In return, the Company earns
a fee for such bookings.

Employment
Contracts - The Company has employment agreements with certain members of
senior management that provide for minimum annual compensation of approximately
$3.8 million in the aggregate. In some instances, the agreements provide for
periods of employment of up to three years. Generally, the agreements provide
for aggregated salary payments of up to approximately $4.0 million, accelerated
vesting of stock options upon, among other things, death or a termination other
than for “cause” or “good reason”, as those terms are defined in the
agreements, and a gross-up for the payment of parachute excise taxes.

Operating
Leases - The Company leases certain facilities and equipment through operating
leases. Rental expense for operating leases was approximately $2.2 million,
$2.5 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The Company’s executive, administrative, operating
offices and network operations center are located in approximately 92,000
square feet of leased office space located in Norwalk, Connecticut.  Minimum payments for operating leases having
initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows
(in thousands):

BENEFIT PLAN

Priceline.com
adopted a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan (the “Plan”) during 1998
covering all employees who are at least 21 years old and have completed 6
months of service. The Plan allows eligible employees to contribute up to 20%
of their eligible earnings, subject to a statutorily prescribed annual limit.  The Company may make matching contributions
on a discretionary basis to the Plan. All participants are fully vested in
their contributions and investment earnings. During the three years ended
December 31, 2003, the Company did not make any matching contributions to
the Plan.

OTHER RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS

In
October 2003, the Company restructured its relationship with
Hutchison-Priceline Limited (“Hutchison-Priceline”), a subsidiary of Hutchison
Whampoa Limited (“Hutchison”) whereby, among other things, the amount of shares
Hutchison-Priceline is authorized to issue was increased, and the par value of
Hutchison-Priceline common shares was decreased.  Pursuant to the restructuring agreement, the Company and
Hutchison converted their outstanding convertible notes into shares of Hutchison-Priceline,
and Hutchison purchased shares and was granted the right to purchase additional
shares in Hutchison-Priceline until March 2004.  After the restructuring, the Company and Hutchison own approximately
15% and 85%, respectively, of the outstanding equity securities of
Hutchison-Priceline.  Under the new
agreements, the Company continues to license its business model to
Hutchison-Priceline.  Hutchison and
Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited, a company affiliated with Hutchison, own
approximately 34% of the


Company’s outstanding common stock and hold three seats on its board of
directors.  The Company holds one seat
on Hutchison-Priceline’s board of directors.
