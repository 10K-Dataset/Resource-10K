PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October 1982. AMR’s operations fall
almost entirely in the airline industry. AMR’s principal subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc.
(American), was founded in 1934. On April 9, 2001, American (through a wholly owned subsidiary,
TWA Airlines LLC (TWA LLC)) purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), the eighth largest U.S. carrier at the time of the
transaction.

American is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2005, American
provided scheduled jet service to approximately 150 destinations throughout North America, the
Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and Asia. American is also one of the largest scheduled air
freight carriers in the world, providing a wide range of freight and mail services to shippers
throughout its system.

In addition, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR, owns two
regional airlines which do business as “American Eagle” — American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and
Executive Airlines, Inc. (Executive) (collectively, the American Eagle® carriers). American also
contracts with three independently owned regional airlines, which do business as the “American
Connection” (the American Connection® carriers). The American Eagle carriers and the American
Connection carriers provide connecting service from eight of American’s high-traffic cities to
smaller markets throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.

American Beacon Advisors, Inc. (American Beacon), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR, is responsible
for the investment and oversight of assets of AMR’s U.S. employee benefit plans, as well as AMR’s
short-term investments. It also serves as the investment manager of the American Beacon Funds, a
family of mutual funds with both institutional and retail shareholders, and provides customized
fixed income portfolio management services. As of December 31, 2005, American Beacon was
responsible for the management of approximately $42.7 billion in assets, including direct
management of approximately $18.8 billion in short-term fixed income investments.

Recent Events

The Company incurred an $861 million net loss in 2005 compared to a net loss of $761 million in
2004. The Company’s results were impacted by the continuing increase in fuel prices and certain
other costs, somewhat offset by an improvement in revenues and productivity improvements and other
cost reductions resulting from progress under the Turnaround Plan.

The average price per gallon of fuel increased 33.9 cents from 2003 to 2004 and 51.9 cents from
2004 to 2005. These price increases negatively impacted fuel expense by $1.1 billion and $1.7
billion in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Continuing high fuel prices, additional increases in the
price of fuel, and/or disruptions in the supply of fuel would further adversely affect the
Company’s financial condition and its results of operations.

In order to fund its losses and limited capital spending during 2005 and to bolster its liquidity,
the Company completed several financing transactions during the year.

•

American re-marketed $198 million of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Facility Improvement
Corporation Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2000A, due May 1, 2029.

•

The New York City Industrial Development Agency issued $800 million of special facility revenue bonds on
behalf of American, and $491 million of bond proceeds was paid to American to reimburse prior
construction costs.

•

American sold and leased back 89 spare engines for net proceeds of $133 million.



•

American purchased certain obligations due October 2006 with a face value of $261 million at par
value from an institutional investor. In conjunction with the purchase, American borrowed an
additional $245 million under an existing mortgage agreement with a final maturity in December
2012 from the same investor.

•

AMR issued 13 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $223 million.

•

AMR Eagle borrowed approximately $319 million (net of discount), under various debt agreements, related
to the purchase of regional jet aircraft.

The Company’s ability to become profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on
an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely beyond the Company’s
control. Some of the risk factors that affect the Company’s business and financial results are
discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A. As the Company seeks to improve its financial
condition, it must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce
its costs. Although the Company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and
revenue challenges, the ultimate success of these initiatives is not known at this time and cannot
be assured. It will be very difficult, absent continued restructuring of its operations, for the
Company to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, or to become profitable, if the
overall industry revenue environment does not continue to improve and fuel prices remain at
historically high levels for an extended period.

Competition

Domestic Air Transportation

The domestic airline industry is fiercely competitive. Currently,
any U.S. air carrier deemed fit by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is free to operate
scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its possessions. Most major
air carriers have developed hub-and-spoke systems and schedule patterns in an effort to maximize
the revenue potential of their service. American operates five hubs: Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW),
Chicago O’Hare, Miami, St. Louis and San Juan, Puerto Rico. United Air Lines (United) also has a
hub operation at Chicago O’Hare. Delta Air Lines (Delta) previously operated a hub at DFW. In
January 2005, however, Delta ceased hub operations at DFW.

The American Eagle® carriers increase the number of markets the Company serves by providing
connections at American’s hubs and certain other major airports — Boston, Los Angeles,
Raleigh/Durham and New York’s LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports. The American
Connection® carriers provide connecting service to American through St. Louis. American’s
competitors also own or have marketing agreements with regional carriers which provide similar
services at their major hubs and other locations.

On most of its domestic non-stop routes, the Company faces competing service from at least one, and
sometimes more than one, domestic airline including: AirTran Airways, Alaska Airlines, ATA
Airlines, Continental Airlines (Continental), Delta, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Northwest
Airlines (Northwest), Southwest Airlines (Southwest), United, US Airways and their affiliated
regional carriers. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the
major airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, the Company faces competition on
some of its routes from carriers operating point-to-point service on such routes. The Company also
competes with all-cargo and charter carriers and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail
transportation. On all of its routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need
to meet competition from other airlines.

The Company must also compete with carriers that have recently reorganized or are reorganizing,
including under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. It is possible that one or
more other competitors may seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11. Successful reorganizations
present the Company with competitors with significantly lower operating costs derived from
renegotiated labor, supply and financing contracts.

International Air Transportation

In addition to its extensive domestic service, the Company
provides international service to the Caribbean, Canada, Latin America, Europe and Asia. The
Company’s operating revenues from foreign operations were approximately 36 percent of the Company’s
total operating revenues in 2005, and 35 and 27 percent of the Company’s total operating revenues
in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additional information about the Company’s foreign operations is
included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.



In providing international air transportation, the Company competes with foreign investor-owned
carriers, foreign state-owned carriers and U.S. airlines that have been granted authority to
provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations. The
major U.S. air carriers have some advantage over foreign competitors in their ability to generate
traffic from their extensive domestic route systems. In some cases, however, foreign governments
limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to carry passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign
countries. To improve access to each other’s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers -
including American — have established marketing relationships with other airlines and rail
companies. American currently has marketing relationships with Aer Lingus, Air Pacific, Air
Sahara, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern Airlines,
Deutsche Bahn, EL AL, EVA Air, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Lan
Airlines, Mexicana, Qantas Airways, SN Brussels, SNCF, Swiss International Air Lines, the TAM Group
and Turkish Airlines. In the coming years, the Company expects to develop these programs further
and to evaluate new alliances with other carriers.

American is also a founding member of the

one

world alliance, which includes Aer Lingus, British
Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Lan Airlines, Iberia, and Qantas. In addition,

one

world has
extended invitations to Japan Airlines, Malev and Royal Jordanian. The

one

world alliance links the
networks of the member carriers to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the
destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers’ frequent flyer programs and
access to the carriers’ airport lounge facilities. Several of American’s major competitors are
members of marketing/operational alliances that enjoy antitrust immunity. American and British
Airways, the largest members of the

one

world alliance, are restricted in their relationship because
they lack antitrust immunity. They are, therefore, at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other
alliances that have antitrust immunity.

Price Competition

The airline industry is characterized by substantial and intense price
competition. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the
Company’s financial results because the Company is generally required to match competitors’ fares
because failing to match would provide even less revenue because of customers’ price sensitivity.

During recent years, a number of low-cost carriers (LCCs) have entered the domestic market.
Several major airlines, including the Company, have implemented efforts to lower their costs since
lower cost structures enable airlines to offer lower fares. In addition, several air carriers have
recently reorganized or are reorganizing, including under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code, including United, Delta, US Airways and Northwest Airlines. Reorganization will
allow these carriers to decrease operating costs. In the past, lower cost structures have
generally resulted in fare reductions. If fare reductions are not offset by increases in passenger
traffic, changes in the mix of traffic that improve yields (passenger revenue per passenger mile)
and/or cost reductions, the Company’s operating results will be negatively impacted.

Distribution Systems

The growing use of electronic ticket distribution systems provides the
Company with an opportunity to lower its distribution costs. However, the continuous increase in
pricing transparency resulting from the use of the Internet has enabled cost-conscious customers to
more easily obtain the lowest fare on any given route. The Company continues to expand the
capabilities of its Internet website — AA.com — and the use of electronic ticketing throughout the
Company’s network. In addition, the Company has marketing agreements with various Internet travel
services.

The Company anticipates additional reductions of distribution costs as it renegotiates certain
agreements with global distribution system providers in 2006. The Company will continue to explore
distribution cost reduction opportunities with traditional distribution channels and providers of
alternative distribution technologies.



Although the majority of the tickets for travel on American and the American Eagle® carriers
continue to be sold by travel agents, American no longer pays base commissions on tickets issued by
travel agents in the United States, Puerto Rico, certain countries in Latin America, Canada, United
Kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium. In addition, American has been actively pursuing reducing base
commissions for other international points of sale. American continues, however, to pay certain
incentive commissions to travel agents in connection with special revenue programs. American
believes that other carriers also pay certain incentive commissions in connection with their own
special revenue programs. Accordingly, airlines compete not only with respect to the price of the
tickets sold, but also with respect to the amount of special revenue program commissions that may
be paid.

The Company also establishes incentive programs with corporate customers to increase revenues. The
Company believes that its network breadth and local market presence in key cities allow it to have
some advantages with corporate customers over other competitors.

Regulation

General

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most domestic economic
regulation of passenger and freight transportation. However, the DOT and the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) still exercise certain regulatory authority over air carriers. The DOT
maintains jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, international route
authorities and certain consumer protection and competition matters, such as advertising, denied
boarding compensation and baggage liability.

The FAA regulates flying operations generally, including establishing personnel, aircraft and
certain security standards. As part of that oversight, the FAA has implemented a number of
requirements that the Company has incorporated and is incorporating into its maintenance programs.
The Company is progressing toward the completion of over 100 airworthiness directives including ATR
Alpha thermal blanket replacements, enhanced ground proximity warning systems, McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 main landing gear piston improvements, Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 pylon improvements, Boeing
737 elevator and rudder improvements and Airbus A300 structural improvements. Based on its current
implementation schedule, the Company expects to be in compliance with the applicable requirements
within the required time periods.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal
Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.
Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which
vests in the National Mediation Board certain regulatory functions with respect to disputes between
airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements.

International

International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. The
Company’s operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between
the U.S. and the respective countries or governmental authorities (such as the European Union), and
in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign
governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction
and regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various
foreign governments of countries served by the Company are periodically subject to renegotiation.
Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or
termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, or otherwise adversely
affect the Company’s international operations. In addition, at some foreign airports, an air
carrier needs slots (landing and take-off authorizations) before the air carrier can introduce new
service or increase existing service. The availability of such slots is not assured and the
inability of the Company to obtain and retain needed slots could therefore inhibit its efforts to
compete in certain international markets.



The Company is one of four carriers that have exclusive rights to fly routes between London
Heathrow airport and the United States. The United States government and the European Union are
currently evaluating the possibility of allowing a greater number of carriers to fly these routes.
To the extent additional carriers are granted the right to fly between Heathrow and the United
States in the future, and are able to obtain the necessary slots and terminal facilities, the
Company could suffer an adverse financial impact. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional
information.

Security

In November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted in the
United States. The ATSA created a new government agency, the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security and is responsible for
aviation security. The ATSA mandates that the TSA provide for the screening of all passengers and
property, including U.S. mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be
carried aboard a passenger aircraft. The ATSA also provides for increased security in flight decks
of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights.

Effective February 1, 2002, the ATSA imposed a $2.50 per enplanement security service fee ($5
one-way maximum fee), which is being collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government
to pay for these enhanced security measures. Additionally, air carriers are annually required to
submit to the government an amount equal to what the air carriers paid for screening passengers and
property in 2000. President Bush has sought to increase both of these fees under spending
proposals for the Department of Homeland Security. American and other carriers have announced their
opposition to these proposals as there is no assurance that any increase in fees could be passed on
to customers.

Airline Fares

Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental
regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but
applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are
sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which the Company
serves. While air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs,
substantial commissions, fare overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers
characterize many international markets.

Airport Access

The FAA has designated New York John F. Kennedy (JFK), New York LaGuardia
(LaGuardia), and Washington Reagan airports as high-density traffic airports. The high-density
rule limits the number of Instrument Flight Rule operations — take-offs and landings — permitted
per hour and requires that a slot support each operation. In April 2000, the Wendell H. Ford
Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21

st

Century (Air 21 Act) was enacted. It
will eliminate slot restrictions at JFK and LaGuardia airports in 2007. The Company expects that
the elimination of these slot restrictions could create operational challenges, but does not expect
the elimination of these slot restrictions to have a material adverse impact on the Company.

Currently, the FAA permits the purchasing, selling, leasing or transferring of slots, except those
slots designated as international, essential air service or Air 21 Act slots (certain slots at JFK,
LaGuardia, and Washington Reagan airports). Trading of any domestic slot is permitted subject to
certain parameters. Some foreign airports, including London Heathrow, a major European destination
for American, also have slot allocations. Most foreign authorities do not officially recognize the
purchasing, selling or leasing of slots.

In addition, the Wright Amendment authorizes certain flight operations at Dallas Love Field within
limited geographic areas. Southwest is actively lobbying to expand the authorization and, in
November 2005, legislation was passed that added the State of Missouri to the areas that may be
served to and from Love Field. The Company subsequently announced that it plans to provide service
at Love Field in order to protect market share. The Company vigorously opposes any further
expansion of the geographic service areas of Love Field because such expansion could have an
adverse financial impact on the Company.

Although the Company is constrained by slots, it currently has sufficient slot authorizations to
operate its existing flights. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to
obtain slots in the future to expand its operations or change its schedules because, among other
factors, slot allocations are subject to changes in government policies.



Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to various laws and government regulations
concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries.
U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on the Company include the Airport Noise and
Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the
Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act). Certain operations of the Company
are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact
on the Company’s operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been
delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local
governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of
which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.

The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise
abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign
commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated
aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The ANCA
generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft. While the Company has had
sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, the
Company’s operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more
restrictive or widespread.

American has been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for contamination at the former
Operating Industries, Inc. Landfill in Monterrey Park, CA (OII). American’s alleged volumetric
contributions at OII are small when compared with those of other PRPs. American is participating
with a number of other PRPs in a Steering Committee that has conducted extensive negotiations with
the EPA and state officials in recent years. Members of the Steering Committee, including
American, have entered into a series of partial consent decrees with EPA and the State of
California which address specific aspects of investigation and cleanup at OII. To date, American
has paid approximately $1 million toward its share of cleanup costs under those consent decrees.
Together with a number of other small-volume PRPs at OII, American seeks a settlement that will
enable it to resolve all of its remaining past and present liabilities at OII in exchange for a
one-time, lump-sum settlement payment. The amount of American’s potential contribution towards
such a settlement is not yet known, but American expects that its payment will be immaterial.

American also has been named as a PRP for contamination at the Double Eagle Superfund Site in
Oklahoma City, OK (Double Eagle). American’s alleged volumetric contributions are small when
compared with those of other PRPs. American is participating with a number of other PRPs at Double
Eagle in a Joint Defense Group that is actively conducting settlement negotiations with the EPA and
state officials. The group is seeking a settlement on behalf of its members that will enable
American to resolve its past and present liabilities at Double Eagle in exchange for a one-time,
lump-sum settlement payment. American expects that its payment will be immaterial.

American, along with most other tenants at the San Francisco International Airport (SFIA), has been
ordered by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board to engage in various studies of
potential environmental contamination at the airport and to undertake remedial measures, if
necessary. In 1997, the SFIA pursued a cost recovery action in the U.S. District Court of Northern
California against certain airport tenants to recover past and future costs associated with
historic airport contamination. American entered an initial settlement for accrued past costs in
2000 for $850,000. In 2004, American resolved its liability for all remaining past and future
costs. Based on SFIA’s cost projections, the value of American’s second settlement is
approximately $4 million payable over a 30 year period.

Miami-Dade County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating various environmental
conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs through
landing fees and various cost recovery methods. American and AMR Eagle have been named PRPs for
the contamination at MIA. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information.



In 1999, American was ordered by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
(NYSDEC) to conduct remediation of environmental contamination located at Terminals 8 and 9 at JFK.
American is seeking to recover a portion of the JFK remediation costs from previous users of the
Terminals 8 and 9 premises. In 2004, American entered a Consent Order with NYSDEC for the
remediation of a JFK off-terminal hangar facility. American expects that the projected costs
associated with the JFK remediations will be immaterial.

In 1996, American and Executive, along with other tenants at the Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU) were notified by the SJU Port Authority that it considered
them potentially responsible for environmental contamination at the airport. In 2003, the SJU Port
Authority requested that American, among other airport tenants, fund an ongoing subsurface
investigation and site assessment. American denied liability for the related costs. No further
action has been taken against American or Executive.

American Eagle has been notified of its potential liability under New York law at an inactive
hazardous waste site in Poughkeepsie, New York. Pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent
entered into with NYSDEC, American Eagle is implementing a final remedy to address contamination at
the site. The costs of this final remedy are immaterial.

The Company does not expect these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material adverse
impact on the Company. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

Labor

The airline business is labor intensive. Wages, salaries and benefits represented approximately 32
percent of the Company’s consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
average full-time equivalent number of employees of the Company’s subsidiaries for the year ended
December 31, 2005 was 88,400.

The majority of these employees are represented by labor unions and covered by collective
bargaining agreements. Relations with such labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor
Act (RLA). Under this act, the collective bargaining agreements among the Company’s subsidiaries
and these organizations generally do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date.
If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in
the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must
meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National
Mediation Board (NMB) to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the
NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is
declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit
to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period
commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established,
which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days
and is followed by another “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period,
unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may strike
and the airline may resort to “self-help”, including the imposition of any or all of its proposed
amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.

In April 2003, American reached agreements with its three major unions — the Allied Pilots
Association (the APA), the Transport Workers Union of America (AFL-CIO) (the TWU) and the
Association of Professional Flight Attendants (the APFA) (the Labor Agreements). The Labor
Agreements substantially reduced the labor costs associated with the employees represented by the
unions. In conjunction with the Labor Agreements, American implemented various changes in the pay
plans and benefits for non-unionized personnel, including officers and other management (the
Management Reductions). While the parties may begin contract discussions in 2006 under the Labor
Agreements, the agreements do not become amendable until 2008.



The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents American Eagle pilots, reached agreement
with American Eagle effective September 1, 1997, to have all of the pilots of the American Eagle®
carriers covered by a single contract. This agreement lasts until October 31, 2013. The agreement
provides to the parties the right to seek limited changes in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. If the
parties are unable to agree on the limited changes, the agreement provides that any issues would be
resolved by interest arbitration, without the exercise of self-help (such as a strike). ALPA and
American Eagle negotiated a tentative agreement in 2000, but that agreement failed in ratification.
Thereafter, the parties participated in interest arbitration. The interest arbitration panel
determined the limited changes that should be made and these changes were appropriately effected.
In 2004, the parties successfully negotiated limited changes that became effective on January 1,
2005.

The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), which represents the flight attendants of the American
Eagle carriers, reached agreement with American Eagle effective March 2, 1998, to have all flight
attendants of the American Eagle carriers covered by a single contract. The agreement became
amendable on September 2, 2001. The parties agreed to commence negotiations in March 2001.
Thereafter, the mediation assistance of the NMB was requested and mediation commenced in November
2003. The parties reached an agreement that was ratified by the membership in October 2005. The new
agreement is amendable on October 27, 2009; however, the parties have agreed that contract openers
may be exchanged 90 days prior to that date.

The other union employees at the American Eagle carriers are covered by separate agreements with
the TWU, which were effective April 28, 1998, and were amendable April 28, 2003. American Eagle and
the TWU reached agreements with respect to the TWU-represented work groups at various times in late
2004 and early 2005. The new agreements are amendable beginning with dates ranging from October 1,
2007 to January 26, 2008; however, the parties have agreed that contract openers may be exchanged
at least 60 days prior to October 1, 2007.

The impact of fuel price changes on the Company and its competitors depends on various factors,
including hedging strategies. The Company has a fuel hedging program in which it enters into jet
fuel, heating oil and crude oil hedging contracts to dampen the impact of the volatility of jet
fuel prices. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s fuel hedging program reduced the Company’s
fuel expense by approximately $64 million, $99 million and $149 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company had hedged, with option contracts, including collars, approximately
17 percent of its estimated 2006 fuel requirements and insignificant amounts of its estimated fuel
requirements thereafter. The consumption hedged for 2006 is capped at an average price of
approximately $60 per barrel of crude oil. A deterioration of the Company’s financial position
could negatively affect the Company’s ability to hedge fuel in the future. See the Risk Factors
under Item 1A for additional information regarding fuel.

Additional information regarding the Company’s fuel program is also included in Item 7(A) –
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and in Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements.



Frequent Flyer Program

American established the AAdvantage frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) to develop passenger
loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. The Company believes that
the AAdvantage program is one of its competitive strengths. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits
by flying on American or American Eagle, or by using services of other program participants,
including bank credit card issuers, hotels, car rental companies and other retail companies.
American sells mileage credits and related services to the other companies participating in the
program. American reserves the right to change the AAdvantage program at any time without notice
and may end the program with six months notice.

Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle
or other participating airlines, or for other travel industry awards. Once a member accrues
sufficient mileage for an award, the member may book award travel. Most travel awards are subject
to capacity controlled seating. Mileage credit does not expire, provided a customer has any type
of qualifying activity at least once every 36 months. See Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates under Item 7 for more information on AAdvantage.

Other Matters

Seasonality and Other Factors

The Company’s results of operations for any interim period are not
necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, since the air transportation business is
subject to seasonal fluctuations. Higher demand for air travel has traditionally resulted in more
favorable operating and financial results for the second and third quarters of the year than for
the first and fourth quarters. Fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel
prices, labor actions, weather and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Unaudited
quarterly financial data for the two-year period ended December 31, 2005 is included in Note 15 to
the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the results of operations in the air
transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general
economic conditions.

No material part of the business of AMR and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or
very few customers. Consequently, the loss of the Company’s largest few customers would not have a
materially adverse effect upon the Company.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property
damage and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft.

As a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (the Terrorist Attacks), aviation
insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air
carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts
of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these insurers
significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in general.

The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines
until August 31, 2006 covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. In
addition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2006, at his
discretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the U.S. government does
not extend the policy beyond August 31, 2006, the Company will attempt to purchase similar coverage
with narrower scope from commercial insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is
not available at commercially reasonable rates, the Company would be adversely affected. While the
price of commercial insurance has declined since the premium increases immediately after the
Terrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of
insurance coverage available to the Company, or significantly increase its cost, the Company would
be adversely affected.



Other Government Matters

In time of war or during a national emergency or defense oriented
situation, American and other air carriers can be required to provide airlift services to the Air
Mobility Command under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program. In the event the Company has to provide
a substantial number of aircraft and crew to the Air Mobility Command, its operations could be
adversely impacted. The Company currently receives compensation for participating in the program,
even though it is not providing airlift services to the U.S. Government at this time.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our ability to become profitable and our ability to continue to fund our obligations on an ongoing
basis will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond our control. Some
of the factors that may have a negative impact on us are described below:

As a result of significant losses in recent years, our financial condition has been materially
weakened.

We have incurred significant losses in recent years: $861 million in 2005, $761 million in 2004,
$1.2 billion in 2003, $3.5 billion in 2002 and $1.8 billion in 2001. As a result, our financial
condition has been materially weakened, and we remain vulnerable both to unexpected events (such as
additional terrorist attacks or a sudden spike in jet fuel prices) and to general declines in the
operating environment (such as that resulting from a recession or significant increased
competition).

Our initiatives to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce our costs may not be
adequate or successful.

As we seek to improve our financial condition, we must continue to take steps to generate
additional revenues and to significantly reduce our costs. Although we have a number of
initiatives underway to address our cost and revenue challenges, a number of these initiatives
involve significant changes to our business which we may be unable to implement. The adequacy and
ultimate success of our initiatives to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce our
costs are not known at this time and cannot be assured. Moreover, whether our initiatives will be
adequate or successful depends in large measure on factors beyond our control, notably the overall
industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth, and fuel
prices. It will be very difficult, absent continued restructuring of our operations, for us to
continue to fund our obligations on an ongoing basis, or to become profitable, if the overall
industry revenue environment does not continue to improve and fuel prices remain at historically
high levels for an extended period.

Our business is affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, and our
results of operations tend to be volatile.

Our business, and that of the rest of the airline industry, is affected by many changing economic
and other conditions largely outside of our control, including among others:

As a result, our results of operations tend to be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected
change. In addition, many of the factors that can have a material impact on our business and our
results of operations are beyond our control.



Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business and
liquidity.

We have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and obligations to make
future payments on aircraft equipment and property leases. We may incur substantial additional
debt, including secured debt, and lease obligations in the future. We also have substantial, and
increasing, pension funding obligations. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could
have important consequences. For example, they could:

We may be unable to comply with our financial covenants.

American has a fully drawn $788 million Credit Facility, which consists of a $540 million Revolving
Facility with a final maturity on June 17, 2009 and a $248 million Term Loan Facility with a final
maturity on December 17, 2010. The Credit Facility contains a liquidity covenant and a ratio of
cash flow to fixed charges covenant. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31,
2005 and expect to be able to continue to comply with these covenants for the period ending March
31, 2006. However, given the historically high price of fuel and the volatility of fuel prices and
revenues, it is difficult to assess whether we will, in fact, be able to continue to comply with
these covenants, and there are no assurances that we will be able to comply with these covenants.
Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the Credit Facility which -
- - if we did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default — - could
result in a default under a significant amount of our other debt and lease obligations, and
otherwise adversely affect our business.

We are being adversely affected by increases in fuel prices, and we would be adversely affected by
disruptions in the supply of fuel.

Our results are very significantly affected by the price and availability of jet fuel. Fuel prices
increased significantly in 2005 and remain high.

Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, we may not be able to pass on increased fuel
prices to customers by increasing fares. In fact, recent history would indicate that we have
limited ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel. If fuel prices decline in the future,
increased fare competition and lower revenues may offset any potential benefit of lower fuel
prices.

While we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability, dependency on
foreign imports of crude oil, limited refining capacity and the possibility of changes in
government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to
predict the future availability of jet fuel. If there is an outbreak of hostilities or other
conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere or a reduction in refining capacity (due to weather
events, for example), there could be reductions in the supply of jet fuel and significant increases
in the cost of jet fuel. Major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases
in its cost, or a continuation of current high prices for a significant period of time, would
adversely affect our business.

While we seek to manage the price risk of fuel costs by using derivative contracts, there can be no
assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particular
level of protection against increased fuel costs. In addition, a deterioration of our financial
position could negatively affect our ability to enter into derivative contracts in the future.



The airline industry is fiercely competitive and fares are at historically low levels.

Service over almost all of our routes is highly competitive and fares remain at historically low
levels. We face vigorous, and in some cases, increasing competition from major domestic airlines,
national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers, LCCs, and, particularly
on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation. We also face increasing and significant
competition from marketing/operational alliances formed by our competitors. In addition, the
competitive landscape we face would be altered substantially by industry consolidation, including
merger, equity investment and joint venture transactions. The percentage of routes on which we
compete with carriers having substantially lower operating costs than ours has grown significantly
over the past decade, and we now compete with LCCs on 75 percent of our domestic network.

Certain alliances have been granted immunity from anti-trust regulations by governmental
authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent
alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our
ability to effectively compete may be hindered.

Pricing decisions are significantly affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discounting
by competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we must
generally match competitors’ fares, since failing to match would result in even less revenue. More
recently, we have faced increased competition from carriers with simplified fare structures, which
are generally preferred by travelers. Any fare reduction or fare simplification initiative may not
be offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction in costs or changes in the mix of traffic
that would improve yields. Moreover, decisions by our competitors that increase – or reduce –
overall industry capacity, or capacity dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign region, market
or route, can have a material impact on related fare levels.

We compete with reorganized and reorganizing carriers, which may result in competitive
disadvantages for us or fare discounting.

We must compete with air carriers that have recently reorganized or are reorganizing, including
under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, including United, the second largest
U.S. air carrier, Delta, the third largest U.S. air carrier and Northwest, the fourth largest U.S.
air carrier. It is possible that other competitors may seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11.
With the Chapter 11 filings of Delta and Northwest, two out of the four largest U.S. air carriers
are now operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, with United just having emerged from
Chapter 11. We cannot reliably predict the outcome of these proceedings or the consequences of
such a large portion of the airline industry’s capacity being provided by bankrupt or recently
reorganized air carriers.

Successful reorganizations by other carriers present us with competitors with significantly lower
operating costs and a stronger financial position derived from renegotiated labor, supply, and
financing contracts, which could lead to fare reductions. These competitive pressures may limit
our ability to adequately price our services, may require us to further reduce our operating costs,
and could have a material adverse impact on us.

Our reduced pricing power adversely affects our ability to achieve adequate pricing, especially
with respect to business travel.

Our passenger yield remains depressed by historical standards. We believe this depressed passenger
yield is due in large part to a corresponding decline in our pricing power. Our reduced pricing
power is the product of several factors including: greater cost sensitivity on the part of
travelers (particularly business travelers); pricing transparency resulting from the use of the
Internet; greater competition from LCCs and from carriers that have recently reorganized or are
reorganizing including under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; other carriers
being well hedged against rising fuel costs and able to better absorb the current high jet fuel
prices; and, more recently, fare simplification efforts by certain carriers. We believe that our
reduced pricing power will persist indefinitely and possibly permanently.



We need to raise additional funds to maintain sufficient liquidity, but we may be unable to do so
on acceptable terms.

To maintain sufficient liquidity as we continue to implement our restructuring and cost reduction
initiatives, and because we have significant debt, lease, pension and other obligations in the next
several years, we will need continued access to additional funding.

Our ability to obtain future financing has been reduced because we have fewer unencumbered assets
available than in years past. A very large majority of our aircraft assets (including virtually
all of the aircraft eligible for the benefits of Section 1110 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) have
been encumbered. Also, the market value of our aircraft assets has declined in recent years and
those assets may not maintain their current market value.

Since the Terrorist Attacks, our credit ratings have been lowered to significantly below investment
grade. These reductions have increased our borrowing costs and otherwise adversely affected
borrowing terms, and limited borrowing options. Additional reductions in our credit ratings could
further increase borrowing or other costs and further restrict the availability of future
financing.

A number of other factors, including our recent financial results, our substantial indebtedness,
the difficult revenue environment we face, our reduced credit ratings, high fuel prices, and the
financial difficulties experienced in the airline industry, adversely affect the availability and
terms of financing for us. As a result, there can be no assurance that financing will be available
to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to obtain additional financing on acceptable
terms would have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our operations over
the long term.

Our business strategy may change.

We evaluate our assets on an ongoing basis with a view to maximizing their value to us and
determining which are core to our operations. We also regularly evaluate our business strategy.
We may change our business strategy in the future and may not pursue our current goals.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which can result in increases in our
costs, limits on our operating flexibility and competitive disadvantages.

Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Many of
these requirements result in significant costs. For example, the FAA from time to time issues
directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft, and
compliance with those requirements drives significant expenditures. In addition, the ability of
U.S. carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable
arrangements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, or
because appropriate slots or facilities are not made available.

Moreover, additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been enacted from
time to time that have significantly increased the costs of airline operations, reduced the demand
for air travel or restricted the way we can conduct our business. For example, the Aviation and
Transportation Security Act, which became law in 2001, mandates the federalization of certain
airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airlines. Similar laws
or regulations or other governmental actions in the future may adversely affect our business and
financial results.



Our results of operations may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by
governmental agencies having jurisdiction over our operations, including:

In November 2005, the United States and the European Union reached a tentative air services
agreement that would provide airlines from the United States and E.U. member states open access to
each other’s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly beyond the United States
and both within and beyond the E.U. The tentative agreement is subject to approval by the E.U.
Transport Council of Ministers. Under the agreement, every U.S. and E.U. airline would be
authorized to operate between airports in the United States and London’s Heathrow Airport. Only
three airlines besides American are currently allowed to provide that service and Heathrow routes
have historically been among our most profitable. The agreement, if approved, would result in our
facing increased competition in serving Heathrow if additional carriers are able to obtain
necessary slots and terminal facilities.

We currently serve the Dallas/Fort Worth area solely from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport
(DFW). Southwest Airlines is actively seeking repeal of the Wright Amendment, which is a law that
authorizes flight operations at Dallas Love Field within limited geographic areas. In November
2005, legislation was passed that added the State of Missouri to the areas that may be served to
and from Love Field, and we subsequently announced that we plan to provide service at Love Field in
order to protect market share. Splitting our Dallas/Fort Worth operations between DFW and Love
Field impairs the efficiency and profitability of our hub operations at DFW, and further expansion
of the authorized geographic service areas could have an adverse financial impact on us.

We could be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks.

The increased threat of U.S. military involvement in overseas operations has, on occasion, had an
adverse impact on our business, financial position (including access to capital markets) and
results of operations, and on the airline industry in general. Furthermore, during 2003, the war
in Iraq had a significant adverse impact on international and domestic revenues and future
bookings. The continuing conflict in Iraq, or other conflicts or events in the Middle East or
elsewhere, may result in similar adverse impacts.

The Terrorist Attacks had a material adverse impact on us. The occurrence of another terrorist
attack (whether domestic or international and whether against us or another entity) could again
have a material adverse impact on us.

Our international operations could be adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or
government actions beyond our control.

Our current international activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such as
reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls, currency and political
risks, taxation and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the
inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots.



We could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior.

In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which primarily had an
adverse impact on our Asia operations. More recently, there have been concerns about a potential
outbreak of avian flu. If there were another outbreak of a disease (such as SARS or avian flu)
that affects travel behavior, it could have a material adverse impact on us.

We could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relations with any
unionized or other employee work group.

Our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with any
labor union representing our employees. In addition, any dispute we have with, or any disruption
by, an employee work group (outside the confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could
adversely impact us. Moreover, one of the fundamental tenets of our strategic Turnaround Plan is
increased union and employee involvement in our operations. To the extent we are unable to
maintain satisfactory relations with any unionized or other employee work group, our ability to
execute our strategic plans would be adversely affected.

Our insurance costs have increased substantially and further increases in insurance costs or
reductions in coverage could have an adverse impact on us.

We carry insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and all-risk coverage
for damage to our aircraft. As a result of the Terrorist Attacks, aviation insurers significantly
reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to
persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or
similar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these insurers significantly increased the
premiums for aviation insurance in general.

The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines
until August 31, 2006, covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. In
addition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2006, at his
discretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the U.S. government does
not extend the policy beyond August 31, 2006, we will attempt to purchase similar coverage with
narrower scope from commercial insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is not
available at commercially reasonable rates, we would be adversely affected.

While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the premium increase immediately after
the Terrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of
insurance coverage available to us, or significantly increase its cost, we would be adversely
affected.

We may be unable to retain key management personnel.

Since the Terrorist Attacks, several of our key management employees have elected to retire early
or leave for more financially favorable opportunities at other companies. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to retain our key management employees. Any inability to retain our key
management employees, or attract and retain additional qualified management employees, could have a
negative impact on us.

We could be adversely affected by a failure or disruption of our computer, communications or other
technology systems.

We are increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business. The computer and
communications systems on which we rely could be disrupted due to events beyond our control,
including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment failures, software
failures and computer viruses and hackers. We have taken certain steps to help reduce the risk of
some (but not all) of these potential disruptions. There can be no assurance, however, that the
measures we have taken are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions or failures of these systems.
Any substantial or repeated failure of these systems could impact our operations and customer
service, result in the loss of important data, loss of revenues, increased costs and generally harm
our business. Moreover, a catastrophic failure of certain of our vital systems (which we believe
is a remote possibility) could limit our ability to operate our flights for an indefinite period of
time, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and our business.

Substantially all of the Company’s aircraft leases include an option to purchase the aircraft
or to extend the lease term, or both, with the purchase price or renewal rental to be based
essentially on the market value of the aircraft at the end of the term of the lease or at a
predetermined fixed amount.

Ground Properties

The Company leases, or has built as leasehold improvements on leased property: most of its airport
and terminal facilities; its training facilities in Fort Worth, Texas; its principal overhaul and
maintenance bases at Tulsa International Airport (Tulsa, Oklahoma), Kansas City International
Airport (Kansas City, Missouri) and Alliance Airport (Fort Worth, Texas); its headquarters building
in Fort Worth, Texas; its regional reservation offices; and local ticket and administration offices
throughout the system. American has entered into agreements with the Tulsa Municipal Airport
Trust; the Alliance Airport Authority, Fort Worth, Texas; the New York City Industrial Development
Agency; and the Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O’Hare, Newark, San Juan, and Los Angeles airport
authorities to provide funds for constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring
equipment which are or will be leased to the Company. The Company also uses public airports for
its flight operations under lease or use arrangements with the municipalities or governmental
agencies owning or controlling them and leases certain other ground equipment for use at its
facilities.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On July 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in November 1999 an amended complaint was
filed, against AMR, American, AMR Eagle, Airlines Reporting Corporation, and the Sabre Group
Holdings, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Western
Division (

Westways World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp., et al.

). The lawsuit alleges that
requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos to American for violations of American’s fare rules
(by customers of the agencies): (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American and
AMR Eagle and the plaintiffs; (2) constitutes unjust enrichment; and (3) violates the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). On July 9, 2003, the court certified a
class that included all travel agencies who have been or will be required to pay money to American
for debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995 to the present. The plaintiffs sought
to enjoin American from enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for
debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 24, 2005, the court
decertified the class. The claims against Airlines Reporting Corporation have been dismissed, and
in September 2005, the Court granted Summary Judgment in favor of the Company and all other
defendants. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit. Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit, a final adverse court
decision could impose restrictions on the Company’s relationships with travel agencies, which could
have a material adverse impact on the Company.

Between April 3, 2003 and June 5, 2003, three lawsuits were filed by travel agents some of whom
opted out of a prior class action (now dismissed) to pursue their claims individually against
American, other airline defendants, and in one case against certain airline defendants and Orbitz
LLC. (

Tam Travel et. al., v. Delta Air Lines et. al

., in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California – San Francisco (51 individual agencies),

Paula Fausky
d/b/a Timeless Travel v. American Airlines, et. al,

in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Ohio Eastern Division (29 agencies) and

Swope Travel et al. v. Orbitz et.
al

. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division (6
agencies)). Collectively, these lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief alleging that the
certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC: (i) conspired to prevent travel agents from acting as
effective competitors in the distribution of airline tickets to passengers in violation of Section
1 of the Sherman Act; (ii) conspired to monopolize the distribution of common carrier air travel
between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; and that (iii)
between 1995 and the present, the airline defendants conspired to reduce commissions paid to
U.S.-based travel agents in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. These cases have been
consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern
Division. American is vigorously defending these lawsuits. A final adverse court decision awarding
substantial money damages or placing restrictions on the Company’s distribution practices would
have a material adverse impact on the Company.

On August 19, 2002, a class action lawsuit seeking monetary damages was filed, and on May 7, 2003,
an amended complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (

Power Travel International, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., et al.

) against
American, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Northwest Airlines, alleging
that American and the other defendants breached their contracts with the agency and were unjustly
enriched when these carriers at various times reduced their base commissions to zero. The as yet
uncertified class includes all travel agencies accredited by the Airlines Reporting Corporation
“whose base commissions on airline tickets were unilaterally reduced to zero by” the defendants.
The claims against Delta Air Lines have been dismissed, and the case is stayed as to United
Airlines and Northwest Airlines since they filed for bankruptcy. American is vigorously defending
the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit, a final adverse
court decision awarding substantial money damages or forcing the Company to pay agency commissions
would have an adverse impact on the Company.



Miami-Dade County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating various environmental
conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs through
landing fees and various cost recovery methods. American and AMR Eagle have been named as
potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination at MIA. During the second quarter of
2001, the County filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including American, in an attempt to
recover its past and future cleanup costs (

Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo
Services, Inc., et al.

in the Florida Circuit Court). The Company is vigorously defending the
lawsuit. In addition to the 17 defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies
were also named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination. The case is currently stayed while
the parties pursue an alternative dispute resolution process. The County has proposed draft
allocation models for remedial costs for the Terminal and Tank Farm areas of MIA. While it is
anticipated that American and AMR Eagle will be allocated equitable shares of remedial costs, the
Company does not expect the allocated amounts to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Four cases (each being a purported class action) have been filed against American arising from the
disclosure of passenger name records by a vendor of American. The cases are:

Kimmell v. AMR,
et al.

(U. S. District Court, Texas),

Baldwin v. AMR, et al.

(U. S. District Court,
Texas),

Rosenberg v. AMR, et al.

(U. S. District Court, New York) and

Anapolsky v. AMR,
et al

. (U.S. District Court, New York). The

Kimmell

suit was filed in April 2004. The

Baldwin

and

Rosenberg

cases were filed in May 2004. The

Anapolsky

suit was
filed in September 2004. The suits allege various causes of action, including but not limited to,
violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, negligent misrepresentation, breach of
contract and violation of alleged common law rights of privacy. In each case plaintiffs seek
statutory damages of $1000 per passenger, plus additional unspecified monetary damages. The Court
dismissed the cases but allowed leave to amend, and the plaintiffs in the

Kimmell

and

Rosenberg

cases filed amended complaints on June 24, 2005. The Company is vigorously
defending these suits and believes the suits are without merit. However, a final adverse court
decision awarding substantial money damages would have a material adverse impact on the Company.

American is defending two lawsuits, filed as class actions but not certified as such, arising from
allegedly improper failure to refund certain governmental taxes and fees collected by the Company
upon the sale of nonrefundable tickets when such tickets are not used for travel. In

Harrington v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., et al.

, (filed November 24, 2004 in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts), the plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages
(trebled), declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys’ fees. The suits assert
various causes of action, including breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment against
American and numerous other airline defendants. Additionally, the same attorneys representing the
Harrington plaintiffs have filed a qui tam suit entitled

Teitelbaum v. Alaska Airlines, et
al.

American was notified it is a defendant in this case in December 2005. This case, also
pending in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserts essentially
the same claims (but also asserts that the United States has been damaged) and requests essentially
the same relief on behalf of the United States. The Company is vigorously defending the suits and
believes them to be without merit. However, a final adverse court decision requiring the Company
to refund collected taxes and/or fees could have a material adverse impact on the Company.

On March 11, 2004, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against AMR, American, AMR Eagle Holding
Corporation, and American Eagle in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas (

IAP Intermodal, L.L.C. v. AMR Corp., et al.

). The case was consolidated with eight
similar lawsuits filed against a number of other unaffiliated airlines, including Continental,
Northwest, British Airways, Air France, Pinnacle Airlines, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines (as
well as various regional affiliates of the foregoing). The plaintiff alleges that the airline
defendants infringe three patents, each of which relates to a system of scheduling vehicles based
on freight and passenger transportation requests received from remote computer terminals. The
plaintiff is seeking past and future royalties of over $30 billion dollars, injunctive relief,
costs and attorneys’ fees. On September 7, 2005, the court issued a memorandum opinion that
interpreted disputed terms in the patents. The plaintiff dismissed its claims without prejudice to
its right to appeal the September 7, 2005 opinion, and the plaintiff is pursuing such an appeal.
Although the Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit and is vigorously
defending the lawsuit, a final adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing
material restrictions on existing scheduling practices would have a material adverse impact on the
Company.



On July 12, 2004, a consolidated class action complaint, that was subsequently amended on November
30, 2004, was filed against American and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA),
the Union which represents the Company’s flight attendants (

Ann M. Marcoux, et al., v. American
Airlines Inc., et al.

in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York). While a class has not yet been certified, the lawsuit seeks on behalf of all of American’s
flight attendants or various subclasses to set aside, and to obtain damages allegedly resulting
from, the April 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement referred to as the Restructuring Participation
Agreement (RPA). The RPA was one of three labor agreements the Company successfully reached with
its unions in order to avoid filing for bankruptcy in 2003. In a related case

(Sherry Cooper,
et al. v. TWA Airlines, LLC, et al.

, also in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York), the court denied a preliminary injunction against implementation of the RPA
on June 30, 2003. The Marcoux suit alleges various claims against the Union and American relating
to the RPA and the ratification vote on the RPA by individual Union members, including: violation
of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and the APFA’s Constitution and
By-laws, violation by the Union of its duty of fair representation to its members, violation by the
Company of provisions of the Railway Labor Act through improper coercion of flight attendants into
voting or changing their vote for ratification, and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). Although the Company believes the case against it is
without merit and both the Company and the Union are vigorously defending the lawsuit, a final
adverse court decision invalidating the RPA and awarding substantial money damages would have a
material adverse impact on the Company.

On February 14, 2006, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”)
served the Company with a grand jury subpoena as part of an ongoing investigation into possible
criminal violations of the antitrust laws by certain domestic and foreign air cargo carriers. At
this time, the Company does not believe it is a target of the DOJ investigation. On February 22,
2006, the Company received a letter from the Swiss Competition Commission (the “Commission”)
informing the Company that the Commission is investigating whether the Company and certain other
cargo carriers entered into agreements relating to fuel surcharges, security surcharges, war risk
surcharges, and customs clearance surcharges. The Company intends to cooperate fully with these
investigations. In the event that these investigations uncover violations of the U.S. antitrust
laws or the competition laws of some other jurisdiction, such findings and related legal
proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the Company.

Two purported class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company and certain foreign and
domestic air carriers alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. antitrust laws by illegally
conspiring to set prices and surcharges on cargo shipments (

Animal Land, Inc. v. Air Canada et
al.

, filed February 17, 2006, and

Adams v. British Airways, et al

, filed February 22,
2006, both of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York). Plaintiffs are seeking trebled money damages and injunctive relief. American will
vigorously defend these lawsuits; however, any adverse judgment could have a material adverse
impact on the Company.

assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. Accordingly, the 2001 financial
information above includes the operating results of TWA LLC since the date of acquisition.


For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension
liability adjustment resulting in an after tax charge to stockholders’ equity (deficit) of
approximately $1.0 billion. The Company recorded a reduction to the additional minimum pension
liability resulting in a credit to stockholders’ equity (deficit) of approximately $337
million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $129 million for the year ended December 31,
2004. The Company recorded an additional charge resulting in a debit to stockholders’ equity
(deficit) of $379 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

No cash dividends were declared on AMR’s common shares during any of the periods above.

Information on the comparability of results is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking Information

The discussions under Business, Risk Factors, Properties and Legal Proceedings and the following
discussions under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk contain various
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent the
Company’s expectations or beliefs concerning future events. When used in this document and in
documents incorporated herein by reference, the words “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,”
“indicates,” “believes,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
include, without limitation, the Company’s expectations concerning operations and financial
conditions, including changes in capacity, revenues, and costs, future financing plans and needs,
overall economic conditions, plans and objectives for future operations, and the impact on the
Company of its results of operations in recent years and the sufficiency of its financial resources
to absorb that impact. Other forward-looking statements include statements which do not relate
solely to historical facts, such as, without limitation, statements which discuss the possible
future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects
of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking
statements in this report are based upon information available to the Company on the date of this
report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The Risk Factors
listed in Item 1A, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could cause the Company’s
actual results to differ materially from historical results and from those expressed in
forward-looking statements.

Overview

The Company has incurred very large operating and net losses during the past five years, as shown
in the following table:

Year ended December 31,

(in millions)

)

These losses reflect, among other things, a substantial decrease in the Company’s revenues in 2001
and 2002. This revenue decrease was primarily driven by (i) a steep fall-off in the demand for air
travel, particularly business travel, primarily caused by weakness in the U.S. economy, (ii)
reduced pricing power, resulting mainly from greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers
(especially business travelers), increasing competition from LCCs, and the use of the Internet and
(iii) the aftermath of the Terrorist Attacks, which accelerated and exacerbated the trend of
decreased demand and reduced industry revenues. Subsequent to 2002, passenger traffic significantly
improved, reflecting a general economic improvement. In 2005, mainline passenger load factor
increased 3.8 points year-over-year to 78.6 percent. In addition, mainline passenger revenue yield
began rebounding in 2005 and increased 4.0 percent year-over-year. However, passenger revenue
yield remains depressed by historical standards. The Company believes this depressed passenger
yield is the result of its reduced pricing power resulting from the factors listed in clause (ii)
above, and other factors, which the Company believes will persist indefinitely and possibly
permanently.



The Company’s 2004 and 2005 financial results were also adversely affected by significant increases
in the price of jet fuel. The average price per gallon of fuel increased 33.9 cents from 2003 to
2004 and 51.9 cents from 2004 to 2005. These price increases negatively impacted fuel expense by
$1.1 billion and $1.7 billion in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Continuing high fuel prices,
additional increases in the price of fuel, and/or disruptions in the supply of fuel, would further
adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and its results of operations.

In response to the challenges faced by the Company, during the past five years the Company has
implemented several restructuring and other initiatives:



These initiatives have significantly improved the Company’s cost structure and resulted in the
Company achieving what the Company believes to be the lowest unit costs of the traditional carriers
in 2004. However, a significant number of the Company’s competitors have recently reorganized or
are reorganizing, including under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, including
Delta, United, US Airways and Northwest. These competitors are significantly reducing their cost
structures through bankruptcy, resulting in the Company’s cost structure once again becoming less
competitive.

The Company’s ability to become profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on
an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely beyond the Company’s
control. Some of the risk factors that affect the Company’s business and financial results are
discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A. As the Company seeks to improve its financial
condition, it must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce
its costs. Although the Company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and
revenue challenges, the ultimate success of these initiatives is not known at this time and cannot
be assured. It will be very difficult, absent continued restructuring of its operations, for the
Company to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, or to become profitable, if the
overall industry revenue environment does not continue to improve and fuel prices remain at
historically high levels for an extended period.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Assets

At December 31, 2005, the Company had $3.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments
and $510 million in restricted cash and short-term investments.

Significant Indebtedness and Future Financing

Substantial indebtedness is a significant risk to the Company as discussed in the Risk Factors
listed in Item 1A. During 2003, 2004 and 2005, in addition to refinancing its Credit Facility and
certain debt with an institutional investor (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements),
the Company raised an aggregate of approximately $4.5 billion of financing to fund capital
commitments (mainly for aircraft and ground properties) and operating losses and to bolster its
liquidity. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company believes that it should have sufficient
liquidity to fund its operations for the foreseeable future, including repayment of debt and
capital leases, capital expenditures and other contractual obligations. However, to maintain
sufficient liquidity as the Company continues to implement its restructuring and cost reduction
initiatives, and because the Company has significant debt, lease and other obligations in the next
several years, as well as substantial pension funding obligations (refer to Contractual Obligations
in this Item 7), the Company will need access to additional funding. The Company’s possible
financing sources primarily include: (i) a limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt (a
very large majority of the Company’s owned aircraft, including virtually all of the Company’s
Section 1110-eligible aircraft, are encumbered) or sale-leaseback transactions involving owned
aircraft, (ii) debt secured by new aircraft deliveries, (iii) debt secured by other assets, (iv)
securitization of future operating receipts, (v) the sale or monetization of certain assets, (vi)
unsecured debt and (vii) equity and/or equity-like securities. However, the availability and level
of these financing sources cannot be assured, particularly in light of the Company’s and American’s
recent financial results, substantial indebtedness, reduced credit ratings, high fuel prices,
historically weak revenues and the financial difficulties being experienced in the airline
industry. The inability of the Company to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms would have
a material adverse impact on the ability of the Company to sustain its operations over the
long-term.

Credit Ratings

AMR’s and American’s credit ratings are significantly below investment grade. Additional reductions
in AMR’s or American’s credit ratings could further increase its borrowing or other costs and
further restrict the availability of future financing.

Credit Facility Covenants

American has a credit facility consisting of a fully drawn $540 million senior secured revolving
credit facility, with a final maturity on June 17, 2009, and a fully drawn $248 million term loan
facility, with a final maturity on December 17, 2010 (the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan
Facility, respectively, and collectively, the Credit Facility). American’s obligations under the
Credit Facility are guaranteed by AMR.



The Credit Facility contains a covenant (the Liquidity Covenant) requiring American to maintain, as
defined, unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term investments and amounts available for drawing
under committed revolving credit facilities of not less than $1.25 billion for each quarterly
period through the remaining life of the credit facility. American was in compliance with the
Liquidity Covenant as of December 31, 2005 and expects to be able to continue to comply with this
covenant. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a covenant (the EBITDAR Covenant) requiring
AMR to maintain a ratio of cash flow (defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense
(less capitalized interest), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals, adjusted for
certain gains or losses and non-cash items) to fixed charges (comprising interest expense (less
capitalized interest) and rentals). AMR was in compliance with the EBITDAR covenant as of December
31, 2005 and expects to be able to continue to comply with this covenant for the period ending
March 31, 2006. However, given the historically high price of fuel and the volatility of fuel
prices and revenues, it is difficult to assess whether AMR and American will, in fact, be able to
continue to comply with the Liquidity Covenant and, in particular, the EBITDAR Covenant, and there
are no assurances that AMR and American will be able to comply with these covenants. Failure to
comply with these covenants would result in a default under the
Credit Facility which - - if the
Company did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise
mitigate, the default - - could
result in a default under a significant amount of the Company’s other debt and lease obligations
and otherwise adversely affect the Company. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements
for the required ratios at each measurement date through the life of the Credit Facility.

Cash Flow Activity

The Company, or its subsidiaries, recorded the following debt (1) during the year ended December
31, 2005 (in millions):

JFK Facilities Sublease Revenue Bonds, net (2)

$


Sale and leaseback of spare engines


Re-marketing of DFW-FIC Revenue Refunding Bonds,
Series 2000A, maturing 2029


Various debt agreements related to the purchase
of regional jet aircraft, net


$

1,141

(1)

The table does not include a transaction in which American purchased certain
obligations due October 2006 with a face value of $261 million at par value from an
institutional investor. In conjunction with the purchase, American borrowed an
additional $245 million under an existing mortgage agreement with a final maturity in
December 2012 from the same investor.

(2)

Amount shown is net of $207 million the Company will receive to fund future
capital spending at JFK, $77 million held by a trustee for future debt service on the
bonds and a discount of $25 million.

See Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the
debt issuances listed above.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company issued and sold 13 million shares of its common
stock. The Company realized $223 million from the equity sale.



The Company’s cash flow from operating activities improved in 2005. Net cash provided by operating
activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $307 million
over 2004, due primarily to an improved revenue environment.

Capital expenditures during 2005 were $681 million and primarily included the acquisition of 20
Embraer 145 aircraft and the cost of improvements at JFK. A portion of the improvements at JFK
were reimbursed to the Company through a financing transaction discussed further above and in Note
6 to the consolidated financial statements.

During 2004, the Company sold its remaining interest in Orbitz, resulting in total proceeds of $185
million and a gain of $146 million.

Working Capital

AMR (principally American) historically operates with a working capital deficit, as do most other
airline companies. In addition, the Company has historically relied heavily on external financing
to fund capital expenditures. More recently, the Company has also relied on external financing to
fund operating losses.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

American has determined that it holds a significant variable interest in, but is not the primary
beneficiary of, certain trusts that are the lessors under 84 of its aircraft operating leases.
These leases contain a fixed price purchase option, which allows American to purchase the aircraft
at a predetermined price on a specified date. However, American does not guarantee the residual
value of the aircraft. As of December 31, 2005, future lease payments required under these leases
totaled $2.6 billion.

Certain special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to
purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased by American and accounted for as
operating leases. Approximately $1.9 billion of these bonds (with total future payments of
approximately $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2005) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both.
Approximately $523 million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender
provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the
bonds at various times: $28 million in 2006, $100 million in 2007, $218 million in 2008, $112
million in 2014 and $65 million in 2015. Although American has the right to remarket the bonds,
there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem
or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling accruals or
be considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments.
Approximately $198 million of special facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions were
successfully remarketed in 2005. They were acquired by American in 2003 under a mandatory tender
provision. Thus, the receipt by American of the proceeds from the remarketing in July 2005
resulted in an increase to Other liabilities and deferred credits where the tendered bonds had been
classified pending their use to offset certain future operating lease obligations.

In addition, the Company has other operating leases, primarily for aircraft and airport facilities,
with total future lease payments of $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2005. Entering into aircraft
leases allows the Company to obtain aircraft without immediate cash outflows.

Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities
- - which are supported by operating leases executed by American — are
guaranteed by AMR and/or American. The special facility revenue bonds with
mandatory tender provisions discussed above are included in this table
under their ultimate maturity date rather than their mandatory tender
provision date. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.


As of December 31, 2005, the Company had commitments to acquire
two Boeing 777-200ERs in 2006; and an aggregate of 47 Boeing 737-800s and
seven Boeing 777-200ERs in 2013 through 2016. The Company has pre-arranged
backstop financing available for the aircraft scheduled to be delivered in
2006.


The table reflects minimum required payments under capacity
purchase contracts between American and two regional airlines, Chautauqua
Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines Inc. If the Company
terminates its contract with Chautauqua without cause, Chautauqua has the
right to put its 15 Embraer aircraft to the Company. If this were to
happen, the Company would take possession of the aircraft and become liable
for lease obligations totaling approximately $21 million per year with
lease expirations in 2018 and 2019. These lease obligations are not
included in the table above. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.


Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest.
Interest on variable rate debt was estimated based on the current rate at
December 31, 2005.




Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily
construction related costs at JFK and information technology related
support. Substantially all of our construction costs at JFK will be
reimbursed through a fund established from a previous financing
transaction. The Company has made estimates as to the timing of certain
payments primarily for construction related costs. The actual timing of
payments may vary from these estimates. Substantially all of the Company’s
purchase orders issued for other purchases in the ordinary course of
business contain a 30-day cancellation clause that allows the Company to
cancel an order with 30 days notice.


Includes expected other postretirement benefit payments through
2015.


Excludes a $2.3 billion accident liability, related to the
Terrorist Attacks and flight 587, recorded in Other liabilities and
deferred credits, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements. This liability is offset in its entirety by a receivable,
recorded in Other assets, which the Company expects to receive from
insurance carriers as claims are resolved.

Pension Obligations

In addition to the commitments summarized above, the Company is required to
make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company’s estimated 2006 contributions to
its defined benefit pension plans are approximately $250 million. This estimate reflects the
provisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004. (The effect of the Pension Funding Equity Act
was to defer to later years a portion of the minimum required contributions that would otherwise
have been due for the 2004 and 2005 plan years.)

Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Company’s defined benefit plans are underfunded
as of December 31, 2005 by $3.2 billion based on the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) and by $2.3
billion based on the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) (refer to Note 10 to the consolidated
financial statements). The Company’s funded status at December 31, 2005 under the relevant ERISA
funding standard is similar to its funded status using the ABO methodology. Due to uncertainties
regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to its
defined benefit pension plans, such as interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset
returns, and, in particular, the impact of proposed legislation currently pending the
reconciliation process of the U.S. Congress, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate its
future required contributions beyond 2006. However, absent significant legislative relief or
significant favorable changes in market conditions, or both, the Company could be required to fund
in 2007 a majority of the underfunded balance under the relevant ERISA funding standard. Even with
significant legislative relief (including proposed airline-specific relief), the Company’s 2007
required minimum contributions are expected to be higher than the Company’s 2006 contributions.

Results of Operations

The Company incurred an $861 million net loss in 2005 compared to a net loss of $761 million in
2004. The Company’s 2005 results were impacted by the continuing increase in fuel prices and
certain other costs, offset by an improvement in revenues, a $108 million decrease in depreciation
expense related to a change in the depreciable lives of certain aircraft types described in Note 1
to the consolidated financial statements, and productivity improvements and other cost reductions
resulting from progress under the Turnaround Plan. The Company’s 2005 results were also impacted
by a $155 million aircraft charge, a $73 million facility charge, an $80 million charge for the
termination of a contract, a $37 million gain related to the resolution of a debt restructuring and
a $22 million credit for the reversal of an insurance reserve. All of these amounts are included
in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, except for a portion of
the facility charge which is included in Other rentals and landing fees. Also included in the 2005
results was a $69 million fuel tax credit. Of this amount, $55 million is included in Aircraft
fuel expense and $14 million is included in Interest income in the consolidated statement of
operations. The Company’s 2004 results include a $146 million gain on the sale of the Company’s
remaining investment in Orbitz that is included in Miscellaneous, net in the consolidated statement
of operations and net restructuring charges of $11 million included in Other operating expenses in
the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the Company did not record a tax benefit
associated with its 2005 or 2004 losses.



Revenues

2005 Compared to 2004

The Company’s revenues increased approximately $2.1 billion, or 11.1
percent, to $20.7 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. American’s passenger revenues increased by 10.6
percent, or $1.6 billion, on a capacity (available seat mile) (ASM) increase of 1.2 percent.
American’s passenger load factor increased 3.8 points to 78.6 percent and passenger revenue yield
per passenger mile increased 4.0 percent to 12.01 cents. This resulted in an increase in passenger
revenue per available seat mile (RASM) of 9.3 percent to 9.43 cents. In 2005, American derived
approximately 65 percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 35
percent from international operations. Following is additional information regarding American’s
domestic and international RASM and capacity:

The Company’s Regional Affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines,
Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, AMR Eagle), and two independent carriers with
which American has capacity purchase agreements, Trans States Airlines, Inc. (Trans States) and
Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua).

Regional Affiliates’ passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard proration agreements
for flights connecting to American flights, increased $272 million, or 14.5 percent, to $2.1
billion as a result of increased capacity and load factors. Regional Affiliates’ traffic increased
22.8 percent to 8.9 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs), while capacity increased 17.3 percent
to 12.7 billion ASMs, resulting in a 3.2 point increase in passenger load factor to 70.4 percent.

Cargo revenues decreased 0.5 percent, or $3 million, primarily due to a 0.5 percent decrease in
cargo revenue yield per ton mile. However, the cargo division saw a $49 million increase in fuel
surcharges and other service fees. These amounts are included in Other revenues which are
discussed below.

Other revenues increased 18.3 percent, or $205 million, to $1.3 billion due in part to increased
cargo fuel surcharges, increased third-party maintenance contracts obtained by the Company’s
maintenance and engineering group and increases in certain passenger fees.



2004 Compared to 2003

The Company’s revenues increased approximately $1.2 billion, or 6.9
percent, to $18.6 billion in 2004 compared to 2003. American’s passenger revenues increased by 4.8
percent, or $689 million, on a capacity (available seat mile) (ASM) increase of 5.3 percent.
American’s passenger load factor increased 2.0 points to 74.8 percent while passenger revenue yield
per passenger mile decreased by 3.1 percent to 11.54 cents. This resulted in a decrease in
passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) of 0.5 percent to 8.63 cents. In 2004, American
derived approximately 66 percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and
approximately 34 percent from international operations. Following is additional information

Regional Affiliates’ passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard proration agreements
for flights connecting to American flights, increased $357 million, or 23.5 percent, to $1.9
billion as a result of increased capacity and load factors. Regional Affiliates’ traffic increased
32.0 percent to 7.3 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs), while capacity increased 26.0 percent
to 10.8 billion ASMs, resulting in a 3.0 point increase in passenger load factor to 67.2 percent.

Cargo revenues increased 12.0 percent, or $67 million, primarily due to a 10.2 percent increase in
cargo ton miles.



Operating Expenses

2005 Compared to 2004

The Company’s total operating expenses increased 10.7 percent, or $2.0
billion, to $20.8 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. American’s mainline operating expenses per ASM
in 2005 increased 7.9 percent compared to 2004 to 10.50 cents. This increase in operating expenses
per ASM is due primarily to a 42.1 percent increase in American’s price per gallon of fuel (net of
the impact of a fuel tax credit and fuel hedging) in 2005 relative to 2004.

(a)

Aircraft fuel expense increased primarily due to a 42.1 percent increase in
American’s price per gallon of fuel (including the benefit of a $55 million fuel excise
tax refund received in March 2005 and the impact of fuel hedging) offset by a 2.2
percent decrease in American’s fuel consumption.

(b)

Effective January 1, 2005, in order to more accurately reflect the expected useful
lives of its aircraft, the Company changed its estimate of the depreciable lives of its
Boeing 737-800, Boeing 757-200 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft from 25 to 30
years. As a result of this change, Depreciation and amortization expense was reduced
by approximately $108 million during the year and the per share net loss was $0.65 less
than it otherwise would have been.

(c)

Other operating expenses increased due to a $155 million charge for the retirement
of 27 MD-80 aircraft, facilities charges of $56 million as part of the Company’s
restructuring initiatives and an $80 million charge for the termination of an airport
construction contract. These charges were somewhat offset by a $37 million gain
related to the resolution of a debt restructuring and a $22 million credit for the
reversal of an insurance reserve. The account was also impacted by an increase in
communications charges of $53 million year-over-year due to increased international
flying and higher rates.



2004 Compared to 2003

The Company’s total operating expenses increased 2.8 percent, or $505
million, to $18.8 billion in 2004 compared to 2003. American’s mainline operating expenses per ASM
in 2004 decreased 4.1 percent compared to 2003 to 9.73 cents. This decrease in operating expenses
per ASM is due primarily to American’s cost savings initiatives and occurred despite the benefit in
2003 of the receipt of a grant from the U.S. government and a 38.5 percent increase in American’s
price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact of fuel hedging) in 2004 relative to 2003.

%

(a)

Wages, salaries and benefits decreased due to lower wage rates and reduced
headcount primarily as a result of the Labor Agreements and Management Reductions,
discussed in the Company’s 2003 Form 10-K, which became effective in the second quarter
of 2003. This decrease was offset to some degree by increased headcount related to
capacity increases.

(b)

Aircraft fuel expense increased due to a 38.7 percent increase in the Company’s
price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact of fuel hedging) and a 3.3 percent increase
in the Company’s fuel consumption.

(c)

Maintenance, materials and repairs increased primarily due to increased aircraft
utilization, the benefit from retiring aircraft subsiding and increases in contractual
rates in certain flight hour agreements for outsourced aircraft engine maintenance.

(d)

Aircraft rentals decreased primarily due to the removal of leased aircraft from the
fleet in the second half of 2003 as part of the Company’s restructuring initiatives and
concessionary agreements with certain lessors, which reduced future lease payment
amounts and resulted in the conversion of 30 operating leases to capital leases in the
second quarter of 2003.

(e)

Included in this amount are restructuring charges for 2004 which included (i) the
reversal of reserves previously established for aircraft return costs of $20 million,
facility exit costs of $21 million and employee severance of $11 million, (ii) $21
million in aircraft charges and (iii) $42 million in employee charges. Restructuring
charges for 2003 included approximately (i) $341 million in aircraft charges offset by
a $20 million credit to adjust prior accruals, (ii) $92 million in employee charges,
(iii) $62 million in facility exit costs and a (iv) $68 million gain resulting from a
transaction involving 33 of the Company’s Fokker 100 aircraft and related debt.

(f)

U.S. government grant for 2003 reflects the reimbursement of security service fees
from the U.S. government under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act,
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.



Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) consists of interest income and expense, interest capitalized and
miscellaneous — net.

2005 Compared to 2004

Increases in both short-term investment balances and interest rates caused
an increase in Interest income of $83 million, or 125.8 percent, to $149 million. Interest expense
increased $86 million, or 9.9 percent, to $957 million primarily as a result of increases in
interest rates. Miscellaneous-net for 2004 includes a $146 million gain on the sale of the
Company’s remaining interest in Orbitz.

2004 Compared to 2003

Interest income increased $11 million, or 20.0 percent, to $66 million due
primarily to increases in short-term investment balances and interest rates. Interest expense
increased $168 million, or 23.9 percent, to $871 million resulting primarily from the increase in
the Company’s long-term debt coupled with increases in interest rates, and an $84 million reduction
in interest expense in 2003 related to the agreement reached with the IRS discussed below.

Income Tax Benefit

2005 and 2004

The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with its 2005 and 2004 losses
due to the Company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated
financial statements.


The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with its 2003 losses due to the
Company providing a valuation allowance. Additionally, in 2003, the Company reached an agreement
with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995. As a result of this agreement, the Company
recorded an $80 million tax benefit to reduce previously accrued income tax liabilities and an $84
million reduction in interest expense to reduce previously accrued interest related to the accrued
income tax liabilities.

Outlook

The Company currently expects first quarter mainline unit costs to be approximately 10.7 cents.
Capacity for American’s mainline jet operations is expected to be essentially flat in the first
quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005. American’s mainline capacity for the full
year 2006 is expected to decrease by 1.3 percent, with a decrease in domestic capacity of 4.1
percent and an increase in international capacity of 4.0 percent.

Other Information

Environmental Matters

Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potential liability with regard
to several environmental cleanup sites and certain airport locations. At sites where remedial
litigation has commenced, potential liability is joint and several. AMR’s alleged volumetric
contributions at these sites are minimal compared to others. AMR does not expect these matters,
individually or collectively, to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial
position or liquidity. Additional information is included in Item 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. The Company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however,
actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates.
The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used by
management in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements: accounting for long-lived
assets, passenger revenue, frequent flyer program, pensions and other postretirement benefits,
income taxes and tax contingencies.



Long-lived assets –

The Company has approximately $19 billion of long-lived assets as of
December 31, 2005, including approximately $18 billion related to flight equipment and other
fixed assets. In addition to the original cost of these assets, their recorded value is
impacted by a number of policy elections made by the Company, including estimated useful lives
and salvage values. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS 144), the Company
records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and
circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net
book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In making these determinations,
the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value
of the assets; and (ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets,
which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service and
estimated salvage values. A change in the Company’s fleet plan has been the primary indicator
that has resulted in an impairment charge in the past. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the
Company permanently grounded and retired 27 McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airframes, 24 of which had
previously been in temporary storage. See further discussion of the charge related to the
retirement in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Passenger revenue –

Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of Air
traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time service is
provided. However, due to various factors, including the industry’s pricing structure and
interline agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using
estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be
recognized, including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of
historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the
outcome of future events based on the Company’s historical experience, and are recognized at
the time of departure. The Company’s estimation techniques have been applied consistently from
year to year. However, due to changes in the Company’s ticket refund policy and changes in
the travel profile of customers, historical trends may not be representative of future
results.

Frequent flyer program –

American uses the incremental cost method to account for the portion
of its frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by
flying on American or American Eagle. American’s frequent flyer liability is accrued each
time a member accumulates sufficient mileage in his or her account to claim the lowest level
of free travel award (25,000 miles) and the award is expected to be used for free travel.
American includes fuel, food, and reservations/ticketing costs in the calculation of
incremental cost. These estimates are generally updated based upon the Company’s 12-month
historical average of such costs. American also accrues a frequent flyer liability for the
mileage credits that are expected to be used for travel on participating airlines based on
historical usage patterns and contractual rates.

At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, American estimated that approximately ten million free
travel awards were expected to be redeemed for free travel on American and American Eagle. In
making the estimate of free travel awards, American has excluded mileage in inactive accounts,
mileage related to accounts that have not yet reached the lowest level of free travel award,
and mileage in active accounts that have reached the lowest level of free travel award but
which are not expected to ever be redeemed for free travel on American or participating
airlines. The Company’s total liability for future AAdvantage award redemptions for free,
discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or participating airlines as well as
unrecognized revenue from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies was approximately $1.5
billion and $1.4 billion (and is recorded as a component of Air traffic liability in the
consolidated balance sheets), representing 17.7 percent and 19.6 percent of AMR’s total
current liabilities, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company’s discount rate is determined based upon the review of year-end high quality
corporate bond rates. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2005
would increase the Company’s pension and postretirement benefits obligations by approximately
$662 million and $170 million, respectively, and increase estimated 2006 pension and
postretirement benefits expense by $75 million and $9 million, respectively.

The expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of the Company’s historical
trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions and the
Company’s target asset allocation of 40 percent longer duration corporate bonds, 25 percent
U.S. value stocks, 20 percent developed international stocks, five percent emerging markets
stocks and bonds and ten percent alternative (private) investments. The expected return on
plan assets component of the Company’s net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the
fair value of plan assets and the Company’s target asset allocation. The Company monitors its
actual asset allocation and believes that its long-term asset allocation will continue to
approximate its target allocation. The Company’s historical annualized ten-year rate of
return on plan assets, calculated using a geometric compounding of monthly returns, is
approximately 10.6 percent as of December 31, 2005. Lowering the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2005 would increase estimated 2006
pension expense by approximately $38 million.



New Accounting Pronouncement

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS
123(R)). SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. Prior to
SFAS 123(R), companies could elect to account for share-based payments under APB 25 and provide the
pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123 (described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements). SFAS 123(R) is effective January 1, 2006 for AMR. Under SFAS 123(R), compensation
expense will be recognized for the portion of outstanding awards as service is provided, based on
the grant-date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS 123 for pro forma disclosures. The
Company expects that the impact of adoption on its first quarter 2006 results will be similar to
the amounts disclosed in each quarterly period during 2005. However, subsequent to the first
quarter of 2006, the impact of SFAS 123(R) will decrease significantly due to the vesting period
ending for stock options issued under the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan.



ITEM 7(A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions

The risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential
loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects
that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional
actions management may take to mitigate the Company’s exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual
results may differ. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and
additional information.

Aircraft Fuel

The Company’s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of
aircraft fuel. In order to provide a measure of control over price and supply, the Company trades
and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight operations. The Company
also manages the price risk of fuel costs primarily by using jet fuel, heating oil, and crude oil
hedging contracts. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the December
31, 2005 and 2004 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected 2006 fuel usage, such an increase
would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $528 million in 2006,
inclusive of the impact of effective fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2005, and
assumes the Company’s fuel hedging program remains effective under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”.
Comparatively, based on projected 2005 fuel usage, such an increase would have resulted in an
increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $377 million in 2005, inclusive of the impact of
fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2004. The change in market risk is due to the
increase in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had hedged, with option contracts,
including collars, approximately 17 percent of its estimated 2006 fuel requirements and an
insignificant amount of its estimated fuel requirements thereafter. The consumption hedged for
2006 is capped at an average price of approximately $60 per barrel of crude oil. Comparatively, as
of December 31, 2004 the Company had hedged, with option contracts, approximately five percent of
its estimated 2005 fuel requirements. A deterioration of the Company’s financial position could
negatively affect the Company’s ability to hedge fuel in the future.

Foreign Currency

The Company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. The
Company’s largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and
various Latin American currencies. The Company does not currently have a foreign currency hedge
program related to its foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. The result of a uniform 10
percent strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2005 and 2004 levels
relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign currency exposure would result
in a decrease in operating income of approximately $105 million and $93 million for the years
ending December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, due to the Company’s foreign-denominated revenues
exceeding its foreign-denominated expenses. This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon
projected 2006 and 2005 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Interest

The Company’s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact
those changes have on its interest income from cash and short-term investments, and its interest
expense from variable-rate debt instruments. The Company’s largest exposure with respect to
variable-rate debt comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company had
variable-rate debt instruments representing approximately 32 percent and 34 percent of its total
long-term debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. If the Company’s interest rates
average 10 percent more in 2006 than they did at December 31, 2005, the Company’s interest expense
would increase by approximately $28 million and interest income from cash and short-term
investments would increase by approximately $18 million. In comparison, at December 31, 2004, the
Company estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in 2005 than they did at December
31, 2004, the Company’s interest expense would have increased by approximately $21 million and
interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased by approximately $7
million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates
on the Company’s variable-rate long-term debt and cash and short-term investment balances at
December 31, 2005 and 2004.



Market risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value
resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates, and amounts to approximately
$409 million and $418 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair values of
the Company’s long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash
flows based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements.

Other

The Company holds investments in certain other entities which are subject to market risk.
However, the impact of such market risk on earnings is not significant due to the immateriality of
the carrying value and the geographically diverse nature of these holdings.

AMR Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMR Corporation as of December 31,
2005 and 2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit)
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of AMR Corporation at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of AMR Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 22, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005
and for the three years ended December 31, 2005 include the accounts of AMR Corporation (AMR or the
Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including (i) its principal subsidiary American
Airlines, Inc. (American) and (ii) its regional airline subsidiary, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation
and its primary subsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines, Inc., Executive Airlines, Inc. and AMR
Leasing Corporation (collectively, AMR Eagle). The consolidated financial statements as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2005 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary
beneficiary. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Reclassifications

Certain charges of $11 million and $407 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively,
resulting from the Terrorist Attacks and our related restructuring activities were previously
recorded in Special charges in the consolidated statement of operations. These amounts have been
included in Other operating expenses.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments

The Company has restricted cash and short-term
investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers’ compensation
obligations.

Inventories

Spare parts, materials and supplies relating to flight equipment are carried at
average acquisition cost and are expensed when used in operations. Allowances for obsolescence are
provided — over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines — for spare parts
expected to be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from service. Allowances are also provided
for spare parts currently identified as excess and obsolete. These allowances are based on
management estimates, which are subject to change.

Maintenance and Repair Costs

Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment
are charged to operating expense as incurred, except costs incurred for maintenance and repair
under flight hour maintenance contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms
when an obligation exists.

Intangible Assets

Route acquisition costs and airport operating and gate lease rights represent
the purchase price attributable to route authorities (including international airport take-off and
landing slots), domestic airport take-off and landing slots and airport gate leasehold rights
acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets (route acquisition costs) are tested for impairment
annually on December 31, rather than amortized, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142). Airport operating
and gate lease rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years to a zero residual
value.

Statements of Cash Flows

Short-term investments, without regard to remaining maturity at
acquisition, are not considered as cash equivalents for purposes of the statements of cash flows.

Measurement of Asset Impairments

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS 144), the Company
records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances
indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by
those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets
exceeds their estimated fair value. In making these determinations, the Company uses certain
assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii)
estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional
assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used in the Company’s
operations and estimated salvage values.



1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)

Equipment and Property

The provision for depreciation of operating equipment and property is
computed on the straight-line method applied to each unit of property, except that major rotable
parts, avionics and assemblies are depreciated on a group basis. The depreciable lives used for
the principal depreciable asset classifications are:

Depreciable Life

American jet aircraft and engines

20 — 30 years

Other regional aircraft and engines

16 — 20 years

Major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies

Life of equipment to which applicable

Improvements to leased flight equipment

Term of lease

Buildings and improvements (principally on
leased land)

5 — 30 years or term of lease,
including estimated renewal options
when renewal is economically
compelled at key airports

Furniture, fixtures and other equipment

3 — 10 years

Capitalized software

3 — 10 years

Effective January 1, 2005, in order to more accurately reflect the expected useful life of its
aircraft, the Company changed its estimate of the depreciable lives of its Boeing 737-800, Boeing
757-200 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft from 25 to 30 years. As a result of this change,
Depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately $108 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005. Additionally, the per share net loss for the year was $0.65 less than it
otherwise would have been.

Residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are generally
five to ten percent, except when guaranteed by a third party for a different amount.

Equipment and property under capital leases are amortized over the term of the leases or, in the
case of certain aircraft, over their expected useful lives. Lease terms vary but are generally ten
to 25 years for aircraft and seven to 40 years for other leased equipment and property.

Regional Affiliates

Revenue from ticket sales is generally recognized when service is provided.
Regional Affiliates revenues for flights connecting to American flights are allocated based on
industry standard proration agreements.

Passenger Revenue

Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of Air traffic
liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time service is provided.
However, due to various factors, including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements
throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both
the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized, including
breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical trends, including
the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the
Company’s historical experience, and are recorded at the time of departure.



1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)

Frequent Flyer Program

The estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is accrued
when such award levels are reached. American also accrues a frequent flyer liability for the
mileage credits that are expected to be used for travel on participating airlines based on
historical usage patterns and contractual rates. American sells mileage credits and related
services to companies participating in its frequent flyer program. The portion of the revenue
related to the sale of mileage credits, representing the revenue for air transportation sold, is
valued at current market rates and is deferred and amortized over 28 months, which approximates the
expected period over which the mileage credits are used. The remaining portion of the revenue,
representing the marketing products sold and administrative costs associated with operating the
AAdvantage program, is recognized upon sale as a component of passenger revenues, as the related
services have been provided. The Company’s total liability for future AAdvantage award redemptions
for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or participating airlines as
well as unrecognized revenue from selling AAdvantage miles was approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4
billion (and is recorded as a component of Air traffic liability on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets) at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Tax Contingencies

The Company has reserves for taxes and associated interest that may become
payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Although the Company believes
that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it nevertheless has
established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge
the positions taken by the Company resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The
tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the
Company’s potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of
limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations,
identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision
affecting a particular tax issue.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expense
was $144 million, $146 million and $150 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Stock Options

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25) and
related Interpretations. Under APB 25, no compensation expense is recognized for stock option
grants if the exercise price of the Company’s stock option grants is at or above the fair market
value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company has adopted the pro forma
disclosure features of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure”. As required by SFAS 123,
pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share have been determined as if the Company
had accounted for its employee stock options and awards granted using the fair value method
prescribed by SFAS 123. The fair value for the stock options was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for
2005, 2004 and 2003: risk-free interest rates ranging from 2.93% to 3.97%; dividend yields of 0%;
expected stock volatility of 55%; and expected life of the options ranging from 3.6 years to 4.0
years.



1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)

The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share amounts if the Company

New Accounting Pronouncement

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS
123(R)). SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. SFAS 123(R)
is effective January 1, 2006 for AMR. Under SFAS 123(R), the Company will recognize compensation
expense for the portion of outstanding awards as service is provided, based on the grant-date fair
value of those awards calculated under SFAS 123 for pro forma disclosures. In addition, the Company
will discontinue recognizing compensation expense over the full vesting period for retirement
eligible employees for future stock option grants and will instead recognize the expense
immediately. The Company expects that the impact of adoption on its first quarter 2006 results
will be similar to the amounts disclosed in each quarterly period during 2005. However, subsequent
to the first quarter of 2006, the impact of SFAS 123(R) will decrease significantly due to the
vesting period ending for stock options issued under the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan.



2. Restructuring Charges and U.S. Government Grant

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company permanently grounded and retired 27 McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 airframes, 24 of which had previously been in temporary storage. The other three aircraft
were in-service immediately prior to being retired. Of these 27 aircraft, 13 are owned by the
Company, six are accounted for as capital leases and eight are accounted for as operating leases.
As a result of the retirement, the Company incurred a charge of $155 million, included in Other
operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, to accrue future lease commitments
and write-down the aircraft frames to their fair values. In determining the fair values of these
aircraft, the Company considered outside third party appraisals and recent transactions involving
inventory for the aircraft.

In 2003, the Company reached concessionary agreements with certain lessors. Certain of these
agreements provided that the Company’s obligations under the related debt would revert to the
original terms if certain events occurred prior to December 31, 2005. Because none of these
events occurred prior to that date, the Company recognized a gain of $37 million in the fourth
quarter of 2005 that was related to the resolution of a debt restructuring agreed to as part of
the concessions.

As a result of the Terrorist Attacks, the depressed revenue environment, high fuel prices and the
Company’s restructuring activities, the Company recorded a number of charges. The following table
summarizes the components of these charges and the remaining accruals for future lease payments,
aircraft lease return and other costs, facilities closure costs and employee severance and benefit
costs (in millions):

U.S. government grant

In April 2003, the President signed the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003
(the Appropriations Act), which included provisions authorizing payment of $2.3 billion to
reimburse air carriers for increased security costs in proportion to the amounts each carrier had
paid or collected in passenger security and air carrier security fees to the Transportation
Security Administration (the Security Fee Reimbursement). The Company’s Security Fee Reimbursement
was $358 million (net of payments to independent regional affiliates) and is included in U.S.
government grant in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.



2. Restructuring Charges and U.S. Government Grant (Continued)

Other

On September 22, 2001, President Bush signed into law the Air Transportation Safety and System
Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act). The Stabilization Act provides that, notwithstanding
any other provision of law, liability for all claims, whether compensatory or punitive, arising
from the Terrorist Attacks, against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability coverage
maintained by the air carrier. Based upon estimates provided by the Company’s insurance providers,
the Company recorded a liability of approximately $2.3 billion for claims arising from the
Terrorist Attacks, after considering the liability protections provided for by the Stabilization
Act. The balance, recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet was $1.9 billion at both December 31, 2005 and
2004. The Company has also recorded a liability
of approximately $423 million related to flight 587, which crashed on November 12, 2001. The
Company has recorded a receivable for all of these amounts, which the Company expects to recover
from its insurance carriers as claims are resolved. These insurance receivables and liabilities are
classified as Other assets and Other liabilities and deferred credits, respectively, on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and are based on reserves established by the Company’s
insurance carriers. These estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available
concerning the expected claims.

3. Investments (Continued)

In 2004, the Company sold its remaining interest in Orbitz, a travel planning website, resulting in
total proceeds of $185 million and a gain of $146 million, which is included in Miscellaneous-net
in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

During 2003, the Company sold its interests in Worldspan, a computer reservations company, and
Hotwire, a discount travel website. The Company received $180 million in cash and a $39 million
promissory note for its interest in Worldspan. It received $84 million in cash, $80 million of
which was recognized as a gain, for its interest in Hotwire. In addition, during 2003, the Company
sold a portion of its interest in Orbitz in connection with an Orbitz initial public offering and a
secondary offering, resulting in total proceeds of $65 million, and a gain of $70 million. Excluded
from this gain are certain contingent payments that will be recorded when and if received. The
gains on the sale of the Company’s interests in Hotwire and Orbitz are included in
Miscellaneous-net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had commitments to acquire two Boeing 777-200ERs in 2006 and
an aggregate of 47 Boeing 737-800s and seven Boeing 777-200ERs in 2013 through 2016. Future
payments for all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate
$102 million in 2006 and an aggregate of approximately $2.8 billion in 2011 through 2016. The
Company has pre-arranged backstop financing available for the aircraft scheduled to be delivered in
2006.

American has granted Boeing a security interest in American’s purchase deposits with Boeing. These
purchase deposits totaled $277 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The Company has contracts related to facility construction or improvement projects, primarily at
airport locations. The contractual obligations related to these projects totaled approximately $236
million as of December 31, 2005. The Company expects to make payments of $176 million and $60
million in 2006 and 2007, respectively. See Footnote 6 for information related to financing of JFK
construction costs which are included in these amounts. In addition, the Company has an
information technology support related contract that requires minimum annual payments of $152
million through 2013.

American has capacity purchase agreements with two regional airlines, Chautauqua Airlines, Inc.
(Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines, Inc. (collectively the
American Connection® carriers) to
provide Embraer EMB-140/145 regional jet services to certain markets under the brand “American
Connection”. Under these arrangements, the Company pays the American Connection carriers a fee per
block hour to operate the aircraft. The block hour fees are designed to cover the American
Connection carriers’ fully allocated costs plus a margin. Assumptions for certain costs such as
fuel, landing fees, insurance, and aircraft ownership are trued up to actual values on a pass
through basis. In consideration for these payments, the Company retains all passenger and other
revenues resulting from the operation of the American Connection regional jets. Minimum payments
under the contracts are $90 million in 2006, $64 million in 2007, $65 million in 2008 and $18
million in 2009. In addition, if the Company terminates the Chautauqua contract without cause,
Chautauqua has the right to put its 15 Embraer aircraft to the Company. If this were to happen,
the Company would take possession of the aircraft and become liable for lease obligations totaling
approximately $21 million per year with lease expirations in 2018 and 2019.

The Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general indemnities in the
normal course of business to third parties for various risks. The Company is not able to estimate
the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are
discussed in the following paragraphs.



4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued)

The Company’s loan agreements and other London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based financing
transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate the Company to
reimburse the applicable lender for incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes
(i) any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with, or credit extended
by such lender related to the loan, (ii) any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to the loan
(except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy requirements. In addition, the Company’s
loan agreements, derivative contracts and other financing arrangements typically contain a
withholding tax provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to the applicable
lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other
financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law.

These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable
transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts the Company could be
obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions
generally would trigger an event of default, and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle
the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due.

In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans and derivative
transactions, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the transaction
based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such
a case, the Company may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant
transaction.

In its aircraft financing agreements, the Company generally indemnifies the financing parties,
trustees acting on their behalf and other relevant parties against liabilities (including certain
taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of
the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the negligence of the
indemnified parties.

The Company has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real estate leases where
the Company as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities related to
the Company’s use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities
resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, the Company
provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to the
Company’s use of the leased property.

Under certain contracts with third parties, the Company indemnifies the third party against legal
liability arising out of an action by the third party, or certain other parties. The terms of these
contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. Generally,
the Company has liability insurance protecting the Company for its obligations it has undertaken
under these indemnities.

AMR and American have event risk covenants in approximately $1.8 billion of indebtedness and
operating leases as of December 31, 2005. These covenants permit the holders of such obligations
to receive a higher rate of return (between 100 and 650 basis points above the stated rate) if a
designated event, as defined, should occur and the credit ratings of such obligations are
downgraded below certain levels within a certain period of time. No designated event, as defined,
has occurred as of December 31, 2005.

The Company is subject to environmental issues at various airport and non-airport locations for
which it has accrued $40 million and $62 million, which are included in Accrued liabilities on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Management
believes, after considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these
environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based
on the Company’s current assessments of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or
decrease as these assessments change.

The Company is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its operations. In the opinion
of management, liabilities, if any, arising from these claims and litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows, after consideration of available insurance.



5. Leases

AMR’s subsidiaries lease various types of equipment and property, primarily aircraft and airport
facilities. The future minimum lease payments required under capital leases, together with the
present value of such payments, and future minimum lease payments required under operating leases
that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31,
2005, were (in millions):

As of December 31, 2005, included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and
deferred credits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is approximately $1.4
billion relating to rent expense being recorded in advance of future operating lease
payments.

At December 31, 2005, the Company was operating 213 jet aircraft and 27 turboprop aircraft
under operating leases and 91 jet aircraft and three turboprop aircraft under capital leases. The
aircraft leases can generally be renewed at rates based on fair market value at the end of the
lease term for one to five years. Some aircraft leases have purchase options at or near the end of
the lease term at fair market value, but generally not to exceed a stated percentage of the defined
lessor’s cost of the aircraft or a predetermined fixed amount.

Certain special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to
improve airport facilities and purchase equipment. To the extent these transactions were committed
to prior to May 21, 1998 (the effective date of EITF 97-10, “The Effect of Lessee Involvement in
Asset Construction”) they are accounted for as operating leases under Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation 23, “Leases of Certain Property Owned by a Governmental Unit or
Authority”. Approximately $1.9 billion of these bonds (with total future payments of approximately
$4.8 billion as of December 31, 2005) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both. Approximately $523
million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require
American to make operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the bonds at various times: $28
million in 2006, $100 million in 2007, $218 million in 2008, $112 million in 2014 and $65 million
in 2015. Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that
these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not
remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid facility
rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments. The special facility revenue bonds
that contain mandatory tender provisions are listed in the table above at their ultimate maturity
date rather than their mandatory tender provision date. Approximately $198 million of special
facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions were successfully remarketed in 2005. They
were acquired by American in 2003 under a mandatory tender provision. Thus, the receipt by
American of the proceeds from the remarketing resulted in an increase to Other liabilities and
deferred credits where the tendered bonds had been classified pending their use to offset certain
future operating lease obligations.



5. Leases (Continued)

Rent expense, excluding landing fees, was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

American has determined that it holds a significant variable interest in, but is not the primary
beneficiary of, certain trusts that are the lessors under 84 of its aircraft operating leases.
These leases contain a fixed price purchase option, which allows American to purchase the aircraft
at a predetermined price on a specified date. However, American does not guarantee the residual
value of the aircraft. As of December 31, 2005, future lease payments required under these leases
totaled $2.6 billion.

billion.

In September 2005, American sold and leased back 89 spare engines with a book value of $105 million
to a variable interest entity (VIE). The net proceeds received from third parties were $133
million. American is considered the primary beneficiary of the activities of the VIE as American
has substantially all of the residual value risk associated with the transaction. As such,
American is required to consolidate the VIE in its financial statements. At December 31, 2005, the
book value of the engines was $103 million and was included in Flight equipment on the consolidated
balance sheet. The engines serve as collateral for the VIE’s long-term debt of $133 million at
December 31, 2005, which has also been included in the consolidated balance sheet. The VIE has no
other significant operations.



6. Indebtedness (Continued)

Also in September 2005, American purchased certain debt obligations due October 2006 with a face
value of $261 million at par value from an institutional investor. In conjunction with the
purchase, American borrowed an additional $245 million under an existing mortgage agreement with a
final maturity in December 2012 from the same investor. The interest rate on the mortgage
agreement remains substantially unchanged. The additional borrowings required American to grant a
security interest in certain spare engines and related collateral. The transaction was accounted
for as a modification of the original debt under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 96-19 “Debtor’s
Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments”. As a result of this transaction,
the Company’s 2006 maturities of long-term debt decreased from $1.3 billion to $1.1 billion.

In November 2005, the New York City Industrial Development Agency issued facilities sublease
revenue bonds for John F. Kennedy International Airport to provide reimbursement to American for
certain facility construction and other related costs. The Company has recorded the issuance of
$775 million (net of $25 million discount) as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2005. The bonds bear interest at fixed rates, with an average effective rate of
8.06 percent, and mature over various periods of time, with a final maturity in 2031. Proceeds
from the offering are to be used to reimburse past and future costs associated with the Company’s
terminal construction project at JFK. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had received
approximately $491 million of the proceeds as reimbursements of certain facility construction and
other related costs. The remaining $284 million of bond issuance proceeds are classified as Other
assets on the consolidated balance sheet, of which $207 million are held by the trustee for
reimbursement of construction costs and will be available to the Company in the future, and $77
million are held in a debt service reserve fund.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, AMR Eagle borrowed approximately $319 million, net of
discount, under various debt agreements related to the purchase of regional jet aircraft. These
debt agreements are secured by the related aircraft, have effective interest rates ranging from
5.00 percent to 5.13 percent, are guaranteed by AMR and mature over various periods of time through
2021.

American has a credit facility consisting of a $540 million senior secured revolving credit
facility and a $248 million term loan facility (the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility,
respectively, and collectively, the Credit Facility). Advances under either facility can be
designated, at American’s election, as LIBOR rate advances or base rate advances. Interest accrues
at the LIBOR rate or base rate, as applicable, plus, in either case, the applicable margin. The
applicable margin with respect to the Revolving Facility can range from 3.25 percent to 5.25
percent per annum, in the case of LIBOR advances, and from 2.25 percent to 4.25 percent per annum,
in the case of base rate advances, depending upon the senior secured debt rating of the Credit
Facility. As of December 31, 2005, the Credit Facility was fully drawn and had an interest rate of
8.73 percent. The interest rate is reset at least every six months based on the current LIBOR rate
election.

The Revolving Facility matures on June 17, 2009. Commitments under the Revolving Facility are
reduced on a quarterly basis with $15 million (or 2.5 percent) of the commitments being reduced in
each of the first twelve quarters of the life of the Revolving Facility and the remainder due at
maturity. Principal amounts repaid under the Revolving Facility may be re-borrowed, up to the
then-available aggregate amount of the commitments.



6. Indebtedness (Continued)

The Term Loan Facility matures on December 17, 2010. The Term Loan Facility amortizes on a
quarterly basis over a period of six years, with less than $1 million (or 0.25 percent) of the
principal payable quarterly in each of the first 20 quarters and the remainder due at maturity.
Principal amounts repaid under the Term Loan Facility may not be re-borrowed.

The Credit Facility is secured by certain aircraft. The Credit Facility includes a covenant that
requires periodic appraisal of the aircraft at current market value and requires American to pledge
more aircraft or cash collateral if the loan amount is more than 50 percent of the appraised value
(after giving effect to sublimits for specified categories of aircraft). In addition, the Credit
Facility is secured by all of American’s existing route authorities between the United States and
Tokyo, Japan, together with certain slots, gates and facilities that support the operation of such
routes. American’s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by AMR, and AMR’s guaranty
is secured by a pledge of all the outstanding shares of common stock of American.

The Credit Facility contains a covenant (the Liquidity Covenant) requiring American to maintain, as
defined, unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term investments and amounts available for drawing
under committed revolving credit facilities of not less than $1.25 billion for each quarterly
period through the remaining life of the Credit Facility. American was in compliance with the
Liquidity Covenant as of December 31, 2005 and expects to be able to continue to comply with this
covenant. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a covenant (the EBITDAR Covenant) requiring AMR
to maintain a ratio of cash flow (defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense (less
capitalized interest), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals, adjusted for
certain gains or losses and non-cash items) to fixed charges (comprising interest expense (less
capitalized interest) and rentals) of at least the amount specified below for each period of four
consecutive quarters ending on the dates set forth below:

AMR was in compliance with the EBITDAR Covenant at December 31, 2005 and expects to be able to
comply with this covenant for the period ending March 31, 2006. However, given the historically
high price of fuel and the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, it is difficult to assess
whether AMR and American will, in fact, be able to continue to comply with the Liquidity Covenant
and, in particular, the EBITDAR Covenant, and there are no assurances that AMR and American will be
able to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a
default under the Credit Facility which — - if the Company did not take steps to obtain a waiver
of, or otherwise mitigate, the default — - could result in a default under a significant amount of
the Company’s other debt and lease obligations and otherwise adversely affect the Company.

In 2004, American issued $180 million of Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2009, which bear interest at
7.25 percent. As of December 31, 2005, these notes were secured by certain spare parts and cash
collateral.



6. Indebtedness (Continued)

In 2004, the Company issued $324 million principal amount of its 4.50 percent senior convertible
notes due 2024 (the 4.50 Notes) and in 2003 the Company issued $300 million principal amount of its
4.25 percent senior convertible notes due 2023 (the 4.25 Notes). Each note is convertible into AMR
common stock at a conversion rate of 45.3515 shares for the 4.50 Notes and 57.61 shares for the
4.25 Notes, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an equivalent conversion price
of $22.05 per share for the 4.50 Notes and $17.36 per share for the 4.25 Notes), subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances. The notes are convertible under certain circumstances,
including if (i) the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock reaches a certain level for a
specified period of time, (ii) the trading price of the notes as a percentage of the closing sale
price of the Company’s common stock falls below a certain level for a specified period of time,
(iii) the Company calls the notes for redemption, or (iv) certain corporate transactions occur.
Holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the 4.50 Notes on
February 15, 2009, 2014 and 2019 and 4.25 Notes on September 23, 2008, 2013 and 2018 at a purchase
price equal to the principal amount of the notes being purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of purchase. The Company may pay the purchase price in cash, common stock or a
combination of cash and common stock. After February 15, 2009 and September 23, 2008, the Company
may redeem all or any portion of the 4.50 Notes and 4.25 Notes, respectively, for cash at a price
equal to the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest as of
the redemption date. These notes are guaranteed by American. If the holders of the 4.50 Notes or
the 4.25 Notes require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the notes on the repurchase
dates, it is the Company’s present intention to satisfy the requirement in cash.

Certain debt is secured by aircraft, engines, equipment and other assets having a net book value of
approximately $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2005.

As of December 31, 2005, AMR has issued guarantees covering approximately $1.7 billion of
American’s tax-exempt bond debt and American has issued guarantees covering approximately $1.2
billion of AMR’s unsecured debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, AMR and American have
issued guarantees covering approximately $428 million of AMR Eagle’s secured debt, and AMR has
issued guarantees covering an additional $2.9 billion of AMR Eagle’s secured debt.

Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were $828 million, $729 million and $661
million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.



7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management

As part of the Company’s risk management program, AMR uses a variety of financial instruments,
primarily fuel option and collar contracts. The Company does not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes.

The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these
financial instruments, but it does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet its
obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair
value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date, reduced by the effects of
master netting agreements. To manage credit risks, the Company selects counterparties based on
credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors
the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. The
Company also maintains industry-standard security agreements with a number of its counterparties
which may require the Company or the counterparty to post collateral if the value of selected
instruments exceed specified mark-to-market thresholds or upon certain changes in credit ratings.
The Company’s outstanding posted collateral as of December 31, 2005 is included in restricted cash
and short-term investments and is not material. A deterioration of the Company’s liquidity position
may negatively affect the Company’s ability to hedge fuel in the future.

Fuel Price Risk Management

American enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude oil hedging contracts to dampen the impact of
the volatility in jet fuel prices. These instruments generally have maturities of up to 24 months.
The Company accounts for its fuel derivative contracts as cash flow hedges and records the fair
value of its fuel hedging contracts in Other current assets and Accumulated other comprehensive
loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the ineffective
portion of its fuel hedge contracts by comparing the cumulative change in the total value of the
fuel hedge contract, or group of fuel hedge contracts, to the cumulative change in a hypothetical
jet fuel hedge. If the total cumulative change in value of the fuel hedge contract more than
offsets the total cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel hedge, the difference is considered
ineffective and is immediately recognized as a component of Aircraft fuel expense. Effective gains
or losses on fuel hedging contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are
recognized in earnings as a component of Aircraft fuel expense when the underlying jet fuel being
hedged is used.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or
other crude oil related commodities. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, the Company assesses, both at
the inception of each hedge and on an on-going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items.
In doing so, the Company uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in
prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g. WTI Crude oil and NYMEX Heating oil) to the
change in the price of jet fuel over a 36 month period. The Company also monitors the actual
dollar offset of the hedges’ market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel
hedge contracts are generally deemed to be “highly effective” if the R-squared is greater than 80
percent and the dollar offset correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent. The Company
discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer
expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to discontinue the hedging
relationship. As a result of its quarterly effectiveness assessment on September 30, 2005, the
Company determined that all of its derivatives settling during the remainder of 2005 and certain of
its derivatives settling in 2006 were no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting
changes in forecasted jet fuel purchases. As a result, effective on October 1, 2005, all
subsequent changes in the fair value of those particular hedge contracts have been and will be
recognized directly in earnings rather than being deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Hedge accounting will continue to be applied to derivatives used to hedge forecasted jet fuel
purchases that are expected to remain highly effective.



7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Continued)

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized net gains of
approximately $64 million, $99 million and $149 million, respectively, as a component of fuel
expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to its fuel hedging
agreements. The fair value of the Company’s fuel hedging agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
representing the amount the Company would receive to terminate the agreements, totaled $122 million
and $51 million, respectively.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The Company has entered into Japanese yen currency exchange agreements to hedge certain yen-based
capital lease obligations (effectively converting these obligations into dollar-based obligations).
The Company accounts for its Japanese yen currency exchange agreements as cash flow hedges whereby
the fair value of the related Japanese yen currency exchange agreements is reflected in Other
liabilities and deferred credits and Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The Company has no ineffectiveness with regard to its Japanese yen
currency exchange agreements. The fair values of the Company’s yen currency exchange agreements,
representing the amount the Company would pay to terminate the agreements, were $39 million and $23
million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The exchange rates on the Japanese yen
agreements range from 66.50 to 99.65 yen per U.S. dollar. The actual exchange rate was 117.75 and
102.63 yen per U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices where
available. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair values were estimated using discounted
cash flow analyses, based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
borrowing arrangements. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s long-term
debt, including current maturities, were (in millions):

The change in valuation allowance in 2005, 2004 and 2003 related primarily to net operating loss
carryforwards and resolution of certain tax contingencies.

The recording of other comprehensive income items, primarily the minimum pension liability,
resulted in changes to the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance. The total
increase in the valuation allowance was $506 million, $170 million and $293 million in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not
that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. In assessing the
realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion, or all of the deferred tax assets, will be realized. The ultimate realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (including reversals
of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those temporary differences will become
deductible.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had available for federal income tax purposes an alternative
minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $418 million, which is available for an indefinite
period, and federal net operating losses of approximately $6.6 billion for regular tax purposes,
which will expire, if unused, beginning in 2022. The Company had available for state income tax
purposes net operating losses of $4.2 billion, which expire, if unused, in years 2006 through 2024.
The amount that will expire in 2006 is $162 million.

Cash payments for income taxes were $7 million and $3 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash
refunds for income taxes were $575 million in 2003. The amount received in 2003 relates primarily
to net operating loss carryback claims, including a carryback claim filed as a result of a
provision in Congress’ economic stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of net
operating losses (NOLs). This change allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five
years, rather than two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover
its NOLs.

9. Stock Awards and Options

In March 2003, the Board of Directors of AMR approved the issuance of additional shares of AMR
common stock to employees and certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers in connection with
negotiations concerning concessions. The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance was
approximately 46.9 million shares. From the foregoing authorization, the Company issued
approximately 2.5 million shares to vendors from treasury stock in 2003, resulting in a
re-allocation from Treasury stock to Additional paid-in capital of $142 million. Also in 2003, the
Company established the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the 2003 Plan) to provide equity awards
to employees (from the above shares authorized for issuance) in connection with the Labor
Agreements and Management Reductions. Under the 2003 Plan, employees may be granted stock options,
restricted stock and deferred stock. The total number of shares authorized for distribution under
the 2003 Plan is 42,680,000 shares.



9. Stock Awards and Options (Continued)

Under the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, officers and key employees of AMR and its
subsidiaries may be granted stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock,
deferred stock, stock purchase rights, other stock-based awards and/or performance-related awards,
including cash bonuses. The total number of common shares authorized for distribution under the
1998 Long Term Incentive Plan is 23,700,000 shares. The 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan, the
successor to the 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, will terminate no later than May 21, 2008.

Options granted under the 1988 and 1998 Long Term Incentive Plans (collectively, the LTIP Plans)
and the 2003 Plan are awarded with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on
date of grant, become exercisable in equal annual installments over periods ranging from two to
five years following the date of grant and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
As of December 31, 2005, approximately 8.6 million shares were available for future grant under the
LTIP Plans and the 2003 Plan.

In May 1997, in conjunction with a labor agreement reached between American and members of the
Allied Pilots Association (APA), the Company established the Pilots Stock Option Plan (The Pilot
Plan). The Pilot Plan granted members of the APA the option to purchase 11.5 million shares of AMR
stock at $41.69 per share (after giving effect to the 1998 stock-split), $5 less than the average
fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. These shares were exercisable immediately.
In conjunction with the Sabre spin-off (March 2000), the exercise price was adjusted to $17.59 per
share.

Stock option activity under the LTIP Plans, the Pilot Plan and the 2003 Plan was:

2005.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the total charge for stock-based compensation expense included in wages,
salaries and benefits expense, primarily related to the Company’s performance unit and share plans
(of which there are three active plans at any given point in time), was $132 million, $21 million
and $20 million, respectively. No compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants
under the LTIP Plans or the 2003 Plan, since the exercise price was equal to the fair market value
of the underlying stock on the date of grant.



10. Retirement Benefits

All employees of the Company may participate in pension plans if they meet the plans’ eligibility
requirements. The defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees based on
years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. The
Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its defined benefit plans. American’s pilots
also participate in a defined contribution plan for which Company contributions are determined as a
percentage of participant compensation.

Effective January 1, 2001, American established a defined contribution plan for non-contract
employees in which the Company will match the employees’ before-tax contribution on a
dollar-for-dollar basis, up to 5.5 percent of their pensionable pay. During 2000, American
provided a one-time election for current non-contract employees to remain in the defined benefit
plan or discontinue accruing future credited service in the defined benefit plan as of January 1,
2001 and begin participation in the defined contribution plan. Effective January 1, 2002, all new
non-contract employees of the Company become members of the defined contribution plan.

In addition to pension benefits, other postretirement benefits, including certain health care and
life insurance benefits (which provide secondary coverage to Medicare), are provided to retired
employees. The amount of health care benefits is limited to lifetime maximums as outlined in the
plan. Substantially all regular employees of American and employees of certain other subsidiaries
may become eligible for these benefits if they satisfy eligibility requirements during their
working lives.

Certain employee groups make contributions toward funding a portion of their retiree health care
benefits during their working lives. The Company funds benefits as incurred and makes
contributions to match employee prefunding.

Expected return on plan assets

As of December 31, 2005, the Company changed its estimate of the long-term rate of return on plan
assets to 8.75 percent, based on the target asset allocation. Expected returns on longer duration
bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other
assets are based on a combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets
achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and expected value to be
generated through active management, currency overlay and securities lending programs. The
Company’s annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets as of December 31, 2005, was
approximately 10.6 percent.

The Company’s pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, by asset category,
are as follows:



Long duration bonds


%


%

U.S. stocks



International stocks



Emerging markets stocks and bonds



Alternative (private) investments



Total


%


%

The Company’s target asset allocation is 40 percent longer duration corporate and U.S.
government/agency bonds, 25 percent U.S. value stocks, 20 percent developed international stocks,
five percent emerging markets stocks and bonds, and ten percent alternative (private) investments.
Each asset class is actively managed and the plans’ assets have produced returns, net of management
fees, in excess of the expected rate of return over the last ten years. Stocks and emerging market
bonds are used to provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the
long-term than longer duration U.S. bonds. Public stocks are managed using a value investment
approach in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long-term, while
reducing year-over-year volatility. Longer duration U.S. bonds are used to partially hedge the
assets from declines in interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide
expected returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. Additionally, the Company
engages currency overlay managers in an attempt to increase returns by protecting non-U.S. dollar
denominated assets from a rise in the relative value of the U.S. dollar. The Company also
participates in securities lending programs in order to generate additional income by loaning plan
assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis.

The Company expects to contribute approximately $250 million to its defined benefit pension plans
and $14 million to its postretirement benefit plan in 2006. In addition to making contributions to
its postretirement benefit plan, the Company funds the majority of the benefit payments under this
plan. The Company’s estimate of its defined benefit pension plan contributions reflects the
provisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004. The effect of the Pension Funding Equity Act
was to defer a portion of the minimum required contributions that would have been due for the 2004
and 2005 plan years.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected
to be paid:

11. Intangible Assets

The Company had route acquisition costs (including international slots) of $829 million as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 that are considered indefinite life assets under Financial Accounting
Standard 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The Company’s impairment analysis for route
acquisition costs did not result in an impairment charge in 2005 or 2004.

The following tables provide information relating to the Company’s amortized intangible assets as
of December 31 (in millions):

Airport operating and gate lease rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years
to a zero residual value. The Company recorded amortization expense related to these intangible
assets of approximately $28 million, $29 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company expects to record annual amortization expense of
approximately $28 million in each of the next five years related to these intangible assets.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 78 million, 52 million and 31
million shares issuable upon conversion of the Company’s convertible notes or related to employee
stock options and deferred stock were not added to the denominator because inclusion of such shares
would be antidilutive or because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market
price of the common shares.

14. Segment Reporting

The Company’s operations of American and AMR Eagle are treated as an integrated route network and
the route scheduling system maximizes the operating results of the Company. The Company’s chief
operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions to maximize the Company’s consolidated
financial results. Based on the way the Company treats the network and the manner in which
resource allocation decisions are made, the Company has only one operating segment for financial
reporting purposes consisting of the operations of American and AMR Eagle.

American is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2005, American
provided scheduled jet service to approximately 150 destinations throughout North America, the
Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and Asia. American is also one of the largest scheduled air
freight carriers in the world, providing a full range of freight and mail services to shippers
throughout its system. AMR Eagle owns two regional airlines, which do business as “American Eagle”
- - American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. The American Eagle

®

carriers provide
connecting service from eight of American’s high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the
United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.



14. Segment Reporting (Continued)

Revenues from other segments are below the quantitative threshold for determining reportable
segments and consist primarily of revenues from American Beacon Advisors, Inc. and Americas Ground
Services, Inc. The difference between the financial information of the Company’s one reportable
segment and the financial information included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and balance sheets as a result of these entities is not material.

The Company’s operating revenues by geographic region (as defined by the Department of
Transportation) are summarized below (in millions):

equipment, which are mobile across geographic markets and, therefore, have not been allocated.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. This term refers to the controls and
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. An evaluation
was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness
of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005. Based on that
evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005. During the quarter
ending on December 31, 2005, there was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005 using the criteria set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.

Based on this assessment,
management believes that, as of December 31, 2005, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm who also audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Ernst & Young
LLP’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting appears below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

AMR Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that AMR Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (the COSO criteria). AMR Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that AMR Corporation maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, AMR Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO
criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AMR Corporation as of December 31, 2005
and 2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our report dated
February 22, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
