PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October 1982. AMR's operations fall almost entirely in the airline industry. AMR's principal
subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc., was founded in 1934. On April 9, 2001, American Airlines, Inc. (through a wholly owned subsidiary, TWA Airlines LLC (TWA LLC)) purchased
substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), the eighth largest U.S. carrier. American Airlines, Inc., including TWA LLC
(collectively, American), is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2002, American provided scheduled jet service to more than 152 destinations throughout North America,
the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. American is also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world, providing a wide range of freight and mail services to shippers
throughout its system.

In
addition, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR, owns two regional airlines which do business as "American Eagle"—American Eagle
Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (Executive) (collectively the American Eagle carriers). In addition, American contracts with three independently owned regional airlines which
do business as the "AmericanConnection" (the AmericanConnection carriers). The American Eagle carriers and the AmericanConnection carriers provide connecting service from eight of American's
high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the United States, Canada, the Bahamas and the Caribbean.

AMR
Investment Services, Inc. (AMR Investment), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR, is responsible for the investment and oversight of assets of AMR's defined benefit and defined
contribution plans, as well as its short-term investments. It serves as manager of the American AAdvantage Funds, a family of mutual funds with both institutional and retail shareholders,
and provides customized fixed income portfolio management services. As of December 31, 2002, AMR Investment was responsible for management of approximately $29.6 billion in assets,
including direct management of approximately $17.0 billion in short-term fixed income investments. The Company is actively pursuing a possible sale of AMR Investment.

A. Recent Events

The past two years have had a large impact on the Company's finances. The Company incurred aggregate operating losses of $3.3 billion and
$2.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These losses reflect, among other things, the substantial decrease in the Company's revenues which began in
early 2001. On reduced capacity since the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were down 8.8 percent, with American's revenue
per available seat mile down 7.2 percent on a capacity decrease of 1.4 percent, compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, which included the results of TWA LLC beginning on
April 10, 2001.

Revenues

This
revenue decrease has been driven by a number of factors, some of which the Company believes will persist indefinitely and others permanently, including:

•

A steep fall-off in the demand for air travel, particularly business travel,

primarily caused by
the continuing weakness of the U.S. economy and growing use of travel substitutes such as audio, video, and web conferencing. Because the Company has in recent years tailored its network, product,
schedule and pricing strategies to the business travel market, reduced demand for business travel has affected the Company more than most other carriers. In addition, the war in Iraq has had a
significant adverse impact on international and domestic revenues and future bookings. This adverse impact is expected to continue for the duration of the war and for an unknown period of time
thereafter; however, the Company cannot reasonably predict the extent of such impact.


•

Reduced pricing power,

resulting mainly from greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers, especially
business travelers, and increasing competition from low-cost carriers (LCCs). The percentage of the Company's routes on which it competes with carriers having substantially lower operating
costs has grown significantly over the past decade, and the Company now competes with LCCs on over 80% of its domestic routes. LCCs generally operate with costs per available seat mile that are
substantially lower than the Company's, and pursue a strategy of offering low fares that the Company must match or lose traffic. At the same time, the continuous increase in pricing transparency
resulting from use of the Internet has enabled cost-conscious customers to more easily obtain the lowest fare on any given route. In addition, the Company must now compete with carriers
that are reorganizing under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Historically, air carriers involved in reorganizations have undertaken substantial fare discounting to maintain cash
flows and to enhance customer loyalty. Recent attempts at fare increases by the Company have generally not been successful, and fare sales (including fare sales initiated by carriers in
reorganization) have been significant and widespread.

•

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001

accelerated and exacerbated the trend of decreased demand
and reduced industry revenues. Following September 11, flights to, from and within the United States were not permitted to resume until September 13, 2001 (except for Washington Reagan
Airport, which partially reopened on October 4, 2001). When flights resumed, demand dropped sharply from already reduced levels,
due in part to fears of further attacks and inconvenience to travelers caused by increased government-imposed safety measures.

•

American's international route network

is directed to providing service to the U.K. (including London
Heathrow), Latin America and the Caribbean, where demand has been weak compared to continental Europe and the Pacific. In addition, routes to San Juan, Puerto Rico, which are included in the Company's
domestic results, have been particularly impacted by an increase in industry capacity and competition from new LCC service.

•

Security service fees

imposed by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act increased the cost of travel to
the passenger, thereby dampening the Company's ability to otherwise raise fares.

Costs

In
reaction to this harsh revenue environment, the Company has taken numerous steps to reduce its costs:

•

Following
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in the third quarter of 2001 the Company reduced its operating schedule to approximately
80 percent of the schedule it flew prior to September 11, 2001. In connection with this schedule reduction, the Company eliminated approximately 20,000 jobs. However, beginning in the
fourth quarter of 2001, in response to increasing demand, the Company began increasing its operating schedule from the significantly reduced schedule it flew immediately following the events of
September 11, 2001. The trend towards increasing demand abated in the second quarter of 2002.

•

In
response to the lingering effects of the terrorist attacks and the continuing economic downturn, on August 13, 2002, the Company announced a series
of initiatives to reduce its costs, reduce capacity, simplify its aircraft fleet, and enhance productivity. These initiatives included, among other things, the de-peaking of the Company's
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport hub (following the de-peaking of its Chicago hub), gradually phasing out operation of its Fokker aircraft fleet, and reducing capacity in the fourth
quarter of 2002. In addition, the Company eliminated an additional 7,000 jobs to better align its workforce with the planned capacity reductions, fleet simplification and hub restructuring.

Despite
the Company's on-going efforts to reduce its costs, the Company faces increased costs attributable to factors largely beyond its control, including:

•

Escalating
fuel prices, which show no immediate signs of decreasing, in part due to the war in Iraq and domestic turmoil in Venezuela, Nigeria or other oil
producing regions. American's average cost per gallon of fuel has risen from 66.5 cents in February 2002 to 91.0 cents in February 2003.


•

After
the terrorists attacks of September 11, 2001 and continuing to the present, aviation insurers have significantly reduced the amount of insurance
coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk
coverage). At the same time, the insurance carriers significantly increased the premiums for such limited coverage, as well as for aviation insurance in general. However, the U.S. government has
provided commercial war-risk insurance until June 13, 2003 covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. The Company believes this insurance coverage will be
extended beyond June 13, 2003 because the Homeland Security Act provides for this insurance to remain in place until August 31, 2003. In addition, the Secretary of Transportation may
extend the policy until December 31, 2003, at his discretion.

•

The
Company has borne significantly increased security costs, mainly due to security measures imposed by the U.S. government following the terrorist attacks
of September 11, 2001.

•

On
April 11-12, 2003, the Senate and House agreed to aviation-related assistance provisions in supplemental appropriations legislation to fund the war in
Iraq. The legislation is expected to be signed by President Bush on April 14, 2003. The new law would authorize payment of (i) $100 million to compensate air carriers for the
direct costs associated with the strengthening of flight deck doors and locks and (ii) $2.3 billion to reimburse air carriers for increased security costs which shall be distributed in
proportion to amounts each has paid or collected as of the date of enactment in passenger security and air carrier security fees to the Transportation Security Administration. In addition, the new law
would suspend the collection of the passenger security fee from June 1, 2003 until October 1, 2003, and extend war-risk insurance through September 30, 2004. The Company is not
able to estimate its portion of this compensation at this time.

The
net effect of all of the above factors is that the Company's recent financial results are unsustainable. Given the severity of the Company's financial situation and the Company's
belief that a permanent shift has occurred in the airline revenue environment, the Company continues to review its business model, particularly with a view towards identifying significant cost
reductions. The Company believes that it must quickly reduce its annual operating costs by at least $4 billion in order to become competitive and sustain its operations. The Company has made
progress in identifying more than $2 billion in annual operating cost reductions via initiatives involving: (i) scheduling efficiencies, including de-peaking certain of its
hubs as referred to above, (ii) fleet simplification, (iii) streamlined customer interaction, (iv) distribution modifications, (v) in-flight product changes,
(vi) operational changes and (vii) headquarters/administration efficiencies. Even with these initiatives, however, a large shortfall of approximately $2 billion remains between
identified annual cost reductions and needed cost reductions.


Labor
Agreements

In
February 2003, American asked its labor leaders and other employees for approximately $1.8 billion in permanent, annual savings through a combination of changes in
wages, benefits and work rules. The requested $1.8 billion in savings is divided by work group as follows: $660 million—pilots, $620 million—Transportation
Workers Union (TWU) represented employees, $340 million—flight attendants, $100 million—management and support staff, and $80 million—agents
and representatives. On March 31, 2003, the Company reached agreements with the leaders of the three major unions representing American employees (the Labor Agreements) and announced changes in
pay plans and benefits for non-unionized employees
(including officers and other management) which will meet the targeted contributions. Of the approximately $1.8 billion in savings, approximately $1.0 billion are to be accomplished
through wage and benefit reductions while the remaining approximately $.8 billion would be accomplished through changes in work rules which would result in additional job reductions. Wage
reductions became effective on April 1, 2003 for officers and will become effective on May 1, 2003 for all other employees. Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes will be
phased in over time. In connection with the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, the Labor Agreements provide for the issuance of approximately 38 million shares of AMR stock in the form
of stock options which will generally vest over a three year period (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). Although these Labor Agreements enabled
the Company to avoid an immediate filing of a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (a Chapter 11 filing), these Labor Agreements must still be ratified by the unions'
memberships. At the time of the filing of this Form 10-K, the unions have put the Labor Agreements out for a ratification vote. It is anticipated that the official results of the
voting will be formally announced on April 15, 2003. A group of pilots filed a lawsuit on April 14, 2003 contesting the union ratification process. The U.S. District Court in Fort Worth,
Texas denied the request for a temporary restraining order. Failure of one or more of the unions to ratify its Labor Agreement would likely lead the Company to initiate a Chapter 11 filing.

In
addition, the Company continues to negotiate concessions from its vendors, lessors and suppliers; however, the Company cannot reliably predict whether it will obtain the necessary
concessions or for what amount. In return for concessions, the Company plans to deliver shares of AMR common stock to its vendors, lessors and other creditors.

Even
if the Labor Agreements are ratified and the Company obtains concessions from its vendors, lessors and suppliers, the Company may nonetheless need to initiate a Chapter 11
filing because its financial condition will remain weak and its prospects uncertain. The fragility of the Company's financial condition is further illustrated by the going concern opinion of the
Company's independent auditors (see page 47). Other negative factors include but are not limited to, the failure of the U. S. economy to soon begin a recovery, a prolonged war in Iraq, another
terrorist attack, the failure of the Company to satisfy the liquidity requirement in certain of its credit agreements, or the inability of the Company to access the capital markets for additional
financing.

B. Other Events

While the Company was still recovering from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, American Airlines flight 587 crashed on November 12, 2001,
shortly after take-off from John F. Kennedy International Airport en route to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. In addition to the loss of all lives on board the aircraft, there
were several fatalities and injuries to persons on the ground as well as property damage. The National Transportation Safety Board is currently investigating the accident and a cause has yet to be
determined. As a result of the accident, claims have been filed against American. It is anticipated that these claims will be covered under American's insurance policy.


C. Competition

The domestic airline industry is fiercely competitive. Currently, any air carrier deemed fit by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is free to operate
scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its possessions. On most of its domestic non-stop routes, the Company faces competing service from at least one, and
sometimes more than one, major domestic airline including: Alaska Airlines, America West Airlines, Continental Airlines (Continental), Delta, Northwest Airlines (Northwest), Southwest Airlines, United
and US Airways, and their affiliated regional carriers. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where all nine major airlines may compete via their respective hubs. The
Company also competes with national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers and, particularly on shorter segments, ground transportation. On all of its routes, pricing decisions are
affected, in large part, by competition from other airlines. On over 80 percent of its domestic routes, the Company competes with airlines that have cost structures significantly lower than the
Company's and can therefore operate profitably at lower fare levels.

The
airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company's financial results because
the Company is generally required to match competitors' fares to maintain passenger traffic. During recent years, a number of new LCCs have entered the domestic market and several major airlines,
including the Company, implemented efforts to lower their cost structures. In addition, several air carriers have sought to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including
United and US Airways. (Effective March 31, 2003, US Airways emerged from its Chapter 11 restructuring.) Successful completion of such reorganizations has resulted or would result in
significantly lower operating costs for the reorganized carriers derived from labor, supply, and financing contracts renegotiated under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code. Historically, air
carriers involved in reorganizations have undertaken substantial fare discounting in order to maintain cash flows and enhance customer loyalty. Further fare reductions, domestic and international, may
occur in the future. If fare reductions are not offset by increases in passenger traffic, changes in the mix of traffic that improve yields and/or cost reductions, the Company's operating results will
be further negatively impacted. As discussed in Part A of Item 1, the Company has stated that its survival cannot be assured until labor and other costs are lowered significantly. See also
Part E of Item 1.

Most
major air carriers have developed hub-and-spoke systems and schedule patterns in an effort to maximize the revenue potential of their service. American
operates five hubs: Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago O'Hare, Miami, St. Louis and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Delta Air Lines (Delta) and United Air Lines (United) also have hub operations at DFW and
Chicago O'Hare, respectively.

The
American Eagle carriers increase the number of markets the Company serves by providing connections to American at American's hubs and certain other major airports. The American Eagle
carriers serve smaller markets through Boston, DFW, Chicago, Miami, San Juan, Los Angeles, Raleigh Durham and New York's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports. The AmericanConnection
carriers provide connecting service to American through St. Louis. American's competitors also own or have marketing agreements with regional carriers which provide similar services at their major
hubs.

In
addition to its extensive domestic service, the Company provides international service to the Caribbean, the Bahamas, Canada, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. The Company's
operating revenues from foreign operations were approximately 28 percent of the Company's total operating revenues in 2002 and 2001 and 30 percent of the Company's total operating
revenues in 2000. Additional information about the Company's foreign operations is included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.


The
majority of the tickets for travel on American and American Eagle are sold by travel agents. On March 18, 2002, American announced that it would no longer pay base commissions
on tickets issued by travel agents in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. As discussed in Item 3 Legal Proceedings, the Company is subject to legal challenges related to these changes.
Previously, domestic travel agents generally received a base commission of five percent of the price of the tickets they sold, capped at a maximum of $20 for a domestic roundtrip itinerary and $100
for an international roundtrip itinerary. American continues, however, to pay certain commissions to travel agents in connection with special revenue programs. American believes that other carriers
also no longer pay base commissions on tickets issued by travel agents but pay certain commissions in connection with their own special revenue programs. Accordingly, airlines compete not only with
respect to the price of the tickets sold but also with respect to the amount of special revenue program commissions paid.

The
growing use of electronic distribution systems provides the Company with an opportunity to lower its distribution costs. However, the continuous increase in pricing transparency
resulting from use of the Internet has enabled cost-conscious customers to more easily obtain the lowest fare on any given route. The Company continues to expand the capabilities of its
Internet website—AA.com—and the use of electronic ticketing throughout the Company's network. In addition, the Company, along with United, Continental, Delta and Northwest,
owns an interest in Orbitz, a travel planning website. Orbitz provides online access to airline, hotel, car rental and other travel services. The Company also has marketing agreements with other
internet travel services.

International
air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. In providing international air transportation, the Company competes with foreign investor-owned carriers,
state-owned carriers and U.S. airlines that have been granted authority to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations. The Company's operating
authority in these markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) and/or the relevant foreign governments. Because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the U.S. and the foreign country or
countries involved, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of such route authorities, or otherwise
adversely affect the Company's international operations. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various foreign countries served by the Company are subject to renegotiation. In addition, at some
foreign airports, an air carrier needs slots (landing and take-off authorizations) before the air carrier can introduce new service or increase existing service. The availability of such
slots is not assured and the inability of the Company to obtain and retain needed slots could therefore inhibit its efforts to compete in certain markets.

The
major U.S. air carriers have some advantage over foreign competitors in their ability to generate traffic from their extensive domestic route systems. In many cases, however, foreign
governments limit U.S. air carriers' rights to carry passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. To improve access to each other's markets, various U.S. and foreign air
carriers—including American—have established marketing relationships with other airlines and rail companies. American currently has marketing relationships with Aer Lingus, Air
Pacific, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern Airlines, EL AL, EVA Air, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LanChile, LOT Polish
Airlines, Qantas Airways, SN Brussels, SNCF, Southern Winds, Swiss International Air Lines, TACA Group, the TAM Group, TAP Air Portugal, Thalys, Trans States, and Turkish Airlines. American Eagle has
codesharing programs with Continental, Delta, Midwest Express and Northwest, in addition to codesharing
with some of American's codeshare partners. In the coming years, the Company expects to develop these programs further and to evaluate new alliances with other carriers.


American
is also a founding member of the

one

world alliance, which includes Aer Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair,
LanChile, Iberia, and Qantas. The

one

world alliance links the networks of the member carriers to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the
destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers' frequent flyer programs and access to the carriers' airport lounge facilities. Several of American's major competitors are members
of marketing/operational alliances that enjoy antitrust immunity. To the extent that American and British Airways, the largest members of the

one

world
alliance, are restricted in their relationship because they lack antitrust immunity, the carriers could be at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other alliances that have
antitrust immunity. On November 18, 2002, American and British Airways submitted an application with the DOT for approval of certain codeshare services as permitted under the existing bilateral
agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom. On April 9, 2003, the DOT issued an order tentatively giving American and British Airways permission to codeshare on a wide number of
flights beyond the carriers' gateways in the United Kingdom and the United States. The ruling provides a comment period until April 21, 2003. The carriers plan to begin codesharing as soon as
possible if the order is made final.

The
Company believes that it has several advantages relative to its competition. It operates a fleet that is efficient and quiet. It has a comprehensive domestic and international route
structure, anchored by efficient hubs, which permit it to take full advantage of whatever traffic growth occurs. The Company believes American's AAdvantage frequent flyer program, which is the largest
program in the industry, its More Room Throughout Coach program and its superior service also give it a competitive advantage. However, as discussed in Part A of Item 1 of this Report, these
competitive advantages are not sufficient in the short-term to overcome the economic difficulties currently facing the Company.

D. Regulation

General

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight
transportation. However, the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still exercise certain regulatory authority over air carriers. The DOT maintains jurisdiction over the approval of
international codeshare agreements, international route authorities and certain consumer protection and unfair competition matters, such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage
liability.

The
FAA regulates flying operations generally, including establishing personnel, aircraft and security standards. As part of that oversight, the FAA has implemented a number of
requirements that the Company is incorporating into its maintenance programs. These matters relate to, among other things, modifications to improve cockpit security on all fleet-types, enhanced ground
proximity warning systems, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 metal-mylar insulation replacement, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 main landing gear piston improvements, Boeing 757 and Boeing 767
pylon improvements, Boeing 737 elevator and rudder improvements, inspections to monitor Airbus A300 vertical stabilizers and Airbus A300 structural
improvements. Based on its current implementation schedule, the Company expects to be in compliance with the applicable requirements within the required time periods.

The
Department of Justice (DOJ) has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related
services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain regulatory functions with respect to
disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements. In addition, as a result of its international operations and alliances with
international carriers, the Company is subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies.

In
November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted. The ATSA created a new government agency, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA),
which is part of the DOT and is responsible for aviation security. The ATSA mandates that the TSA provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including U.S. mail, cargo,
carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft. The ATSA required all checked baggage to be screened by December 31, 2002. The TSA
assumed most passenger screening functions in February 2002, largely by contracting with private-sector security providers. The TSA has since replaced these contractors with its own federal
employees. The ATSA also provides for increased security on in cockpits of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights.


Effective
February 1, 2002, the ATSA imposed a $2.50 per enplanement security service fee ($5 one-way maximum fee) which is being collected by the air carriers and
submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures. Additionally, for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, air carriers are required to submit to the government an amount equal to what
the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000. After 2004, this fee may be assessed based on the air carrier's market share. See Part A of Item 1 for a discussion
of recent legislation which would provide for the suspension of the passenger security service fee from June 1, 2003 until October 1, 2003.

In
addition, the ATSA requires air carriers to honor tickets for suspended service on other air carriers that are insolvent or have declared bankruptcy within 18 months of the
passage of the ATSA. To be eligible, a passenger must make arrangements with the air carrier within 60 days after the date on which the passenger's air transportation was suspended. This
feature of the ATSA could have a significant impact on the Company. For example, if the Company is not reimbursed for honoring such tickets, the impact could be adverse.

As
described in Item 3—Legal Proceedings, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and several purported classes of private parties are pursuing litigation alleging that American
and American Eagle violated federal antitrust laws when competing with new air carriers. In April 2001, the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas granted American's motion for summary
judgment and dismissed the government's case. The DOJ has appealed and in September 2002 oral arguments were heard before the 10

th

Circuit Court of Appeals. The private lawsuits
have been stayed pending the outcome of the DOJ's appeal. Adverse court decisions could impose restrictions on the Company's ability to respond to competitors, or could result in awards of substantial
money damages to private parties, in which case the Company's business could be adversely impacted.

Airline Fares

Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation, and the industry is
characterized by substantial price competition. The DOT maintains authority over international fares, rates and charges. International fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the
governments of the foreign countries which the Company serves. While air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions, overrides and
discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets.

Legislation
(sometimes referred to as the "Passengers' Bill of Rights") has been discussed in various legislatures (including the Congress). This legislation could, if enacted:
(i) place various limitations on airline fares and/or (ii) affect operating practices such as baggage handling and overbooking. Effective December 15, 1999, the Company, as well
as other domestic airlines, implemented a Customer Service Plan to address a number of service goals, including, but not limited to, goals relating to: (i) lowest fare availability,
(ii) delays, cancellations and diversion events, (iii) baggage delivery and liability, (iv) guaranteed fares, (v) ticket refunds, (vi) accommodation of customers
with special needs, (vii) essential customer needs during extraordinary delays, (viii) flight oversales, (ix) Frequent Flyer Program—AAdvantage, (x) other
travel policies, (xi) service with domestic codeshare partners, and (xii) handling of customer issues. In February 2001, the DOT Inspector General issued a report on the various
air carriers' performance of their Customer Service Plans. The report included a number of recommendations which could limit the Company's flexibility with respect to various operational practices. In
February 2001, a bill proposing an "Airline Customer Service Improvement Act" was introduced in the U.S. Senate. In addition, other items of legislation have been introduced that would limit
hub concentration, reallocate slots at certain airports and impose higher landing fees at certain hours. To the extent legislation is enacted that would inhibit the Company's flexibility with respect
to fares, its revenue management system, its operations or other aspects of its customer service operations, the Company's financial results could be adversely affected.

Airport Access

In 1968, the FAA issued a rule designating New York John F. Kennedy, New York LaGuardia, Washington National (now Washington
Reagan), Chicago O'Hare and Newark airports as high-density traffic airports. Newark was subsequently removed from the high-density airport classification. The
high-density rule limits the number of Instrument Flight Rule operations—take-offs and landings—permitted per hour and requires that a slot support each
operation. In April 2000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21

st

Century (Air 21 Act) was enacted which: (i) eliminates slot restrictions at
New York John F. Kennedy and New York LaGuardia airports in 2007, (ii) shrank Chicago O'Hare's slot day from 0645 - 2114 hours to
1445 - 2014 hours starting July 2001, and (iii) eliminated Chicago O'Hare slots in July 2002. The Company does not expect the elimination of these
slot restrictions to have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations or its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Currently,
the FAA permits the purchasing, selling, leasing or transferring of slots except those slots designated as international, essential air service or Air 21 Act. Trading of any
slot is permitted subject to certain parameters. Most foreign airports, including London Heathrow, a major European destination for American, also have slot allocations. Most foreign authorities do
not permit the purchasing, selling or leasing of slots.

Although
the Company is constrained by slots, it currently has sufficient slot authorizations to operate its existing flights and has generally been able to obtain slots to expand its
operations and change its schedules.
However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain slots for these purposes in the future because, among other factors, domestic slot allocations are subject to changes in
government policies.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee
safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on the Company include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the Clean Air Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act).
The Company is also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on the Company's operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been
delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which
are similar to federal requirements.

The
ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or
foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The ANCA
generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft. While the Company has had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, the
Company's operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.

American
has been identified by the EPA as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Operating Industries, Inc. Superfund Site in California. Along with numerous other PRPs at
the Operating Industries Site, American has signed a series of partial consent decrees and a final consent decree with respect to the cleanup of contamination at that location. American is
participating with other PRPs in a Joint Defense Group and has signed an EPA Consent Decree along with other group members. The decree will enable American to resolve its past and present liabilities
at the Site in exchange for a one-time, lump-sum settlement payment. The Company expects the decree to become final in 2003 after completion of a public notice and comment
period.

The
EPA identified American as a PRP at the Mattiace Petrochemical Superfund Site located near Glen Cove, NY. American's alleged volumetric contributions are substantial when compared
with those of other PRPs. American is participating with other PRPs in a Joint Defense Group that is actively conducting settlement negotiations with the EPA and the State of New York. The Joint
Defense Group seeks a settlement on behalf of its members that will enable American to resolve its past and present liabilities at the Site in exchange for a one-time, lump-sum
settlement payment.

American,
along with most other tenants at the San Francisco International Airport (SFIA), has been ordered by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board to engage in various
studies of potential environmental contamination at the airport and to undertake remedial measures, if necessary. SFIA is also seeking to recover its past costs related to the contamination from the
tenants.


Miami-Dade
County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the
remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery methods. American and AMR Eagle have been named PRPs for the contamination at MIA. During the second quarter of 2001, the County filed
a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover its past and future cleanup costs (

Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo
Services, Inc., et al.

in the Florida Circuit Court). In addition to the 17 defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and
contributors to the contamination. American's and AMR Eagle's portion of the cleanup costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of the remedial actions
that may be required, the proportion of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately supervise
the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

In
1999, American was ordered by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to conduct remediation of environmental contamination located at Terminals 8 and 9
at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). In 2002, American began negotiating an order with NYSDEC for the remediation of a JFK off-terminal hangar facility. American is
seeking to recover a portion of the remediation costs from previous users of the Terminals 8 and 9 premises.

Also
in 1999, the Company entered a plea agreement with the U.S. Government with respect to a one count indictment relating to the storage of hazardous materials. As part of the plea
agreement, the Company was placed on probation for three years and adopted a comprehensive compliance program. The probation period ended in 2002.

In
1996, American and Executive, along with other tenants at the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico were notified by the Port Authority that it considered
them potentially responsible for environmental contamination at the airport. Since 1996, no further action has been taken against American or Executive.

American
Eagle Airlines, Inc. has been notified of its potential liability under New York law at an inactive hazardous waste site in Poughkeepsie, New York.

The
Company does not expect these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


E. Labor

The airline business is labor intensive. Wages, salaries and benefits represented approximately 41 percent of the Company's consolidated operating expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company's average equivalent number of employees for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 109,600.

Because
of, among other things, the continuing adverse economic climate, increased competition from LCCs, the continuing threat of terrorist actions and the war in Iraq, the airline
industry, including American, continues to be in severe distress. This has already caused two major carriers, United Air Lines, and USAirways, to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Through the Chapter 11 process, USAirways has reached permanent agreements with their unions and United has reached temporary agreements with their unions changing the rates of pay, benefits,
and work rules applicable to their unionized employees. (Effective March 31, 2003, US Airways emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization.) Those changes give those carriers a significant cost
advantage, as compared to American and their other competitors. All of these factors make it crucial that American dramatically and quickly reduce its costs to remain competitive. American has made a
large number of business changes which will reduce its annual costs by more than $2 billion. However, it believes that at least an additional $2 billion in cost reductions must occur and
that most of that must come from long-term labor cost reductions. In February 2003, American asked its labor leaders and employees for approximately $1.8 billion in
permanent, annual savings through a combination of changes in wages, benefits and work rules. On March 31, 2003, the Company reached agreements with the leaders of the three major unions
representing American employees and announced changes in pay plans and benefits for non-unionized employees (including officers and other management) which will meet the targeted
contributions. Of the approximately $1.8 billion in savings, approximately $1.0 billion are to be accomplished through wage and benefit reductions while the remaining approximately
$.8 billion would be accomplished through changes in work rules which would result in additional job reductions. Wage reductions became effective on April 1, 2003 for officers and will
become effective on May 1, 2003 for all other employees. Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes will be phased in over time. In connection with the changes in wages, benefits and
work rules, the Labor Agreements provide for the issuance of approximately 38 million shares of AMR stock in the form of stock options which will generally vest over a three year period (see
Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). Although these Labor Agreements enabled the Company to avoid an immediate filing of a petition for relief under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (a Chapter 11 filing), these Labor Agreements must still be ratified by the unions' memberships. At the time of the filing of this
Form 10-K, the unions have put the Labor Agreements out for a ratification vote. It is anticipated that the official results of the voting will be formally announced on
April 15, 2003. A group of pilots filed a lawsuit on April 14, 2003 contesting the union ratification process. The U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas denied the request for a
temporary restraining order. Failure of one or more of the unions to ratify its Labor Agreement would likely lead the Company to initiate a Chapter 11 filing. See Labor Agreements in
Part A of Item 1 for a discussion of other factors that may adversely affect the Company.

The
majority of the Company's employees are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company's relations with such labor organizations are
governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under this act, the collective bargaining agreements among the Company and these organizations generally do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated
date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for
direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (NMB) to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may
declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is
rejected by either party, a 30-day "cooling off" period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties'
positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by a "cooling off" period of 30 days. At the end of a "cooling off" period, unless an agreement is
reached or action is taken by
Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to "self-help", including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of workers to
replace strikers.

American
reached a new contract with the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) during 2001. The new contract becomes amendable on November 30, 2004.


American
reached new agreements with the TWU during 2001 concerning the eight employee groups represented by the TWU. The new agreements become amendable on March 1, 2004.

The
APA agreement became amendable August 31, 2001.

However,
if the Labor Agreements discussed above and in Part A of Item 1 are ratified, the new APFA, TWU and APA agreements will not become amendable until 2009.

A
provision in the scope clause of American's current contract with the APA limits the number of available seat miles (ASMs) and block hours that may be flown under American's marketing
code (AA) by American's regional carrier partners when American pilots are on furlough (the ASM cap). To ensure that American remained in compliance with the ASM cap, American and American Eagle took
several steps in 2002 to reduce the number of ASMs flown by American's commuter air carriers. As one of those measures, AMR Eagle signed a letter of intent to sell Executive Airlines, its San
Juan-based subsidiary. In December 2002, American and the APA began discussions on the contract limitations found in the scope clause. The APA agreed that American would have
temporary relief from compliance with the ASM cap while those discussions continued. That relief, coupled with other actions taken by American and American Eagle, will enable American Eagle to defer
the sale until later in 2003.

Another
provision in the current APA contract limits to 67 the total number of regional jets with more than 44 seats that can be flown under the AA code by American's regional carrier
partners. As AMR Eagle continues to accept previously-ordered Bombardier and Embraer regional jets this cap would be reached in early 2003. To ensure that American remains in compliance with the
67-aircraft cap, AMR Eagle has reached an agreement to dispose of 14 Embraer ERJ-145 aircraft from its fleet. The Company expects that these aircraft will be acquired by Trans
States Airlines, an AmericanConnection carrier, which will operate these aircraft under the Trans States Airlines marketing code (AX) at its St. Louis hub.

If
the Labor Agreement reached with the APA on March 31, 2003 is ratified, the provisions in the APA contract described in the immediately preceding two paragraphs will be
modified to give the Company more flexibility with its American Eagle operations.

The
Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents American Eagle pilots, reached agreement with American Eagle effective September 1, 1997, to have all of the pilots of the
Eagle carriers covered by a single
collective bargaining agreement. This agreement lasts until October 31, 2013. The agreement provides to the parties the right to seek limited changes in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. If the
parties are unable to agree on the limited changes, they also agreed that the issues would be resolved by interest arbitration, without the exercise of self-help (such as a strike). ALPA
and American Eagle negotiated a tentative agreement in 2000, but that agreement failed in ratification. Thereafter, the parties participated in interest arbitration. The interest arbitration panel
determined the limited changes which should be made and these changes were appropriately effected.

The
Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), which represents the flight attendants of the Eagle carriers, reached agreement with American Eagle effective March 2, 1998, to have
all flight attendants of the American Eagle carriers covered by a single contract. The agreement became amendable on September 2, 2001. However, the parties agreed to commence negotiations over
amendments to the agreement in March 2001. The parties are still engaged in direct negotiations. The other union employees at the American Eagle carriers are covered by separate agreements with
the TWU which were effective April 28, 1998, and are amendable April 28, 2003. American Eagle and the TWU have already commenced negotiations.


The
non-union employees formerly with TWA LLC have largely been integrated into the Company's work force. The integration of unionized employees from TWA LLC who had to be
integrated into unionized groups at American has been more complex. The Company first engaged facilitators to work with American's and TWA LLC's unions in attempting to reach integration agreements
acceptable to all unions from both carriers. Unfortunately, those discussions were unable to produce agreements acceptable to the relevant unions at both carriers. American thereafter had separate
discussions with the unions at American. It reached integration agreements with the APA (with respect to pilot integration) and the APFA (with respect to flight attendant integration). American and
the TWU participated in arbitration, which process resolved certain unionized ground employee integration issues in late February and early March 2002. In early April, 2002, the NMB declared
American and TWA LLC a single carrier for labor relations purposes and designated American's incumbent unions as the collective bargaining representatives of the relevant work groups at both American
and TWA LLC. Since American's unions thereafter represented the relevant employees at both carriers, the integration mechanisms reached with the unions at American could then begin to be applied. The
integration of the unionized work groups is occurring in accordance with those mechanisms.

F. Fuel

2002 were:

The
amounts for 2002 and 2001 reflect the January 1, 2001 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133); the 2000 amounts do not. See a further discussion of the impact of SFAS 133 to the Company in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

The impact of fuel price changes on the Company and its competitors is dependent upon various factors, including hedging strategies. The Company
has a fuel hedging program in which it enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude swap and option contracts to protect against increases in jet fuel prices, which has had the effect of reducing the
Company's average cost per gallon. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company's fuel hedging program reduced the Company's fuel expense by approximately $4 million, $29 million and
$545 million, respectively. To reduce the impact of potential fuel price increases in 2003, as of December 31, 2002, the Company had hedged approximately 32 percent of its
estimated 2003 fuel requirements. Based on projected fuel usage, the Company estimates that a 10 percent increase in the price per gallon of fuel as of December 31, 2002 would result in
an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $205 million in 2003, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2002. The decline in the Company's credit rating, as
discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources of Item 7, has limited its ability to enter into certain types of fuel hedge contracts. A further deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position
may negatively affect the Company's ability to hedge fuel in the future. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, in the event of continuing increases in the price of jet fuel, there can
be no assurance that the Company will be able to pass on increased fuel prices to its customers by increasing its fares. Likewise, any potential benefit of lower fuel prices may be offset by increased
fare competition and lower revenues for all air carriers.


While
the Company does not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability, dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government
policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel. In the event there is an outbreak of hostilities or other conflicts in
oil producing areas or elsewhere, such as the war in Iraq or domestic turmoil, as recently seen in Venezuela and Nigeria, there could be reductions in the production and/or importation of crude oil
and/or significant increases in the cost of fuel. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost, the Company's business, as well as that of the
entire industry, would be adversely affected.

Additional
information regarding the Company's fuel program is included in Item 7(A)—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and in Note 9 to the
consolidated financial statements.

G. Frequent Flyer Program

American established the AAdvantage frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued
patronage. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits for flights on American, American Eagle and certain other participating airlines, or by using services of other program participants, including bank
credit card issuers, hotels and car rental and phone service companies. American sells mileage credits and related services to the other companies participating in the program. American reserves the
right to change the AAdvantage program rules, regulations, travel awards and special offers at any time without notice. American may initiate changes impacting, for example, participant affiliations,
rules for earning mileage credit, mileage levels and awards, limited seating for travel awards, and the features of special offers. American reserves the right to end the AAdvantage program with six
months' notice.

Mileage
credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or participating airlines, or for other travel industry awards. Once a member accrues
sufficient mileage for an award, the member may request an award certificate from American. Award certificates may be redeemed up to one year after issuance. Most travel awards are subject to capacity
controlled seating. Miles do not expire, provided a customer has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 36 months.

American
uses the incremental cost method to account for the portion of its frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American or
American Eagle. American's frequent flyer liability is accrued each time a member accumulates sufficient mileage in his or her account to claim the lowest level of free travel award (25,000 miles) and
such award is expected to be used for free travel. American includes fuel, food, and reservations/ticketing costs, but not a contribution to overhead or profit, in the calculation of incremental cost.
These estimates are generally updated based upon the Company's 12-month historical average of such costs. The cost for fuel is estimated based on total fuel consumption tracked by various
categories of markets, with an amount allocated to each passenger. Food costs are tracked by market category, with an amount allocated to each passenger. Reservation/ticketing costs are based on the
total number of passengers, including those traveling on free awards, divided into American's total expense for these costs.

Revenue
earned from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies participating in American's frequent flyer program is recognized in two components. The first component represents the
revenue for air transportation sold and is valued at current market rates. This revenue is deferred and recognized over the period the mileage is expected to be used, which is currently estimated to
be 28 months. The second revenue component, representing the marketing products sold and administrative costs associated with operating the AAdvantage program, is recognized immediately.

At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, American estimated that approximately 9.3 million and 8.7 million free travel awards, respectively, were expected to be redeemed for
free travel on American and American Eagle. In making the estimate of free travel awards, American has excluded mileage in inactive accounts, mileage related to accounts that have not yet reached the
lowest level of free travel award, and mileage in active accounts that have reached the lowest level of free travel award but which are not expected to ever be redeemed for free travel on American.
The resulting liability was approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, representing 16.2 percent and 14.9 percent of AMR's total current liabilities, at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


The
number of free travel awards used for travel on American and American Eagle in 2002 was 3.5 million, representing approximately 8.1 percent of passengers boarded.
Comparatively, the number of free travel awards used for travel on American and American Eagle (excluding TWA LLC) was 2.7 million in 2001 and 2.8 million in 2000, representing
approximately 7.4 percent of total passengers boarded in 2001 and 7 percent in 2000 (excluding TWA LLC). The Company believes displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given the
Company's load factors, its ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory, and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total passengers boarded.

H. Other Matters

Seasonality and Other Factors

The Company's results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the
entire year, since the air transportation business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.

The
results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions. In addition, fears of terrorism or
war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Unaudited quarterly financial data for the two-year period ended
December 31, 2002 is included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

No
material part of the business of AMR and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. Consequently, the loss of the Company's largest few customers
would not have a materially adverse effect upon the Company.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and all-risk coverage for
damage to its aircraft, in amounts which, in the opinion of management, are adequate.

As
a result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to
persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, they significantly increased the
premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general.

The
U.S. government has provided commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines until June 13, 2003 covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and
aircraft. The Company believes this insurance coverage will be extended beyond June 13, 2003 because the Homeland Security Act provides for this insurance to remain in place until
August 31, 2003. In addition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2003, at his discretion. See Part A of Item 1 for a discussion of
recent legislation which would provide for the extension of war-risk insurance through September 30, 2004.

In
the event the commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to the Company or significantly increase the cost of aviation insurance, or if
the Government fails to renew the war-risk insurance that it provides, the Company's operations and/or financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.

Other Government Matters

In time of war or during an unlimited national emergency or civil defense emergency, American and other air
carriers can be required to provide airlift services to the Air Mobility Command under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program (CRAF). The Air Mobility Command, which runs CRAF, has activated stage one of
CRAF as part of the U.S. government's build-up for military action in Iraq and has notified American that it requires five airplanes including three 777s and two 767-300s with
crews. American has been planning for the potential activation of stage one of CRAF and is having no problems meeting its current CRAF obligations. If the Air Mobility Command activates stage two of
CRAF, American will be obligated to provide up to 18 additional aircraft. In the event the Company has to provide a substantial amount of additional services, its operations could be adversely
impacted.

Airlines aircraft totals include 27 Boeing 757-200s and 103 McDonnell Douglas MD-80s that were formerly TWA aircraft

In addition, the following owned and leased aircraft were not operated by the Company as of December 31, 2002: seven owned Boeing
727-200s, 14 operating leased Boeing 717-200s, 11 operating leased McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, six owned McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10s, four
operating leased McDonnell Douglas MD-80s, eight operating leased Boeing 767-300s, six owned Embraer 145s and 16 capital leased and two owned Saab 340Bs.

Of
the non-operating aircraft discussed above, five McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 aircraft were being leased to Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (Hawaiian)
as of December 31, 2002 and six Embraer 145 aircraft are currently being leased to Trans States Airlines (Trans States). Upon termination of the lease agreement with Hawaiian, the Company has
agreed to sell the remaining six McDonnell Douglas DC10-10 aircraft to FedEx Corporation in 2003. In addition, Trans States has agreed to acquire a total of 14 Embraer 145 aircraft from
the Company, including the six non-operating Embraer 145s discussed above, in 2003. The Company is actively marketing its remaining non-operating aircraft and does not
anticipate bringing these aircraft back into its operations.

Of
the operating aircraft in the above table, 28 McDonnell Douglas MD-80s, eight Boeing 767-200s and six Boeing 767-200ERs will be placed in temporary
storage beginning in 2003.

Substantially
all of the Company's aircraft leases include an option to purchase the aircraft or to extend the lease term, or both, with the purchase price or renewal rental to be based
essentially on the market value of the aircraft at the end of the term of the lease or at a predetermined fixed amount. The Company does not intend to purchase or extend the lease term on any aircraft
with lease expirations in 2003.

Ground Properties

The Company leases, or has built as leasehold improvements on leased property, most of its airport and terminal facilities; maintenance and training facilities in
Fort Worth, Texas; its principal overhaul and maintenance bases at Tulsa International Airport (Tulsa, Oklahoma), Kansas City International Airport (Kansas City, Missouri) and Alliance Airport (Fort
Worth, Texas); its regional reservation offices; and local ticket and administration offices throughout the system. American has entered into agreements with the Tulsa Municipal Airport Trust; the
Alliance Airport Authority, Fort Worth, Texas; the New York City Industrial Development Agency; and the Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare, Newark, San Juan, and Los Angeles airport authorities to
provide funds for constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment which are or will be leased to the Company. The Company also uses public airports for its flight operations
under lease or use arrangements with the municipalities or governmental agencies owning or controlling them and leases certain other ground equipment for use at its facilities.

information concerning the estimated lives and residual values for owned ground properties, lease terms and amortization relating to ground properties under capital leases, and
acquisitions of ground properties, see Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On July 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in November 1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American
Airlines, Inc., AMR Eagle Holding Corporation, Airlines Reporting Corporation, and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, Western Division (

Westways World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp., et al.

). The lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos to American
for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of the agencies): (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American and AMR Eagle and the plaintiffs; (2) constitutes
unjust enrichment; and (3) violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). The as yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have been or will be
required to pay money to American for debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995 to the present. The plaintiffs seek to enjoin American from enforcing the pricing rules in
question and to recover the amounts paid for debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. A final adverse court decision could
impose restrictions on the Company's relationships with travel agencies which, restrictions could have an adverse impact on the Company.

On
May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and AMR Eagle Holding
Corporation in federal court in Wichita, Kansas (

United States v. AMR Corporation, et al, No. 99-1180-JTM, United States District Court for the District of
Kansas

). The lawsuit alleges that American unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) by
increasing service when new competitors began flying to DFW, and by matching these new competitors' fares. The Department of Justice seeks to enjoin American from engaging in the alleged improper
conduct and to impose restraints on American to remedy the alleged effects of its past conduct. On April 27, 2001, the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas granted American's motion
for summary judgment. On June 26, 2001, the U.S. Department of Justice appealed the granting of American's motion for summary judgment (

United States v.
AMR Corporation, et al, No. 01-3203, United States District Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit

), and on September 23, 2002, the parties presented oral
arguments to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has not yet issued its decision. The Company intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. A final adverse court decision imposing restrictions on the
Company's ability to respond to competitors would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Between
May 14, 1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits were filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in
the United States District Court in Wichita, Kansas seeking treble damages under federal and state antitrust laws, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees (

King v. AMR Corp., et
al.

;

Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.

;

Team Electric v. AMR Corp., et al.

;

Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.

;

Whittier v. AMR Corp., et al.

;

Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.

; and

Youngdahl v. AMR Corp., et al.

). Collectively,
these lawsuits allege that American unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from DFW by increasing service when new competitors began flying to DFW, and by
matching these new competitors' fares. Two of the suits (

Smith

and

Wright

) also allege that American unlawfully monopolized or attempted to
monopolize airline passenger service to and from DFW by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions on the use and
availability of certain fares, and by offering override commissions to travel agents. The suits propose to certify several classes of consumers, the broadest of which is all persons who purchased
tickets for air travel on American into or out of DFW from 1995 to the present. On November 10, 1999, the District Court stayed all of these actions pending developments in the case brought by
the Department of Justice (see above description). As a result, to date no class has been certified. The Company intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously. One or more final adverse court decisions
imposing restrictions on the Company's ability to respond to competitors or awarding substantial money damages would have an adverse impact on the Company.


On
May 17, 2002, the named plaintiffs in

Hall, et al. v. United Airlines, et al.

, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of North Carolina, filed an amended complaint alleging that between 1995 and the present, American and over 15 other defendant airlines conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents
in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The court granted class action certification to the plaintiff on September 17, 2002, defining the plaintiff class as all travel agents in
the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, who, at any time from October 1, 1997 to the present, issued tickets, miscellaneous change orders, or prepaid ticket
advices for travel on any of the defendant airlines. The case is stayed as to US Airways and United Air Lines, since they filed for bankruptcy. American is vigorously defending the lawsuit. Defendant
carriers filed a motion for summary judgment on December 10, 2002. Trial is set for September 02, 2003. A final adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions
on the Company's commission policies or practices would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On
April 26, 2002, six travel agencies filed

Albany Travel Co., et al. v. Orbitz, LLC, et al.

, in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California against American, United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines, and Orbitz, LLC, alleging that American and the other defendants: (i) conspired to prevent travel agents from acting
as effective competitors in the distribution of airline tickets to passengers in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act; and (ii) conspired to monopolize the distribution of common
carrier air travel between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The named plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class of travel agents, but no class has
yet been certified. American is vigorously defending the lawsuit. On November 25, 2002, the District Court stayed this case pending a judgment in Hall et. al. v. United Airlines, et. al. (see
above description). A final adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on the Company's distribution practices would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On
April 25, 2002, a collection of 38 Quebec travel agencies filed

Voyages Montambault (1989), Inc. v. International Air Transport Association,
et al.

, seeking a declaratory judgment of the Superior Court in Montreal, Canada that American and the other airline defendants owe a "fair and reasonable commission" to the
agencies, and that American and the other airline defendants breached alleged contracts with these agencies by adopting policies of not paying base commissions. The defendants are the International
Air Transport Association, the Air Transport Association, Air Canada, American, America West, Delta Air Lines, Grupo TACA, Northwest Airlines/KLM Airlines, United Air Lines, US Airways, and
Continental Airlines. American is vigorously defending the lawsuit. A final adverse court decision granting declaratory relief could expose the Company to claims for substantial money damages or force
the Company to pay agency commissions, either of which would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On
May 13, 2002, the named plaintiffs in

Always Travel, et. al. v. Air Canada, et. al.

, pending in the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division,
Montreal, filed a statement of claim alleging that between 1995 and the present, American, the other defendant airlines, and the International Air Transport Association conspired to reduce commissions
paid to Canada-based travel agents in violation of Section 45 of the Competition Act of Canada. The named plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class of travel agents. Plaintiffs' motion for
certification is set for hearing on September 2, 2003. American is vigorously defending the lawsuit. A final adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on
the Company's commission policies would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On
August 14, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against American Airlines, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Western
Division (

All World Professional Travel Services, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc.

). The lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos for
refunding tickets after September 11, 2001: (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American and plaintiff; (2) constitutes unjust enrichment; and (3) violates
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). The as yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay moneys to American for an
"administrative service charge," "penalty fee," or other fee for processing refunds on behalf of passengers who were unable to use their tickets in the days immediately following the resumption of air
carrier service after tragedies on September 11, 2001. The plaintiff seeks to enjoin American from collecting the debit memos and to recover the amounts paid for the debit memos, plus treble
damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit, an adverse court decision could impose
restrictions on the Company's relationships with travel agencies which restrictions could have an adverse impact on the Company.


On
August 19, 2002, a U.S. travel agency filed

Power Travel International, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., et al.

, in New York state
court against American, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, United Air Lines, and Northwest Airlines, alleging that American and the other defendants breached their contracts with
the agency as well as the duty of good faith and fair dealing when these carriers at various times reduced base commissions to zero. The plaintiff seeks to certify a nationwide class of travel agents,
but no class has yet been certified. The plaintiff dismissed JetBlue from the lawsuit, and the remaining defendants removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. The case is stayed as to United Air Lines, since it filed for bankruptcy. American is vigorously defending the lawsuit, and has filed a motion to dismiss it. A final adverse court decision
awarding substantial money damages or forcing the Company to pay agency commissions would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Miami-Dade
County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the
remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery methods. American Airlines, Inc. and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination
at MIA. During the second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and future cleanup costs
(

Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo Services, Inc., et al.

in the Florida Circuit Court). In addition to the 17 defendants named in the
lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination. American's and AMR Eagle's portion of the cleanup costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to
various factors, including the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and uncertainties
regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately supervise the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October 1982. AMR's principal subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc., was founded in 1934. On
April 9, 2001, Trans World Airlines LLC (TWA LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines, Inc.) purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans
World Airlines, Inc. (TWA). Accordingly, the operating results of TWA LLC are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2002 whereas for 2001 the results of TWA LLC are included only for the period April 10, 2001 through December 31, 2001. All references to American Airlines, Inc. include the
operations of TWA LLC since April 10, 2001 (collectively, American) (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). American is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the
world. In addition, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMR, owns two regional airlines which do business as "American Eagle". AMR's operations fall almost entirely
in the airline industry.

Results of Operations

AMR's net loss in 2002 was $3.5 billion, or $22.57 per share. AMR's net loss in 2001 was $1.8 billion, or $11.43 per share. The Company's 2002
results include a one-time, non-cash charge to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, effective January 1, 2002, of $988 million, or $6.35 per
share, to write-off all of AMR's goodwill upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (see Note 4 to
the consolidated financial statements). The Company's 2002 results were adversely impacted by the continued economic slowdown and the residual effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks as discussed in Part A of Item 1. For a discussion of the events of September 11, 2001, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

REVENUES

2002 Compared to 2001

Although traffic has continued to increase on reduced capacity since the events of September 11, 2001, the
Company's 2002 revenues and yields were down materially year-over-year. In addition to the residual effects of September 11, the Company's revenues continue to be
negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines and changes in business traveler profiles; the geographic distribution of the Company's network; and reduced
fares due in part to increased competition from low-cost carriers. The Company's revenues decreased approximately $1.7 billion, or 8.8 percent, to $17.3 billion.

American's
passenger revenues decreased by 8.5 percent, or $1.3 billion, to $14.4 billion. System wide, passenger revenue yield per passenger mile decreased by
9.3 percent, or 1.22 cents, to 11.86 cents, driving American's revenue per available seat mile (RASM) down by 7.2 percent, or .65 cents, to 8.39 cents. In 2002, American derived
approximately 70 percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 30 percent from international operations. American's domestic RASM decreased
8.8 percent, to 8.26 cents, on a capacity decrease of 1 percent to 125 billion available seat miles (ASMs). International RASM decreased to 8.72 cents, or 2.8 percent, on a
capacity decrease of 7.2 percent to 47 billion ASMs. The decrease in international RASM was due to a 7.1 percent decrease in Latin American RASM, somewhat offset by a
6.5 percent and 0.3 percent increase in Pacific and European RASM, respectively. The decrease in international capacity was due to a 22.4 percent, 7.9 percent and
3.3 percent reduction in Pacific, European and Latin American ASMs, respectively. AMR Eagle's passenger revenues decreased $46 million, or 3.3 percent, to $1.3 billion. AMR
Eagle's traffic increased 11 percent, or 409 million revenue passenger miles (RPMs), to 4.1 billion RPMs, while capacity increased 1.9 percent, or 121 million ASMs,
to 6.6 billion ASMs. Similar to American, the decrease in AMR Eagle's revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the
economic slowdown.

Cargo
revenues decreased 15.3 percent, or $101 million, to $561 million primarily due to the economic slowdown and significant restrictions on cargo shipments for
security reasons.

Other
revenues decreased 15.5 percent, or $177 million, to $966 million due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for other
airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service charges.


2001 Compared to 2000

The Company's 2001 revenues, yield, RPMs and ASMs were severely impacted by the September 11,
2001 terrorist attacks, the Company's reduced operating schedule, a worsening of the U.S. economy that had already been dampening the demand for travel both domestically and internationally prior to
the September 11, 2001 events, business travel declines as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks, and increased fare sale activity occurring subsequent to the September 11
attacks to encourage passengers to resume flying. The Company's revenues decreased approximately $740 million, or 3.8 percent, versus 2000. However, excluding TWA LLC's revenues for the
period April 10, 2001 through December 31, 2001, the Company's revenues would have decreased approximately $2.6 billion versus 2000.

For
comparability purposes, the following discussion does not combine American's and TWA's results of operations or related statistics for 2001. American's passenger revenues decreased
by 14 percent, or $2.3 billion. In 2001, American derived approximately 68 percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 32 percent from
international operations. American's domestic RASM
decreased 11.3 percent, to 9.28 cents, on a capacity decrease of 5 percent to 104 billion ASMs. International RASM decreased to 9.07 cents, or 5.2 percent, on a
capacity decrease of 4.9 percent. The decrease in international RASM was led by an 11.8 percent and 10.8 percent decrease in Pacific and European RASM, respectively, slightly
offset by a 0.9 percent increase in Latin American RASM. The decrease in international capacity was driven by a 6.5 percent and 4.7 percent reduction in Latin American and
European ASMs, respectively, partially offset by an increase in Pacific capacity of 2.8 percent.

TWA
LLC's passenger revenues were approximately $1.7 billion for the period April 10, 2001 through December 31, 2001. TWA LLC's RASM was 7.74 cents on capacity of
21.7 billion ASMs.

AMR
Eagle's passenger revenues decreased $74 million, or 5.1 percent. AMR Eagle's traffic remained flat compared to 2000, at 3.7 billion RPMs, while capacity
increased to 6.5 billion ASMs, or 3.4 percent. Similar to American, the decrease in AMR Eagle's revenues was due primarily to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and a
worsening of the U.S. economy that had already been dampening the demand for air travel prior to the events of September 11, 2001.

Cargo
revenues decreased 8.2 percent, or $59 million, for the same reasons as noted above.

2002 Compared to 2001

The Company's operating expenses decreased 3.8 percent, or $804 million, to $20.6 billion.
American's operating expenses per ASM decreased 1.5 percent to 11.14 cents, including the impact of special charges and U.S. Government grant of $625 million and $10 million,
respectively, in 2002 and $1.2 billion and $827 million, respectively, in 2001. The decrease in operating expenses and operating expenses per ASM is largely due to cost savings
initiatives implemented in late 2001 and 2002. Wages, salaries and benefits increased 4.5 percent, or $360 million, to $8.4 billion, reflecting (i) higher salaries, largely
offset by a decrease in the average number of equivalent employees and (ii) increases in the Company's pension and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and
prescription drug costs. Aircraft fuel expense decreased 11.3 percent, or $326 million, to $2.6 billion, primarily due to a 3.3 percent decrease in the Company's fuel
consumption and a 6.4 percent decrease in the Company's average price per gallon. Depreciation and amortization decreased $38 million, or 2.7 percent, to $1.4 billion due
primarily to discontinuing amortization of goodwill and route acquisition costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets".
Commissions, booking fees and credit card expense decreased 25.4 percent, or $384 million, to $1.1 billion, due primarily to an 8.1 percent decrease in passenger revenues
and commission structure changes implemented in March 2002. Food service decreased 10.3 percent, or $80 million, to $698 million, due primarily to the Company's reduced
operating schedule and reductions in the level of food service. Special charges for 2002 included approximately $658 million related to aircraft charges, $57 million in employee charges
and $3 million in facility charges. Special charges for 2001 included approximately $1.2 billion related to aircraft charges, $115 million in facility charges, $71 million
in employee charges and $43 million in other charges. U.S. Government grant includes a $10 million and $856 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the U.S.
Government under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Act) for 2002 and
2001, respectively. See a further discussion of special charges and U.S. Government grant in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Other operating expenses decreased
12.9 percent, or $389 million, to $2.6 billion, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for other airlines, and decreases in travel and
incidental costs, advertising and promotion costs, and data processing expenses, which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs.


2001 Compared to 2000

The Company's operating expenses increased 17 percent, or approximately $3.1 billion. However,
excluding TWA LLC's expenses for the period April 10, 2001 through December 31, 2001, the Company's expenses would have increased approximately $888 million versus 2000. In
addition to the specific explanations provided below, the significant decline in passenger traffic resulting from the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 and resulting reduced operating
schedule caused a favorable impact on certain passenger-related operating expenses, including aircraft fuel, other rentals and landing fees, commissions to agents and booking and credit card fees, and
food service. American's cost per ASM increased 9.4 percent to 11.46 cents, excluding TWA LLC and including the impact of special charges and U.S. Government grant. The increase in American's
cost per ASM was driven partially by a reduction in ASMs due to the Company's More Room Throughout Coach program. Removing the impact of this program, American's cost per ASM grew approximately
6.3 percent, excluding TWA LLC and including the impact of special charges and U.S. Government grant. Wages, salaries and benefits increased 18.4 percent, or $1.3 billion, and
included approximately $920 million related to the addition of TWA. The remaining increase of approximately $329 million related primarily to an increase in the average number of
equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the Company's labor contracts. During 2001, the Company recorded approximately $300 million in
additional wages, salaries and benefits related primarily to the Company's new contracts with its flight attendants and Transport Workers Union work groups. This was mostly offset by a
$328 million decrease in the provision for profit-sharing as compared to 2000. Aircraft fuel expense increased 15.8 percent, or $393 million, and included approximately
$322 million related to the addition of TWA LLC. The remaining increase in aircraft fuel expense was due to a 4.2 percent increase in the Company's average price per gallon, partially
offset by a 3.7 percent decrease in the Company's fuel consumption, excluding TWA LLC. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 16.8 percent, or $202 million, due primarily
to the addition of new aircraft and an increase of approximately $88 million related to TWA. Commissions to agents and booking and credit card fees decreased 8.6 percent, or
$142 million, and included approximately $174 million related to TWA LLC. The decrease in commissions, booking fees and credit card expense was due primarily to a 13.2 percent
decrease in passenger revenues, excluding TWA LLC, and the benefit from commission structure changes implemented in 2000. Other rentals and landing fees increased $198 million, or
19.8 percent, and included approximately $130 million related to the addition of TWA LLC. The remaining increase of $68 million was due primarily to higher facilities rent and
landing fees across the Company's system. Aircraft rentals increased $222 million, or 36.6 percent, due primarily to the addition of TWA LLC aircraft. Other operating expenses increased
11.4 percent, or $308 million, and included approximately $244 million related to TWA LLC. Special charges included approximately $1.2 billion related to aircraft charges,
$115 million in facility exit costs, $71 million in employee charges and $43 million in other charges. U.S. Government grant included an $856 million benefit recognized for
the reimbursement from the U.S. Government under the Act. See a further discussion of special charges and U.S. Government grant in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

Other
income (expense) consists of interest income and expense, interest capitalized and miscellaneous—net.

2002 Compared to 2001

Other expense increased $244 million, or 85.3 percent, to $530 million due primarily to the
following: Interest income decreased $39 million, or 35.5 percent, to $71 million due primarily to decreases in interest rates. Interest expense increased $147 million, or
27.3 percent, to $685 million resulting primarily from the increase in the Company's long-term debt of approximately $2.6 billion. Interest capitalized decreased
$58 million, or 40.3 percent, to $86 million due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment.

2001 Compared to 2000

Interest income decreased $44 million, or 28.6 percent, resulting from lower investment balances
throughout most of 2001. Interest expense increased $71 million, or 15.2 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in long-term debt of approximately
$4.2 billion. Miscellaneous—net decreased $70 million due primarily to Miscellaneous—net in 2001 including a $45 million gain from the settlement of a
legal matter related to the Company's 1999 labor disruption, offset by the write-down of certain investments held by the Company. This compares to Miscellaneous-net in 2000
including a $57 million gain on the sale of the Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline.com Incorporated (priceline) common stock and a gain of approximately
$41 million from the recovery of start-up expenses from the Canadian Airlines International Limited (Canadian) services agreement.


INCOME TAX PROVISION (BENEFIT)


The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 was impacted by a $57 million charge resulting from a
provision in Congress' economic stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs). This change allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years,
rather than two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover its NOLs. The extended NOL carryback did however result in the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in
prior years. These credits are now expected to expire before being utilized by the Company, resulting in this charge.

On
April 9, 2001, TWA LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of American) purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc.
(TWA). Accordingly, the 2001 financial information above includes the operating results of TWA LLC since the date of acquisition. See a further discussion of the TWA acquisition in Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

In response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Company initiated the following measures: reduced capacity by approximately 20 percent,
grounded aircraft and deferred certain aircraft deliveries to future years, significantly reduced capital spending, closed facilities, reduced its workforce (see Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information) and implemented numerous other cost reduction initiatives.

In
2002, given, among other things: (i) the steep fall-off in demand for air travel, particularly business travel, caused by the continuing weakness of the U.S.
economy, (ii) reduced pricing power, resulting mainly from greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers, especially business travelers, and increasing competition from low cost carriers,
and (iii) the residual effects of September 11, the Company announced a series of initiatives to further reduce its costs, simplify its aircraft fleet, and enhance productivity. These
initiatives included, among other things, de-peaking of the Company's Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport hub (following the de-peaking of its Chicago hub); gradually
phasing out operation of its Fokker aircraft fleet; and reducing capacity in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, the Company reduced its workforce to better align its workforce with the planned
capacity reductions, fleet simplification, and hub restructurings. Despite the Company's on-going efforts to reduce its costs, many of its costs are attributable to factors largely beyond
the Company's control, including (i) escalating fuel prices, (ii) increased insurance costs and (iii) increased security costs.

As
discussed in Part A of Item 1, the Company's recent financial results are unsustainable. Given the severity of the Company's financial situation and the Company's belief that a
permanent shift has occurred in the airline revenue environment, the Company continues to review its business model, particularly with a view towards identifying significant cost reductions. The
Company believes that it must quickly reduce its annual operating costs by at least $4 billion in order to become competitive and sustain its operations. The Company has made progress in
identifying more than $2 billion in annual operating cost reductions via initiatives involving: (i) scheduling efficiencies, including de-peaking certain of its hubs as
referred to above, (ii) fleet simplification, (iii) streamlined customer interaction, (iv) distribution modifications, (v) in-flight product changes,
(vi) operational changes and (vii) headquarters/administration efficiencies. Even with these initiatives, however, a large shortfall of approximately $2 billion remains between
identified annual cost reductions and needed cost reductions.

In
February 2003, American asked its labor leaders and other employees for approximately $1.8 billion in permanent, annual savings through a combination of changes in
wages, benefits and work rules. The requested $1.8 billion in savings is divided by work group as follows: $660 million—pilots, $620 million—Transportation
Workers Union (TWU) represented employees, $340 million—flight attendants, $100 million—management and support staff, and $80 million—agents
and representatives. On March 31, 2003, the Company reached agreements with the leaders of the three major unions representing American employees (the Labor Agreements) and announced changes in
pay plans and benefits for non-unionized employees (including officers and other management) which will meet the targeted contributions. Of the approximately $1.8 billion in
savings, approximately $1.0 billion are to be accomplished through wage and benefit reductions while the remaining approximately $.8 billion would be accomplished through changes in work
rules which would result in additional job reductions. Wage reductions became effective on April 1, 2003 for officers and will become effective on May 1, 2003 for all other employees.
Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes will be phased in over time. In connection with the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, the Labor Agreements provide for the issuance of
approximately 38 million shares of AMR stock in the form of stock options which will generally vest over a three year period (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information). Although these Labor Agreements enabled the Company to avoid an immediate filing of a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (a Chapter 11
filing), these Labor Agreements must still be ratified by the unions' memberships. At the time of the filing of this Form 10-K, the unions have put the Labor Agreements out for a
ratification vote. It is anticipated that the official results of the voting will be formally announced on April 15, 2003. A group of pilots filed a lawsuit on April 14, 2003 contesting
the union ratification process. The U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas denied the request for a temporary restraining order. Failure of one or more of the unions to ratify its Labor Agreement
would likely lead the Company to initiate a Chapter 11 filing.


In
addition, the Company continues to negotiate concessions from its vendors, lessors and suppliers; however, the Company cannot reliably predict whether it will obtain the necessary
concessions or for what amount. In return for concessions, the Company plans to deliver shares of AMR common stock to its vendors, lessors and other creditors.

Even
if the Labor Agreements are ratified and the Company obtains concessions from its vendors, lessors and suppliers, the Company may nonetheless need to initiate a Chapter 11
filing because its financial condition will remain weak and its prospects uncertain. The fragility of the Company's financial condition is further illustrated by the going concern opinion of the
Company's independent auditors (see page 47). Other negative factors include but are not limited to, the failure of the U. S. economy to soon begin a recovery, a prolonged war in Iraq, another
terrorist attack, the failure of the Company to satisfy the liquidity requirement in certain of its credit agreements, or the inability of the Company to access the capital markets for additional
financing.

During
2001 and 2002, the Company raised approximately $8.3 billion of funding to finance capital commitments and to fund operating losses. The Company expects that it will
continue to need to raise significant additional financing in the near future to cover its liquidity needs, until such time as the cost initiatives discussed in the previous paragraphs become
effective and the Company returns to profitability. The Company had approximately $2.0 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2002. The
Company also had available possible future financing sources, including, but not limited to: (i) a limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt (as of December 31, 2002, the
Company had Section 1110 eligible unencumbered aircraft with an estimated market value of approximately $670 million), (ii) sale-leaseback transactions of owned
property, including aircraft and real estate, (iii) securitization of future operating receipts, and (iv) the potential sale of certain non-core assets (including the
Company's interests in AMR Investments, as discussed in Item 1 and Worldspan, a computer reservations systems partnership). However, these financing sources may not be available to the Company in
light of its financial condition. To the extent that the Company is unable to access capital markets and raise additional capital, the Company will be unable to fund its obligations and sustain its
operations. In such an event, the Company will be forced to initiate a Chapter 11 filing.

On
April 11-12, 2003, the Senate and House agreed to aviation-related assistance provisions in supplemental appropriations legislation to fund the war in Iraq. The legislation is
expected to be signed by President Bush on April 14, 2003. The new law would authorize payment of (i) $100 million to compensate air carriers for the direct costs associated with
the strengthening of flight deck doors and locks and (ii) $2.3 billion to reimburse air carriers for increased security costs which shall be distributed in proportion to amounts each has
paid or collected as of the date of enactment in passenger security and air carrier security fees to the Transportation Security Administration. In addition, the new law would suspend the collection
of the passenger security fee from June 1, 2003 until October 1, 2003, and extend war-risk insurance through September 30, 2004. The Company is not able to estimate its portion of
this compensation at this time.

In
the first quarter of 2003, as a result of the Company's declining financial condition, the Company has made approximately $500 million in fuel prepayments, tax escrow deposits
and credit card holdback deposits.


AMR
and American's credit ratings are significantly below investment grade. In June 2002, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit ratings of AMR and American, and the
credit ratings of a number of other major airlines. The long-term credit ratings of AMR and American were removed from Standard & Poor's CreditWatch with negative implications and
were given a negative outlook. In September 2002, Moody's downgraded the unsecured credit ratings of both AMR and American and maintained a negative outlook on these ratings. In
January 2003, Standard & Poor's and Moody's placed the credit ratings of AMR and American on review for downgrade. In February 2003, Moody's further downgraded the senior implied
rating for AMR, the senior unsecured ratings of both AMR and American and the ratings of most of American's secured debt. The Moody's ratings remain on review for possible downgrade. Also in
February 2003, Standard & Poor's lowered its long-term corporate credit ratings for both AMR and American, lowered the senior secured and unsecured debt ratings of AMR, and
lowered the secured debt rating of American. American's short-term rating was withdrawn. Ratings on most of American's non-enhanced equipment trust certificates were also
lowered. In addition, Standard & Poor's revised the CreditWatch implications to developing from negative. In March 2003, Standard & Poor's further lowered its
long-term corporate credit ratings for both AMR and American, lowered the senior secured and unsecured debt ratings of AMR, and lowered the secured debt rating of American. Ratings on most
of American's non-enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered. These reductions have increased the Company's borrowing costs. Additional significant reductions in AMR's or
American's credit ratings would further increase its borrowing or other
costs and further restrict the availability of future financing. Also in March 2003, Standard & Poor's removed AMR's common stock from the S&P 500 index.

American
has a fully drawn $834 million credit facility that expires December 15, 2005. On March 31, 2003, American and certain lenders in such facility entered into
a waiver and amendment that (i) waived, until May 15, 2003, the requirement that American pledge additional collateral to the extent the value of the existing collateral was insufficient
under the terms of the facility, (ii) waived American's liquidity covenant for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, and (iii) modified the financial covenants applicable to
subsequent periods and increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility. On May 15, 2003, American expects to be required to pledge an additional 30
(non-Section 1110 eligible) aircraft having an aggregate net book value as of March 31, 2003 of approximately $451 million. Pursuant to the modified financial
covenants, American is required to maintain at least $1.0 billion of liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash and short-term investments for the second quarter 2003 and beyond. At
this point, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to satisfy this liquidity requirement.

In
addition, the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges has been decreased until the period ending December 31, 2004, and the next test of such cash flow coverage ratio will
not occur until March 31, 2004. The amendment also provided for a 50 basis points increase in the applicable margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), resulting in an effective
interest rate (as of March 31, 2003) of 4.73 percent. The interest rate will be reset again on September 17, 2003. At American's option, interest on the facility can be calculated
on one of several different bases. For most borrowings, American would anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR.

The
Company had $783 million in restricted cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2002. These restricted assets relate primarily to collateral held
to support standby letters of credit backing floating rate tax-exempt bonds, projected workers' compensation obligations and various other obligations. As of December 31, 2002, the
collateral required to support the standby letters of credit backing the floating rate tax-exempt bonds exceeded the face value of the bonds. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company
redeemed all $339 million of tax-exempt bonds that were backed by standby letters of credit secured by restricted cash and short-term investments. The redemption of
these bonds resulted in an increase in the Company's unrestricted cash and short-term investments balances in 2003. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information regarding restricted cash and short-term investments.

Net
cash used by operating activities in 2002 was $1.1 billion, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $542 million and $3.1 billion in 2001 and
2000, respectively. The $1.7 billion decrease from 2001 to 2002 resulted primarily from an increase in the Company's net loss. Included in net cash used by operating activities of 2002 was
approximately $658 million received by the Company as a result of the utilization of its 2001 NOL's.


Capital
expenditures in 2002 totaled $1.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion in 2001 and $3.7 billion in 2000. In 2002, American took delivery of three Boeing
777-200ERs and seven Boeing 757-200s. AMR Eagle took delivery of 28 Embraer 140s and seven Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft. These expenditures were financed primarily
through secured mortgage and debt agreements. Proceeds from the sale of equipment and property and other investments totaled $220 million, including the proceeds received upon the delivery of
three McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft to FedEx.

On
April 9, 2001, TWA LLC purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of TWA for approximately $742 million, which was funded from the
Company's existing cash and short-term investments.

During
2002, American issued $617 million of enhanced equipment trust certificates secured by aircraft, with interest based on LIBOR plus a spread (0.62 percent) and
maturities over various periods, with a final maturity in 2007. These obligations are insured by a third party. A $1 billion credit facility, established in late 2001 to serve as an immediate
alternative for this financing, expired undrawn on September 30, 2002. Also during 2002, the Company entered into approximately $1.7 billion of various debt agreements secured by
aircraft. Effective rates on these agreements are fixed or variable based on LIBOR plus a spread and mature over various periods of time through 2017. At December 31, 2002, the effective
interest rates on these debt agreements and the enhanced equipment trust certificates described above ranged up to 5.94 percent.

In
2002, the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation and the New York City Industrial Development Agency issued facilities sublease revenue bonds at the Los Angeles International
Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport, respectively, to provide reimbursement to American for certain facility construction and other related costs. The Company has recorded the total
amount of the issuances of $759 million (net of $38 million discount) as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. These obligations
bear interest at fixed rates, with an average effective rate of 8.54 percent, and mature over various periods of time, with a final maturity in 2028. The Company has received approximately
$672 million in reimbursements of certain facility construction and other related costs through December 31, 2002. Of the remaining $87 million of bond issuance proceeds not yet
received, classified as Other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, $40 million are held by the trustee for reimbursement of future facility construction costs and will be available to the
Company in the future, and $47 million are held in a debt service reserve fund.

As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft: two Boeing 777-200 ERs, nine Boeing 767-300ERs, 22 Embraer regional
jets and 10 Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2003; an aggregate of 74 Embraer regional jets and seven Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2004 through 2006; and an aggregate of 47 Boeing
737-800s and nine Boeing 777-200ERs in 2006 through 2010. Future payments for all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate
$1.0 billion in 2003, $753 million in 2004, $694 million in 2005 and an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion in 2006 through 2010. These commitments and cash flows
reflect agreements the Company entered into with Boeing in November 2002 to defer 34 of its 2003 through 2005 deliveries to 2007 and beyond. In addition to these deferrals, Boeing Capital
Corporation has agreed to provide backstop financing for all Boeing aircraft deliveries in 2003. In return, American has agreed to grant Boeing a security interest in certain advance payments
previously made and in certain rights under the aircraft purchase agreement between American and Boeing. In addition, the Company has pre-arranged financing or backstop financing for all
of its 2003 Embraer and Bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portion of its post 2003 deliveries. As a result, substantially all of the aircraft spending in 2003 is supported by committed financing.

In
addition to these commitments for aircraft, the Company expects to spend approximately $400 million in 2003 for modifications to aircraft, renovations of—and
additions to—airport and off-airport facilities, and the acquisition of various other equipment and assets.


The
Company has contracted with two regional airlines, Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines, Inc. (collectively the AmericanConnection carriers)
to provide Embraer EMB-140/145 regional jet services under the brand "AmericanConnection". Under these arrangements, the Company pays the AmericanConnection carriers a fixed fee per block
hour to operate the aircraft. The block hour fees are designed to cover the AmericanConnection carriers' fully allocated costs. Assumptions for highly volatile or uncontrollable costs such as fuel,
landing fees, insurance, and aircraft ownership are trued up to actual values on a pass through basis. In addition to covering the cost of operations, the Company also pays a designed profit margin to
the AmericanConnection carriers. In consideration for these payments, the Company retains all passenger and other revenues resulting from the operation of the AmericanConnection regional jets. Minimum
payments under the contracts are $124 million in 2003, $69 million in 2004, $70 million in 2005 and $64 million in 2006. However, based on expected utilization, the Company
expects to make payments of $164 million in 2003, $191 million in 2004, $192 million in 2005, $194 million in 2006 and $195 million in 2007. In addition, if the
Company terminates the Chautauqua contract without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its Embraer aircraft to the Company. If the Company were to terminate the Chautauqua contract without cause
and Chautauqua were to exercise its put rights, the Company would take possession of the aircraft and become liable for lease obligations totaling approximately $21 million per year with lease
expirations in 2018 and 2019.

The
lessors under two of the Company's aircraft leases have exercised options that require the Company to purchase the related aircraft. Under the terms of the exercised put options, on
or about May 27, 2003, the Company will be required to pay approximately $19 million to purchase the two aircraft subject to such leases.

The
Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. The Company has not
recorded a liability for any of these indemnities, as the likelihood of payment in each case is considered remote. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs.

The
Company's loan agreements and other LIBOR-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate the Company to reimburse the applicable lender
for incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with, or credit extended by such lender related to
the loan, (ii) any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy requirements. In addition, the Company's loan agreements,
derivative transactions and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing
party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law.

These
increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts the Company
could be obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default, and, in a secured financing transaction, would
entitle the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due.

The
Company has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real estate leases where the Company as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities
related to the Company's use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
indemnified parties. In addition, the Company provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to the Company's use of the leased property.

In
certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans and derivative transactions, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the
transaction based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, the Company may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant
transaction.


In
addition, in its aircraft financing agreements, the Company generally indemnifies the financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other related parties against liabilities
(including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the
negligence of the indemnified parties.

The
Company is not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities discussed above.

Under
certain contracts with third parties, the Company indemnifies the third party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third party, or certain other parties. The
terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. Generally, the Company has liability insurance protecting the Company for its obligations it has
undertaken under these indemnities.

The
following table summarizes the Company's obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2002, to be paid in 2003 through 2007 (in millions):

Substantially
all of the 2003 commitment is supported by committed financing.


Includes
expected payments based on projected volumes rather than minimum required payments.


Excludes
related interest amounts.


Includes
noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily information technology support.

In
addition to the commitments summarized above, the Company is required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. These contributions are required under the minimum
funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Pension Plan Income Security Act (ERISA). However, due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required
contributions, such as pension plan benefit levels, interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of future required
contributions beyond 2003. The Company's 2003 minimum required pension contributions are approximately $186 million.

AMR
(principally American) historically operates with a working capital deficit as do most other airline companies. In addition, the Company has historically relied heavily on external
financing to fund capital expenditures. More recently, the Company has also relied on external financing to fund operating losses.

As
stated earlier, in the event the Company is unable to access sources of external financings, the Company will be unable to sustain it operations and will be forced to initiate a
Chapter 11 filing.


Other Information

Environmental Matters

Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potential liability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and
certain airport locations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential liability is joint and several. AMR's alleged volumetric contributions at these sites are minimal compared to
others. AMR does not expect these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additional information is included in
Part D of Item 1 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company believes its
estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following critical
accounting policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of the Company's financial statements: accounting for long-lived assets, passenger revenue, frequent flyer program,
pensions and other postretirement benefits, and income taxes.

Long-lived assets

—The Company has approximately $20 billion of long-lived assets as of December 31,
2002, including approximately $19 billion related to flight equipment and other fixed assets. In addition to the original cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of
policy elections made by the Company, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and in 2002 and 2001, impairment charges. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in
operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. In this circumstance, the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the
net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair market value. In making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair
market value of the assets, and (ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service
the asset will be used in the Company's operations and estimated salvage values. Estimates regarding future length of service are most likely to affect the amount of the impairment charge. During
2001, the Company determined its Fokker 100, Saab 340 and ATR 42 aircraft and related rotables were impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately $1.1 billion. In addition, during
2002, upon decisions to reduce the future service lives of these fleets, the Company determined its Fokker 100, Saab 340, and ATR 42 aircraft and related rotables were further impaired and recorded an
asset impairment charge of approximately $330 million. See Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to each of the policies and assumptions
used by the Company which affect the recorded values of long-lived assets.

Passenger revenue—

Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales
is recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors, including the industry's pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are
recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of
historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company's historical experience. Due to changes in the Company's ticket
refund policy and changes in the profile of customers, historical trends may not be representative of future results.

Frequent flyer program—

The Company uses a number of estimates in accounting for its AAdvantage frequent flyer program. Additional
information regarding the Company's AAdvantage frequent flyer program is included in Part G of Item 1 of this Report. Changes to the percentage of the amount of revenue deferred, deferred
recognition period, cost per mile estimates or the minimum award level accrued could have a significant impact on the Company's revenues or incremental cost accrual in the year of the change as well
as in future years.


Pensions and other postretirement benefits—

The Company's pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using
various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". The Company uses certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate, (ii) expected
return on plan assets, and (iii) expected health care cost trend rate. The discount rate assumption is based upon the review of high quality corporate bond rates, the change in these rates
during the year, and year-end rate levels. The expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate are based upon an evaluation of the Company's historical trends and experience
taking into account current and expected market conditions.

As
of December 31, 2002, the Company's pension discount rate was 6.75 percent, down from 7.50 percent as of December 31, 2001. The Company lowered its
expected return on plan assets to 9 percent, effective as of January 1, 2003, compared with a rate of 9.25 percent and 9.50 percent for 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company's expected health care costs trend rate was six percent in 2003, decreasing gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5 percent by 2005 for pre-65
individuals and twelve percent in 2003, decreasing gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5 percent by 2010 for post-65 individuals. The previously assumed
health care cost trend rate was six percent in 2002, decreasing gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5 percent by 2004.

The
expected return on plan assets component of the Company's net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets. The Company's target asset allocation is
40 percent longer duration corporate bonds, 25 percent U.S. value stocks, 20 percent international stocks, five percent emerging markets stocks and bonds and 10 percent
alternative (private) investments. The Company monitors its actual asset allocation to ensure that it approximates its target allocation and believes that its long-term asset allocation
will continue to approximate its target allocation. The Company's historical ten-year rate of return on plan assets, calculated using a geometric compounding of monthly returns, is
approximately 10.5 percent.

The
Company has an unrecognized net actuarial loss as, of December 31, 2002, of approximately $2.7 billion. The unrecognized net actuarial loss represents changes in the
amount of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets resulting from changes in assumptions and actual experience differing from assumptions. The amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss
component of the Company's 2003 net periodic benefit cost is expected to be approximately $130 million.

The
Company records an additional minimum pension liability when its accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the pension plans' assets in excess of amounts previously accrued for pension
costs. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has recorded an additional minimum pension liability which resulted in a 2002 before tax charge to stockholders' equity of approximately
$1.1 billion. An additional minimum pension liability is recorded as an increase to the pension liability, an increase to other assets (to the extent that a plan has unrecognized prior service
costs) and a charge to stockholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive loss. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company's
pension and other postretirement benefits.

Income Taxes—

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes". Accordingly, the Company records a deferred tax asset valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company
considers its historical earnings, trends, and outlook for future years in determining whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax asset will not be realized. Although the Company was
able to record a tax benefit for losses incurred in 2002, primarily to offset previously recorded deferred tax liabilities, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion
of its deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002 will not be realized. As a result, the Company has a deferred tax asset valuation allowance as of December 31, 2002 of
$370 million, which resulted primarily from deferred tax assets recorded related to the Company's minimum pension liability, and as a result was established based on a charge directly to
equity. However, in future periods, to the extent the Company experiences losses, the effect of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be to offset any tax benefit of such losses.


New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. Prior to SFAS 146, a liability for costs
associated with an exit or disposal activity was recognized as of the date of the commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective
for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 will affect the timing and recognition of certain costs associated with future exit
or disposal activities.

In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (Interpretation 45). Interpretation 45 requires disclosures in interim and annual financial statements about
obligations under certain guarantees issued by the Company. Furthermore, it requires recognition at the beginning of a guarantee of a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee, with limited exceptions. The disclosure requirements are effective for this filing and are included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions are only applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.

In
January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
(Interpretation 46). Interpretation 46 addresses consolidation of variable interest entities, as defined, previously generally referred to as special purpose entities, to which the usual condition for
consolidation described in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" does not apply. It requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to include
the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the variable interest entity in its consolidated financial statements, as well as disclosure of information about the assets and liabilities,
and the nature, purpose and activities of consolidated variable interest entities. In addition, Interpretation 46 requires disclosure of information about the nature, purpose and activities of
unconsolidated variable interest entities in which the Company holds a significant variable interest. The provisions of Interpretation 46 are effective immediately for any variable interest entities
acquired after January 31, 2003 and effective beginning in the third quarter of 2003 for all variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of Interpretation 46.

In
June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" (SFAS 145). SFAS 145 rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt"
(SFAS 4), an amendment of that Statement, FASB Statement No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements" and FASB Statement No. 44,
"Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers". SFAS 145 amends FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases" (SFAS 13), to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback
transactions and other related pronouncements that make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of SFAS 145
related to the rescission of SFAS 4 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior
periods that does not meet the criteria in FASB Opinion 30 for classification as an extraordinary item must be reclassified. The provisions of SFAS 145 related to SFAS 13 are effective
for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. All other provisions SFAS 145 are effective for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002. SFAS 145 had no impact
on the Company during 2002.


Forward-Looking Information

The preceding discussions under Business, Properties, Legal Proceedings and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, which represent the Company's expectations or beliefs concerning future events. When used in this document and in documents incorporated herein by reference, the words "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the Company's expectations concerning
operations and financial conditions, including changes in capacity, revenues and costs, expectations as to future financing needs, overall economic conditions and plans and objectives for future
operations, the impact of the events of September 11, 2001 and the impact of the results of operations for the past two years on the Company and the sufficiency of the Company's financial
resources to absorb that impact. Other forward-looking statements include statements which do not relate solely to historical facts, such as, without limitation, statements which discuss the possible
future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking
statements in this report are based upon information available to the Company on the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
our expectations. The following risk factors, in addition to other possible risk factors not listed, could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
forward-looking statements:

Labor Cost Reduction; Uncertainty of Future Collective Bargaining Agreements and Events

The future of the Company cannot be assured until,
among other things, ways are found to significantly reduce its labor and other costs. As discussed more fully in Part A of Item 1 ("Labor Agreements"), the Company reached agreements with the
leaders of the three major unions representing American employees (the Labor Agreements) and announced changes in pay plans and benefits for non-unionized employees (including officers and
other management) which will significantly reduce its labor costs. Although these Labor Agreements enabled the Company to avoid an immediate filing of a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code (a Chapter 11 filing), these Labor Agreements must still be ratified by the unions' memberships. At the time of the filing of this Form 10-K, the unions have
put the Labor Agreements out for a ratification vote. It is anticipated that the official results of the voting will be formally announced on April 15, 2003. A group of pilots filed a lawsuit
on April 14, 2003 contesting the union ratification process. The U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas denied the request for a temporary restraining order. Failure of one or more of the
unions to ratify its Labor Agreement would likely lead the Company to initiate a Chapter 11 filing. See Part A of Item 1 for a discussion of other factors that may adversely affect the
Company.

Economic and Other Conditions

The airline industry is affected by changes in international, national, regional and local economic
conditions, inflation, war or political instability (or the threat thereof), consumer preferences and spending patterns, demographic trends, disruptions to the air traffic control system, consumer
perceptions of airline safety, costs of safety, security and environmental measures, and the weather.

Fuel Prices/Supply

Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, the Company is unlikely to be able to pass on any increased fuel
prices to its customers by increasing fares. Moreover, to the extent there was a reduction in the supply of jet fuel, the Company's operations could be adversely impacted.


Competition in the Airline Industry

Service over almost all of the Company's routes is highly competitive. The Company faces vigorous
competition from major domestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers, low-cost air carriers, and, particularly on shorter
segments, ground transportation. Increasingly the Company faces significant competition from marketing/operational alliances formed by its competitors. To the extent those alliances can undertake
activities that are not available to the Company, the Company's ability to effectively compete could be hindered. Pricing decisions are affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discounting by
competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company's financial results because the Company is generally required to match competitors' fares to maintain passenger traffic. No assurance
can be given that any future fare reduction would be offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction in costs or changes in the mix of traffic that would improve yields. In addition, since
September 11, 2001 several air carriers have sought to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including United and US Airways. Successful completion of such
reorganizations has resulted or would result in significantly lower operating costs derived from labor, supply, and financing contracts renegotiated under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code.
Historically, air carriers involved in reorganizations have undertaken substantial fare discounting in order to maintain cash flows and enhance customer loyalty.

Changing Business Strategy

The Company may change its business strategy in the future and may not pursue some of the goals stated herein.

Government Regulation

Future results of the Company's operations may vary based upon any actions which the governmental agencies with
jurisdiction over the Company's operations may take, including the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed for codesharing alliances and
other arrangements with other airlines, restrictions on competitive practices (e.g., court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline's ability to respond to a competitor),
the adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (e.g., new passenger security standards), and the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.

Military Involvement

Prior to the war in Iraq, the increased threat of U.S. military involvement in overseas operations had a significant
adverse impact on the Company's business, financial position (including access to capital markets) and results of operations and on the airline industry in general. Furthermore, since its beginning,
the war in Iraq has had a significant adverse impact on international and domestic revenues and future bookings. This adverse impact is expected to continue for the duration of the war and for an
uknown period of time thereafter; however, the Company cannot reasonably predict the extent of such impact.

Adverse Impact of Terrorist Attacks

As described elsewhere in this Report, the events of September 11, 2001 had a material adverse
impact on the Company. Among the effects experienced by the Company from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were significant flight disruption costs caused by the FAA's imposed grounding
of the U.S. airline industry's fleet, significantly increased security and other costs, a reduction in the availability of insurance coverage by insurance carriers, reduced load factors, and
significantly reduced yields. The occurrence of another terrorist attack (whether domestic or international and whether against the Company or another entity) would again have a material adverse
impact on the Company, its finances and/or its operations by further aggravating the aforementioned effects.

Uncertainty in International Operations

The Company's current international activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors
such as reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls, currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international government regulation of the Company's operations.

SARS

In 2003, there has been an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). At the time of this 10-K filing, the
outbreak has been largely concentrated in Asia, although cases have been confirmed in, among other locations, the United States and Canada. At this time SARS would primarily have an adverse impact on
the Company's Pacific operations; however, the significant spread of SARS beyond Asia could have an adverse impact on all of the Company's operations.


Availability of Future Financing

In the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001, the Company raised substantial amounts of
money to finance capital commitments and day-to-day operations. Although the Company has a limited amount of unencumbered assets (for example, as of December 31, 2002,
the Company had Section 1110 eligible unencumbered aircraft with a market value of approximately $670 million) its ability to use those assets for financing activities is uncertain and
these assets may not maintain their current market value. Thus, the Company's current access to capital markets is extremely limited. As noted elsewhere in this Report, credit ratings for the
Company's debt instruments have been downgraded significantly below investment grade and remain on review for a further downgrade. These reductions have increased the Company's borrowing costs. To the
extent the Company's credit ratings are further downgraded, the ability of the Company to access capital markets would be restricted further and/or the Company would have increased financing costs. To
the extent that the Company is unable to access the capital markets for long-term capital spending requirements or short-term liquidity needs, the Company will be unable to
fund its obligations and sustain its operations and will be forced to initiate a Chapter 11 filing.


ITEM 7(A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions

The risk inherent in the Company's market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel,
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity,
nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the Company's exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements
for accounting policies and additional information.

Aircraft Fuel

The Company's earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. In order to provide a measure
of control over price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight operations. The Company also manages the price risk of fuel costs
primarily by using jet fuel, heating oil, and crude swap and option contracts. Market risk is
estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the December 31, 2002 and 2001 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected 2003 fuel usage, such an increase would result in an
increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $205 million in 2003, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2002, and assumes the Company's fuel hedging program
remains effective under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". Comparatively, based on projected 2002 fuel usage,
such an increase would have resulted in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $169 million in 2002, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2001. The
change in market risk is due primarily to the increase in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had hedged approximately 32 percent of its estimated 2003 fuel requirements,
approximately 15 percent of its estimated 2004 fuel requirements, and approximately four percent of its estimated 2005 fuel requirements, compared to approximately 40 percent of its
estimated 2002 fuel requirements, 21 percent of its estimated 2003 fuel requirements, and approximately five percent of its estimated 2004 fuel requirements hedged at December 31, 2001.
The Company's credit rating has limited its ability to enter into certain types of fuel hedge contracts. A further deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position may negatively affect the
Company's ability to hedge fuel in the future.

Foreign Currency

The Company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign
currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. The Company's largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American currencies.
Previously, the Company used options to hedge a portion of its anticipated foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. After determining its foreign currency hedge program's impact was no longer
materially beneficial, the Company discontinued entering into foreign currency hedges. The Company plans to periodically evaluate its foreign currency hedge position to determine whether its foreign
currency hedge program should be reinstated. The result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2002 and 2001 levels relative to each of
the currencies in which the Company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $65 million and $40 million for the years ending
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, net of hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2001, due to the Company's foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its foreign-denominated
expenses. This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2003 and 2002 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.


Interest

The Company's earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income
from cash and short-term investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments. The Company's largest exposure with respect to variable-rate
debt comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company has variable-rate debt instruments representing approximately 43 percent and 35 percent of
its total long-term debt at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and interest rate swaps on notional amounts of approximately $138 million and $148 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2002 and 2001. If the Company's interest rates average 10 percent more in 2003 than they did at December 31, 2002, the Company's interest expense
would increase by approximately $15 million and interest income from cash and short-term investments would increase by approximately $5 million. In comparison, at
December 31, 2001, the Company estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in 2002 than they did at December 31, 2001, the Company's interest expense would have
increased by approximately $10 million and interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased by approximately $9 million. These amounts are determined
by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the Company's variable-rate long-term debt, interest rate swap agreements, and cash and short-term
investment balances at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Market
risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in
interest rates, and amounts to approximately $395 million and $318 million
as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The change in market risk is due primarily to the increase in the Company's fixed-rate long-term debt during 2002. The
fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Company's incremental borrowing rates for similar types
of borrowing arrangements.

Other

In addition, the Company holds investments in certain other entities which are subject to market risk. However, the impact of such
market risk on earnings is not significant due to the immateriality of the carrying value and the geographically diverse nature of these holdings.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

AMR Corporation

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMR Corporation as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AMR Corporation at December 31, 2002
and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Company's recent history of
significant losses, negative cash flows from operations, uncertainty regarding the Company's ability to reduce it's operating costs to offset the declines in its revenues, the potential failure of the
Company to satisfy the liquidity requirements in certain of its credit agreements, and its diminishing financial resources, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

As
discussed in Note 4 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for its goodwill
and other intangible assets as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and effective January 1, 2001 the
Company changed its method of accounting for its derivative and hedging activities as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities," as amended.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, including its principal subsidiary American Airlines, Inc. (American). On April 9, 2001, American (through a wholly owned subsidiary, TWA Airlines LLC (TWA LLC))
purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA). Accordingly, the operating results of TWA LLC since the date of acquisition have
been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations, cash flows and net assets for Sabre
Holdings Corporation (Sabre) for 2000 have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, the information in the footnotes
relates to the continuing operations of AMR. Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with the 2002 presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments

The Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related
primarily to collateral held to support standby letters of credit backing floating rate tax exempt bonds, projected workers' compensation obligations and various other obligations.

Inventories

Spare parts, materials and supplies relating to flight equipment are carried at average acquisition cost and are expensed when
incurred in operations. Allowances for obsolescence are provided—over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines—for spare parts expected to be on hand at
the date
aircraft are retired from service, plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as excess. These allowances are based on management estimates, which are subject to change.

Equipment and Property

The provision for depreciation of operating equipment and property is computed on the straight-line
method applied to each unit of property, except that major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are depreciated on a group basis. The depreciable lives used for the principal depreciable asset
classifications are:

Depreciable Life

Fokker 100 aircraft



ATR 42 aircraft



Saab 340 aircraft



Other American jet aircraft and engines

20-30 years

Other regional aircraft and engines

16-20 years

Major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies

Life of equipment to which applicable

Improvements to leased flight equipment

Term of lease

Buildings and improvements (principally on leased land)

10-30 years or term of lease

Furniture, fixtures and other equipment

3-10 years

Capitalized software

3-10 years


Approximate
final aircraft retirement date.


1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)

Residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are generally five to 10 percent, except when a guaranteed residual
value or other agreements exist to better estimate the residual value.

Equipment
and property under capital leases are amortized over the term of the leases or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their expected useful lives, and such amortization is
included in depreciation and amortization. Lease terms vary but are generally 10 to 25 years for aircraft and seven to 40 years for other leased equipment and property.

Maintenance and Repair Costs

Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as
incurred, except engine overhaul costs incurred by AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle) and costs incurred for maintenance and repair under power by the hour maintenance contract agreements,
which are accrued on the basis of hours flown.

Intangible Assets

Route acquisition costs and airport operating and gate lease rights represent the purchase price attributable to route
authorities (including international airport take-off and landing slots), airport take-off and landing slots and airport gate leasehold rights acquired. Indefinite-lived
intangible assets (route acquisition costs) are tested for impairment annually on December 31, rather than amortized, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142). Airport operating and gate lease rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years to a
zero residual value.

Passenger Revenue

Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales
is recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors, including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized
in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical
trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company's historical experience.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was $161 million,
$202 million and $221 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Frequent Flyer Program

The estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is accrued when such award levels are reached.
American sells mileage credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent flyer program. The portion of the revenue related to the sale of mileage credits, representing the
revenue for air transportation sold, is valued at current market rates and is deferred over 28 months, which approximates the expected period over which the mileage credits are used. The
remaining portion of the revenue, representing the marketing products sold and administrative costs associated with operating the AAdvantage program, is recognized upon sale as the related services
have been provided.

Statements of Cash Flows

Short-term investments, without regard to remaining maturity at acquisition, are not considered as
cash equivalents for purposes of the statements of cash flows.

Measurement of Asset Impairments

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances
indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. The impairment charge is
determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair market value. In making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not
limited to: (i) estimated fair market value of the assets, and (ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such
as asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used in the Company's operations and estimated salvage values.


1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)

Employee Accruals

The Company estimates the amount of potential retroactive pay expected to be provided upon finalization of a labor
agreement for work groups working under contracts that have become amendable. These estimates are based upon management's expectation of the most likely outcome of the contract negotiations.

Stock Options

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Under APB 25, no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants if the exercise price
of the Company's stock option grants is at or above the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company has adopted the pro forma disclosure features of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure". As required by SFAS 123, pro forma information regarding income (loss) from continuing operations before extraordinary loss and cumulative
effect of accounting change and earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations before extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of accounting change have been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options and awards granted subsequent to December 31, 1994 using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123. The fair value for the stock options was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2002, 2001 and 2000: risk-free interest rates ranging from
4.30% to 6.15%; dividend yields of 0%; expected stock volatility ranging from 43.5% to 45.2%; and expected life of the options of 4.5 years and 1.5 years.

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options,
and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its employee stock options.

The
following table illustrates the effect on net earnings (loss) and earnings per share amounts if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to
stock-based employee compensation (in millions, except per share amounts):

1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. Prior to SFAS 146, a liability for costs
associated with an exit or disposal activity was recognized as of the date of the commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 will affect the timing and recognition of certain costs associated with future exit or disposal activities.

In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (Interpretation 45). Interpretation 45 requires disclosures in interim and annual financial statements about
obligations under certain guarantees issued by the Company. Furthermore, it requires recognition at the beginning of a guarantee of a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee, with limited exceptions including: 1) a parent's guarantee of a subsidiary's debt to a third party, and 2) a subsidiary's guarantee of the debt owed to a third
party by either its parent or another subsidiary of that parent. The disclosure requirements are effective for this filing and are included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are only applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.

In
January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
(Interpretation 46). Interpretation 46 addresses consolidation of variable interest entities, as defined, previously generally referred to as special purpose entities, to which the usual condition for
consolidation described in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" does not apply. It requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to include
the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the variable interest entity in its consolidated financial statements, as well as disclosure of information about the assets and liabilities,
and the nature, purpose and activities of consolidated variable interest entities. In addition, Interpretation 46 requires disclosure of information about the nature, purpose and activities of
unconsolidated variable interest entities in which the Company holds a significant variable interest. The provisions of Interpretation 46 are effective immediately for any variable interest entities
acquired after January 31, 2003 and effective beginning in the third quarter of 2003 for all variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of Interpretation 46.

In
June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" (SFAS 145). SFAS 145 rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt"
(SFAS 4), and an amendment of that Statement, FASB Statement No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements" and FASB Statement No. 44,
"Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers". SFAS 145 amends FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases" (SFAS 13), to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback
transactions and other related pronouncements that make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of
SFAS 145 related to the rescission of SFAS 4 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an
extraordinary item in prior periods that does not meet the criteria in FASB Opinion 30 for classification as an extraordinary item must be reclassified. The provisions of SFAS 145 related to
SFAS 13 are effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. All other provisions SFAS 145 are effective for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002.
SFAS 145 had no impact on the Company during 2002.

The Company's recent financial results are unsustainable. Given the severity of the Company's financial situation and the Company's belief that a permanent shift
has occurred in the airline revenue environment, the Company continues to review its business model, particularly with a view towards identifying significant cost reductions. The Company believes that
it must quickly reduce its annual operating costs by at least $4 billion in order to become competitive and sustain its operations. The Company has made progress in identifying more than
$2 billion in annual operating cost reductions via initiatives involving: (i) scheduling efficiencies, including de-peaking certain of its hubs as referred to above,
(ii) fleet simplification, (iii) streamlined customer interaction, (iv) distribution modifications, (v) in-flight product changes, (vi) operational
changes and (vii) headquarters/administration efficiencies. Even with these initiatives, however, a large shortfall of approximately $2 billion remains between identified annual cost
reductions and needed cost reductions.

In
February 2003, American asked its labor leaders and other employees for approximately $1.8 billion in permanent, annual savings through a combination of changes in
wages, benefits and work rules. The requested $1.8 billion in savings is divided by work group as follows: $660 million—pilots, $620 million—Transportation
Workers Union (TWU) represented employees, $340 million—flight attendants, $100 million—management and support staff, and $80 million—agents
and representatives. On March 31, 2003, the Company reached agreements with the leaders of the three major unions representing American employees (the Labor Agreements) and announced changes in
pay plans and benefits for non-unionized employees (including officers and other management) which will meet the targeted contributions. Of the approximately $1.8 billion in
savings, approximately $1.0 billion are to be accomplished through wage and benefit reductions while the remaining approximately $.8 billion would be accomplished through changes in work
rules which would result in additional job reductions. Wage reductions became effective on April 1, 2003 for officers and will become effective on May 1, 2003 for all other employees.
Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes will be phased in over time. In connection with the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, the Labor Agreements provide for the issuance of
approximately 38 million shares of AMR stock in the form of stock options which will generally vest over a three year period (see Note 11 for additional information). Although these
Labor Agreements enabled the Company to avoid an immediate filing of a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (a Chapter 11 filing), these Labor Agreements must still be
ratified by the unions' memberships. At the time of the filing of this Form 10-K, the unions have put the Labor Agreements out for a ratification vote. It is anticipated that the
official results of the voting will be formally announced on April 15, 2003. A group of pilots filed a lawsuit on April 14, 2003 contesting the union ratification process. The U.S.
District Court in Fort Worth, Texas denied the request for a temporary restraining order. Failure of one or more of the unions to ratify its Labor Agreement would likely lead the Company to initiate a
Chapter 11 filing.

In
addition, the Company continues to negotiate concessions from its vendors, lessors and suppliers; however, the Company cannot reliably predict whether it will obtain the necessary
concessions or for what
amount. In return for concessions, the Company plans to deliver shares of AMR common stock to its vendors, lessors and other creditors.

Even
if the Labor Agreements are ratified and the Company obtains concessions from its vendors, lessors and suppliers, the Company may nonetheless need to initiate a Chapter 11
filing because its financial condition will remain weak and its prospects uncertain. Other negative factors include but are not limited to, the failure of the U. S. economy to soon begin a recovery, a
prolonged war in Iraq, another terrorist attack, the failure of the Company to satisfy the liquidity requirement in certain of its credit agreements (see Note 8), or the inability of the
Company to access the capital markets for additional financing.


3. Special charges and U.S. Government grant

In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its costs, reduce capacity, simplify its aircraft fleet, and enhance productivity. These
initiatives include, among other things, de-peaking of the Company's Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport hub (following the de-peaking of its Chicago hub); gradually
phasing out operation of its Fokker aircraft fleet; and reducing capacity in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, the Company announced that it would reduce an estimated 7,000 jobs by
March 2003 to realign its workforce with the planned capacity reductions, fleet simplification, and hub restructurings. As a result of these initiatives, the Company recorded special charges in
the third quarter of 2002, as discussed below.

On
September 11, 2001, two American Airlines aircraft were hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in northern
Virginia. On the same day, two United Air Lines aircraft were also hijacked and used in terrorist attacks. In addition to the loss of life on board the aircraft, these attacks resulted in untold
deaths and injuries to persons on the ground and massive property damage. In response to those terrorist attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a federal ground stop order on
September 11, 2001, prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the United States. Airports did not reopen until September 13, 2001 (except for Washington Reagan Airport, which was
partially reopened on October 4, 2001). The Company was able to operate only a portion of its scheduled flights for several days thereafter. When flights were permitted to resume, passenger
traffic and yields on the Company's flights were significantly lower than prior to the attacks. As a result, the Company reduced its operating schedule to approximately 80 percent of the
schedule it flew prior to September 11, 2001. In addition, as a result of its schedule reduction and the sharp fall off in passenger traffic, the Company eliminated approximately 20,000 jobs.

On
September 22, 2001, President Bush signed into law the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Act). Under the airline compensation provisions of the Act,
each U.S. airline and air cargo carrier was entitled to receive the lesser of: (i) its direct and incremental losses for the period September 11, 2001 to December 31, 2001 or
(ii) its proportional available seat mile allocation of $5 billion in compensation available under the Act. The Company received a total of $866 million from the U.S. Government
under the Act. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized approximately $10 million and $856 million, respectively, as compensation under the Act,
which is included in U.S. Government grant on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In
addition, the Act provides for compensation to individual claimants who were physically injured or killed as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
Furthermore, the Act provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims, whether compensatory or punitive, arising from the terrorist-related events of
September 11, 2001 against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability coverage maintained by the air carrier. Based upon estimates provided by the Company's insurance providers, the Company
recorded a liability of approximately $2.3 billion for claims arising from the events of September 11, 2001, after considering the liability protections provided for by the Act. In
addition, the Company recorded a receivable for the same amount which the Company expects to recover from its insurance carriers as claims are resolved. This insurance receivable and liability are
classified as Other assets and Other liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, respectively, and are based on reserves established by the Company's insurance
carriers. These estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available concerning the expected claims. One of the Company's insurance carriers has entered rehabilitation, a voluntary
reorganization process. The carrier provides approximately five percent of the Company's coverage related to the events of September 11, 2001 as well as other covered items. This results in
approximately $110 million in receivables, net of reserves, from the insurance carrier as of December 31, 2002. The Company expects to recover the net receivable via the rehabilitation
process or other means available.

Aircraft
charges

In
connection with the series of initiatives announced in 2002 and related revisions to its fleet plan to accelerate the retirement of its owned Fokker 100, Saab 340, and ATR 42
aircraft, the Company determined that these aircraft are impaired under SFAS 144. As a result of this determination, during the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded an asset impairment
charge of approximately $330 million reflecting the diminution in the fair value of these aircraft and related rotables; and a charge of approximately $40 million reflecting the
write-down of certain related inventory to realizable value and the accrual of certain related costs.

Furthermore,
the Company accelerated the retirement of nine operating leased Boeing 767-300 aircraft to the fourth quarter of 2002 (previously scheduled to be retired by
May 2003), and its four operating leased Fokker 100 aircraft to 2004 (previously scheduled to be retired by 2010). As a result, during the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge
of approximately $189 million related primarily to future lease commitments on these aircraft past the dates they will be removed from service, lease return costs, the write-down of
excess Boeing 767-300 related inventory and rotables to realizable value, and the accrual of certain other costs. Cash outlays will occur over the remaining lease terms, which extend
through 2014.

In
addition, as a result of revisions to its fleet plan, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $99 million related primarily to contract cancellation costs and other
costs related to discontinued aircraft modifications.

During
the second quarter of 2001, in conjunction with the acquisition of certain assets from TWA, coupled with revisions to the Company's fleet plan to accelerate the retirement dates
of its owned Fokker 100, Saab 340 and ATR 42 aircraft, the Company determined these aircraft were impaired. As a result, during the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an asset impairment
charge of approximately $685 million relating to the write-down of the carrying value of these aircraft and related rotables to their estimated fair values. Furthermore, during the
third quarter of 2001, following the events of September 11, 2001 and decisions by other carriers to ground their Fokker 100 fleets, the Company determined that its Fokker 100, Saab 340, and
ATR 42 aircraft were further impaired. Therefore, during the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an additional charge of approximately $423 million reflecting the diminution in the
estimated fair value of these aircraft and related rotables.

In
addition, due primarily to fleet plan changes implemented by the Company as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the Company recorded a charge of approximately
$64 million related primarily to the write-down of certain other aircraft and aircraft modifications to their estimated fair value. Included in this charge is the
write-down of five owned Boeing 727-200 non-operating aircraft and one owned McDonnell Douglas MD-80 non-operating aircraft.

The
Company also retired all McDonnell Douglas DC-9 aircraft and eight McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft during the third and fourth quarters of 2001, and
accelerated the retirement of its entire Boeing 717-200 fleet to June 2002 (these aircraft were acquired from TWA). In conjunction therewith, the Company recorded a charge of
approximately $65 million related primarily to future lease commitments and return condition costs on the operating leased aircraft past the dates they will be removed from service. Cash
outlays will occur over the remaining lease terms, which extend through 2010.


3. Special charges and U.S. Government grant (Continued)

In determining the asset impairment charges described above, management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows using models used by the Company in making
fleet and scheduling decisions. In determining the fair value of these aircraft, the Company considered outside third party appraisals and recent transactions involving sales of similar aircraft and
engines. In 2002, the Company also considered internal valuation models in determining the fair value of these aircraft, and with respect to the Fokker 100 aircraft, incorporated the fact that with
this grounding, no major airline will operate this fleet type.

Employee
charges

In
August 2002, the Company announced that it would reduce an estimated 7,000 jobs by March 2003 to realign its workforce with the planned capacity reductions, fleet
simplification, and hub restructurings. This reduction in workforce, which affected all work groups (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, fleet service clerks, agents, management and support staff
personnel), was accomplished through various measures, including limited voluntary programs, leaves of absence, part-time work schedules, furloughs in accordance with collective bargaining
agreements, and permanent layoffs. As a result, during the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded an employee charge of approximately $57 million primarily related to voluntary programs in
accordance with collective bargaining agreements with its pilot and flight attendant work groups. Additional charges related to the reduction in workforce, incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002, were
not significant and are not included in special charges. The Company does not expect remaining charges related to the reduction in workforce to be significant. Cash outlays for the $57 million
employee charge will be incurred over a period of up to twelve months.

In
September 2001, the Company announced that it would reduce its workforce by approximately 20,000 jobs across all work groups (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, fleet
service clerks, agents, management and support staff personnel). The reduction in workforce, which the Company accomplished through various measures, including leaves of absence, job sharing,
elimination of open positions, furloughs in accordance with collective bargaining agreements, and permanent layoffs, resulted from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the Company's
subsequent reduction of its operating schedule by approximately 20 percent. In connection therewith, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $71 million for employee termination
benefits. Cash outlays for the employee charges were incurred substantially during 2001.

Facility
exit costs

During
2001, the Company announced that it would discontinue service at Dallas Love Field and discontinue or reduce service on several of its international routes. In addition, the
Company announced it would close six Admiral's Clubs, five airport Platinum Service Centers and approximately 105 off-airport Travel Centers in 37 cities, all effective
September 28, 2001. As a result of these announcements, the Company recorded an $87 million charge related primarily to future lease commitments and the write-off of
leasehold improvements and fixed assets. Cash outlays related to the accrual of future lease commitments will occur over the remaining lease terms, which extend through 2018.

In
addition, in December 2001, American agreed to sell its terminal facilities lease rights at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport to the Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority. As
a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a $28 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 to accrue the residual cost less sales proceeds. The transaction closed in early 2002.

4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
(SFAS 142). SFAS 142 requires the Company to test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (for AMR, route acquisition costs) for impairment rather than amortize them. During the
first quarter of 2002, the Company completed its impairment analysis for route acquisition costs in accordance with SFAS 142. The analysis did not result in an impairment charge. During the
third quarter of 2002, the Company completed its impairment analysis related to its $1.4 billion of goodwill and determined the Company's entire goodwill balance was impaired. In arriving at
this conclusion, the Company's net book value was determined to be in excess of the Company's fair value at January 1, 2002, using AMR as the reporting unit for purposes of the fair value
determination. The Company determined its fair value as of January 1, 2002, using various valuation methods, ultimately using market capitalization as the primary indicator of fair value. As a
result, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge, effective January 1, 2002, of $988 million ($6.35 per share, net of a tax benefit of
$363 million) to write-off all of AMR's goodwill. The tax benefit of $363 million differed from the amount computed at the statutory federal income tax rate due to a portion
of AMR's goodwill not being deductible for federal tax purposes. The charge to write-off all of AMR's goodwill is nonoperational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of
accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations.

Airport
operating and gate lease rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years to a zero residual value. For the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001, the Company recorded amortization expense of approximately $28 million and $29 million, respectively, related to these intangible assets. The Company expects to record
annual amortization expense of approximately $28 million in each of the next five years related to these intangible assets.

The
pro forma effect of discontinuing amortization of goodwill and route acquisition costs under SFAS 142—assuming the Company had adopted this standard as of
January 1, 2000—results in an adjusted net loss of approximately $1,722 million, or $11.17 per share for the year ended December 31, 2001, and adjusted net income of
approximately $838 million, or $5.59 per share basic and $5.18 per share diluted for the year ended December 31, 2000.

The
Company had route acquisition costs of $829 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

All
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, are

The
Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support standby letters of credit backing floating rate
tax-exempt bonds, projected workers' compensation obligations and various other obligations. As of December 31, 2002, standby letter of credit agreements related to
tax-exempt bonds were secured by restricted short-term investments of $347 million, projected workers' compensation obligations were secured by restricted cash and
short-term investments of $334 million, and various other obligations were secured by restricted cash and short-term investments of $102 million. As of
December 31, 2001, standby letter of credit agreements related to tax-exempt bonds were secured by restricted short-term investments of $422 million, projected
workers' compensation obligations were secured by restricted cash and short-term investments of $81 million, and various other obligations were secured by restricted cash and
short-term investments of $32 million.

In
the first quarter of 2003, as a result of the Company's declining financial condition, the Company has made approximately $500 million in fuel prepayments, tax escrow deposits
and credit card holdback deposits.

During
1999, the Company entered into an agreement with priceline.com Incorporated (priceline) whereby ticket inventory provided by the Company may be sold through priceline's
e-commerce system. In conjunction with this agreement, the Company received warrants to purchase approximately 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock. In the second quarter of
2000, the Company sold these warrants for proceeds of approximately $94 million, and recorded a gain of $57 million which is included in Miscellaneous—net on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

During
2000, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $41 million from the recovery of start-up expenses (previously written-off) from the Canadian
Airlines International Limited services agreement entered into during 1995 which is included in Miscellaneous—net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

6. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft: two Boeing 777-200 ERs, nine Boeing
767-300ERs, 22 Embraer regional jets and 10 Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2003; an aggregate of 74 Embraer regional jets and seven Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2004 through
2006; and an aggregate of 47 Boeing 737-800s and nine Boeing 777-200ERs in 2006 through 2010. Future payments for all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price
escalation, will approximate $1.0 billion in 2003, $753 million in 2004, $694 million in 2005 and an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion in 2006 through 2010. These
commitments and cash flows reflect agreements the Company entered into with Boeing in November 2002 to defer 34 of its 2003 through 2005 deliveries to 2007 and beyond. In addition to these
deferrals, Boeing Capital Corporation has agreed to provide backstop financing for all Boeing aircraft deliveries in 2003. In return, American has agreed to grant Boeing a security interest in certain
advance payments previously made and in certain rights under the aircraft purchase agreement between American and Boeing. In addition, the Company has pre-arranged financing or backstop
financing for all of its 2003 Embraer and Bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portion of its post 2003 deliveries.

In
addition to these commitments for aircraft, the Company expects to spend approximately $400 million in 2003 for modifications to aircraft, renovations of—and
additions to—airport and off-airport facilities, and the acquisition of various other equipment and assets.


6. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued)

The Company has contracted with two regional airlines, Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. and Trans States Airlines, Inc. (collectively the
AmericanConnection carriers) to provide Embraer EMB-140/145 regional jet services under the brand "AmericanConnection". Under these arrangements, the Company pays the AmericanConnection
carriers a fixed fee per block hour to operate the aircraft. The block hour fees are
designed to cover the AmericanConnection carriers' fully allocated costs. Assumptions for highly volatile or uncontrollable costs such as fuel, landing fees, insurance, and aircraft ownership are
trued up to actual values on a pass through basis. In addition to covering the cost of operations, the Company also pays a designed profit margin to the AmericanConnection carriers. In consideration
for these payments, the Company retains all passenger and other revenues resulting from the operation of the AmericanConnection regional jets. Minimum payments under the contracts are
$124 million in 2003, $69 million in 2004, $70 million in 2005 and $64 million in 2006. However, based on expected utilization, the Company expects to make payments of
$164 million in 2003, $191 million in 2004, $192 million in 2005, $194 million in 2006 and $195 million in 2007. In addition, if the Company terminates the
Chautauqua contract without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its Embraer aircraft to the Company. If the Company were to terminate the Chautauqua contract without cause and Chautauqua were to
exercise its put rights, the Company would take possession of the aircraft and become liable for lease obligations totaling approximately $21 million per year with lease expirations in 2018 and
2019.

The
lessors under two of the Company's aircraft leases have exercised options that require the Company to purchase the related aircraft. Under the terms of the exercised put options, on
or about May 27, 2003, the Company will be required to pay approximately $19 million to purchase the two aircraft subject to such leases.

The
Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. The Company has not
recorded a liability for any of these indemnities, as the likelihood of payment in each case is considered remote. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs.

The
Company's loan agreements and other LIBOR-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate the Company to reimburse the applicable lender
for incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with, or credit extended by such lender related to
the loan, (ii) any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy requirements. In addition, the Company's loan agreements,
derivative transactions and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing
party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law.

These
increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts the Company
could be obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default, and, in a secured financing transaction, would
entitle the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due.

The
Company has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real estate leases where the Company as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities
related to the Company's use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, the Company provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to the Company's
use of the leased property.

In
certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans and derivative transactions, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the
transaction based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, the Company may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant
transaction.


6. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued)

In addition, in its aircraft financing agreements, the Company generally indemnifies the financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other related
parties against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities
(or taxes) relate to the negligence of the indemnified parties.

The
Company is not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities discussed above.

Under
certain contracts with third parties, the Company indemnifies the third party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third party, or certain other parties. The
terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. Generally, the Company has liability insurance protecting the Company for its obligations it has
undertaken under these indemnities.

AMR
and American have event risk covenants in approximately $2.1 billion of indebtedness as of December 31, 2002. These covenants permit the holders of such indebtedness to
receive a higher rate of return (between 75 and 650 basis points above the stated rate) if a designated event, as defined, should occur and the credit rating of such indebtedness is downgraded below
certain levels within a certain period of time. No designated event, as defined, has occurred as of December 31, 2002.

Miami-Dade
County is currently investigating and remediating various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs
through landing fees and various cost recovery methods. American and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination at MIA. During the second quarter of
2001, the County filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover its past and future cleanup costs (

Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance
Cargo Services, Inc., et al.

in the Florida Circuit Court). In addition to the 17 defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and
contributors to the contamination. American's and AMR Eagle's portion of the cleanup costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of the remedial actions
that may be required, the proportion of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately supervise
the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. In addition, the Company is subject to environmental issues at various other airport and non-airport locations for which it has
accrued $92 million at December 31, 2002. Management believes, after considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these environmental issues is not expected to
materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on the Company's current assessments of the
ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or decrease as these assessments change.

The
Company is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its operations. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from these claims and litigation would not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


7. Leases

AMR's subsidiaries lease various types of equipment and property, primarily aircraft and airport facilities. The future minimum lease payments required under
capital leases, together with the present value of such payments, and future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease

of December 31, 2002, included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is approximately
$1.7 billion relating to rent expense being recorded in advance of future operating lease payments.

At
December 31, 2002, the Company had 318 jet aircraft and 34 turboprop aircraft under operating leases and 70 jet aircraft and 55 turboprop aircraft under capital
leases—which includes both operating and non-operating aircraft. The aircraft leases can generally be renewed at rates based on fair market value at the end of the lease term
for one to five years. Most aircraft leases have purchase options at or near the end of the lease term at fair market value, but generally not to exceed a stated percentage of the defined lessor's
cost of the aircraft or at a predetermined fixed amount.

Special
facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased by American and accounted for as
operating leases. Approximately $2.4 billion of these bonds (with total future payments of approximately $6 billion as of December 31, 2002) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or
both. These guarantees can only be invoked in the event American defaults on the lease obligation and certain other remedies are not available. Approximately $740 million of these special
facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require American to repurchase the bonds at various times through 2008, including $200 million in November 2003. Although
American has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. In addition, in the first quarter of 2003, the Company redeemed
$253 million of tax-exempt special facility revenue bonds that were backed by standby letters of credit secured by restricted cash and short-term investments. Any
payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would be considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments.

Rent
expense, excluding landing fees, was $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Maturities
of long-term debt (including sinking fund requirements) for the next five years are: 2003—$627 million; 2004—$540 million;
2005—$1.3 billion; 2006—$1.1 billion; 2007—$978 million. In addition, in the first quarter of 2003, the Company redeemed $86 million of
tax-exempt special facility revenue bonds (accounted for as long-term debt) with original maturities in 2014 through 2024 which were backed by standby letters of credit secured
by restricted cash and short-term investments.

American
has a fully drawn $834 million credit facility that expires December 15, 2005. On March 31, 2003, American and certain lenders in such facility entered into
a waiver and amendment that (i) waived, until May 15, 2003, the requirement that American pledge additional collateral to the extent the value of the existing collateral was insufficient
under the terms of the facility, (ii) waived American's liquidity covenant for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, and (iii) modified the financial covenants applicable to
subsequent periods and increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility. On May 15, 2003, American expects to be required to pledge an additional 30
(non-Section 1110 eligible) aircraft having an aggregate net book value as of March 31, 2003 of approximately $451 million. Pursuant to the modified financial
covenants, American is required to maintain at least $1.0 billion of liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash and short-term
investments, for the second quarter 2003 and beyond. At this point, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to satisfy this liquidity requirement.

In
addition, the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges has been decreased until the period ending December 31, 2004, and the next test of such cash flow coverage ratio will
not occur until March 31, 2004. The amendment also provided for a 50 basis points increase in the applicable margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), resulting in an effective
interest rate (as of March 31, 2003) of 4.73 percent. The interest rate will be reset again on September 17, 2003. At American's option, interest on the facility can be calculated
on one of several different bases. For most borrowings, American would anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR.


8. Indebtedness (Continued)

In 2002, the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation and the New York City Industrial Development Agency issued facilities sublease revenue bonds at the Los
Angeles International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport, respectively, to provide reimbursement to American for certain facility construction and other related costs. The Company has
recorded the total amount of the issuances of $759 million (net of $38 million discount) as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002.
These obligations bear interest at fixed rates, with an average effective rate of 8.54 percent, and mature over various periods of time, with a final maturity in 2028. The Company has received
approximately $672 million in reimbursements of certain facility construction and other related costs through December 31, 2002. Of the remaining $87 million of bond issuance
proceeds not yet received, classified as Other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, $40 million are held by the trustee for reimbursement of future facility construction costs and will be
available to the Company in the future, and $47 million are held in a debt service reserve fund.

In
September 2002, American issued $617 million of enhanced equipment trust certificates secured by aircraft, with interest based on LIBOR plus a spread
(.62 percent) and maturities over various periods, with a final maturity in 2007. These obligations are insured by a third party.

In
addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, American and AMR Eagle borrowed approximately $1.7 billion under various debt agreements which are secured by
aircraft. Effective interest rates on these agreements are fixed or variable based on LIBOR plus a spread and they mature over various periods of time through 2017. At December 31, 2002, the
effective interest rates on these debt agreements and the enhanced equipment trust certificates described above ranged up to 5.94 percent.

Certain
debt is secured by aircraft, engines, equipment and other assets having a net book value of approximately $11.1 billion. In addition, certain of American's letter of
credit agreements contain restrictive covenants, including a minimum net worth requirement, which could limit American's ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2002, none of the retained
earnings of American was available for payments of dividends to AMR. Such restrictions will no longer apply if the letters of credit are terminated in connection
with redemption of the underlying bonds. American redeemed all bonds with letters of credit subject to the restrictions in the first quarter of 2003.

As
of December 31, 2002, AMR has issued guarantees covering approximately $935 million of American's tax-exempt bond debt and American has issued guarantees
covering approximately $636 million of AMR's unsecured debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, AMR and American have issued guarantees covering approximately $538 million of
AMR Eagle's secured debt.

Cash
payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were $564 million, $343 million and $301 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

9. Financial Instruments and Risk Management

As part of the Company's risk management program, AMR uses a variety of financial instruments, including fuel swap and option contracts and interest rate swaps.
Prior to September 2002, the Company also used currency option contracts and exchange agreements. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.


9. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Continued)

The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these financial instruments, but it does not expect any
of the counterparties to fail to meet its obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the
reporting date, reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. To manage credit risks, the Company selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty
under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. The Company also maintains industry-standard security agreements with
a number of its counterparties which may require the Company or the counterparty to post collateral if the value of these instruments falls below certain mark-to-market
thresholds. The Company's outstanding collateral as of December 31, 2002 is included in restricted cash and short-term investments and is not material. The Company's credit rating
has limited its ability to enter into certain types of fuel hedge contracts. A further deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position may negatively affect the Company's ability to hedge
fuel in the future.

Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as
amended (SFAS 133). SFAS 133 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets,
liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive
income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. The adoption of SFAS 133 did
not result in a cumulative effect adjustment being recorded to net income for the change in accounting. However, the Company recorded a transition adjustment of approximately $64 million in
Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of 2001.

Fuel Price Risk Management

American enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude swap and option contracts to protect against increases in jet fuel prices. These instruments generally have
maturities of up to 36 months. In accordance with SFAS 133, the Company accounts for its fuel swap and option contracts as cash flow hedges. Upon the adoption of SFAS 133, the
Company recorded the fair value of its fuel hedging contracts in Other assets and Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the ineffective
portion of its fuel hedge contracts by comparing the cumulative change in the total value of the fuel hedge contract, or group of fuel hedge contracts, to the cumulative change in the forecasted value
of the jet fuel being hedged. If the total cumulative change in value of the fuel hedge contract more than offsets the total cumulative change in the forecasted value of the jet fuel being hedged, the
difference is considered ineffective and is immediately recognized as a component of Aircraft fuel expense. Effective gains or losses on fuel hedging contracts are deferred in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss and are recognized in earnings as a component of Aircraft fuel expense when the underlying jet fuel being hedged is used.

The
Company monitors the commodities used in its fuel hedging programs to determine that these commodities are expected to be "highly effective" in offsetting changes in its forecasted
jet fuel prices. In doing so, the Company uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the percentage change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (i.e., WTI Crude oil and
NYMEX Heating oil) to the percentage change in prices of jet fuel over a 36 month period. The fuel hedge contracts are deemed to be "highly effective" if this correlation is within
80 percent to 125 percent.


9. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Continued)

For the year ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized net gains of approximately $4 million, $29 million and
$545 million, respectively, as a component of fuel expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to its fuel hedging agreements. The net gains recognized in 2002 and
2001 included approximately $13 million and $72 million of expense related to ineffectiveness, respectively, relating to the Company's fuel hedging agreements. At December 31,
2002, American had fuel hedging agreements with broker-dealers on approximately 1.7 billion gallons of fuel products, which represented approximately 32 percent of its expected 2003 fuel
needs, approximately 15 percent of its expected 2004 fuel needs, and approximately four percent of its expected 2005 fuel needs. The fair value of the Company's fuel hedging agreements at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, representing the amount the Company would receive to terminate the agreements, totaled $212 million and $39 million, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk Management

American uses interest rate swap contracts to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate obligations to floating-rate obligations.
Under SFAS 133, the Company accounts for its interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges whereby the fair value of the related interest rate swap agreement is reflected in Other assets
with the corresponding liability being recorded as a component of Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has no ineffectiveness with regard to its interest rate
swap contracts. The fair value of the Company's interest rate swap agreements, representing the amount the Company would receive if the agreements were terminated at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
was approximately $21 million and $11 million, respectively.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

To hedge against the risk of future exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of American's foreign cash flows, the Company previously entered into various currency
put option agreements on a number of foreign currencies. These instruments generally had maturities of up to 12 months. In accordance with SFAS 133, the Company accounted for its
currency put option agreements as cash flow hedges. Upon the adoption of SFAS 133, the Company recorded the fair value of its foreign currency put option agreements in Other assets and
Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Effective gains and losses on currency put option agreements were deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and
recognized in earnings as a component of passenger revenue when the underlying hedged revenues were recognized. The ineffectiveness associated with the Company's currency put option agreements was not
material. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized net gains of approximately $14 million as a component of passenger revenue related to its foreign currency put
option agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2002 amounts related to the Company's foreign currency put options were not material. The Company has discontinued entering into new foreign
exchange currency put option agreements. All remaining foreign currency put option agreements expired before December 31, 2002.

The
Company has entered into Japanese yen currency exchange agreements to effectively convert certain yen-based capital lease obligations into dollar-based obligations. Under
SFAS 133, the Company accounts for its Japanese yen currency exchange agreements as cash flow hedges whereby the fair value of the related Japanese yen currency exchange agreements is reflected
in Other liabilities and deferred credits and Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has no ineffectiveness with regard to its Japanese yen currency
exchange agreements. The fair value of the Company's yen currency exchange agreements, representing the amount the Company would pay to terminate the agreements, were $44 million and
$45 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The exchange rates on the Japanese yen agreements range from 66.5 to 113.5 yen per U.S. dollar.


9. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Continued)

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices where available. For long-term debt not actively
traded, fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were (in millions):

The
change in valuation allowance in 2002 related to the Company's uncertainty regarding the realization of the foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating losses. The
change in valuation allowance in 2001 related to the Company's uncertainty regarding the realization of the foreign tax credit carryforwards.

Additionally,
as of December 31, 2002, the recording of Other Comprehensive Income items, primarily the minimum pension liability, resulted in a net deferred tax asset. The
Company recorded a $313 million valuation allowance as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to such net deferred tax asset.

The
Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing
the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (including reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those temporary differences will become
deductible.

At
December 31, 2002, the Company had available for federal income tax purposes an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $500 million which is
available for an indefinite period, and federal net operating losses of approximately $1.2 billion for regular tax purposes which will fully expire, if unused, in 2022. The Company had
available for state income tax purposes net operating losses of $2.3 billion, which expire, if unused, in years 2005 through 2022.

Cash
payments (refunds) for income taxes were $(646) million, $(28) million and $49 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The amounts received in 2002 relate
primarily to net operating loss carryback claims, including a carryback claim filed as a result of a provision in Congress' economic stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of net
operating losses (NOLs). This change allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather than two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover its
NOLs.

11. Stock Awards and Options

Under the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, officers and key employees of AMR and its subsidiaries may be granted stock options, stock appreciation
rights (SARs), restricted stock, deferred stock, stock purchase rights, other stock-based awards and/or performance-related awards, including cash bonuses. The total number of common shares authorized
for distribution under the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan is 23,700,000 shares. The 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan, the successor to the 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, which expired May 18, 1998,
will terminate no later than May 21, 2008. Options granted under the 1988 and 1998 Long Term Incentive Plans (collectively, the Plans) are awarded with an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the stock on date of grant, become exercisable in equal annual installments over five years following the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. SARs may be
granted in tandem with options awarded; however, no SARs have been granted. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 2.6 million shares were available for future grant under the Plans.


11. Stock Awards and Options (Continued)

As a result of the Sabre spin-off in March 2000, AMR's stock price was adjusted from $60


/


to $25


/


by the
New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, all outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards, including the related exercise prices, were adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of the stock
options and awards. See Note 15 for information regarding the Sabre spin-off.

In
2002, 2001 and 2000, the total charge for stock compensation expense included in wages, salaries and benefits expense, primarily related to the Company's performance share plan, was
$9 million, $21 million and $52 million, respectively. No compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants under the Plans since the exercise price was equal to the
fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

In May 1997, in conjunction with the labor agreement reached between American and members of the Allied Pilots Association (APA), the Company established
the Pilots Stock Option Plan (The Pilot Plan). The Pilot Plan granted members of the APA the option to purchase 11.5 million shares of AMR stock at $41.69 per share, $5 less than the average
fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, May 5, 1997. These shares were exercisable immediately. In conjunction with the Sabre spin-off, the exercise price was adjusted

weighted-average grant date fair value per share of performance share awards granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $25.98, $28.27 and $32.93, respectively.


11. Stock Awards and Options (Continued)

In March 2003, the Board of Directors of AMR approved the issuance of additional shares of AMR common stock of up to 30 percent of the 156,359,955
outstanding shares of AMR common stock to employees and vendors, lessors and suppliers in connection with ongoing negotiations about concessions. Also in March 2003, the Compensation Committee
of the AMR Board of Directors adopted the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (2003 Plan) to provide equity awards to employees in connection with wage, benefit and work rule concessions. Under the
2003 Plan, all employees of AMR and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted awards which may include stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock. On March 31, 2003, the Company
reached agreements with the leaders of the three major unions representing American employees (the Labor Agreements). In connection with the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, the Labor
Agreements provide for the issuance of up to 38 million shares of AMR stock in the form of stock options which will be granted under the 2003 Plan if the Labor Agreements are ratified. These
shares will generally vest over a three year period, will be granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date (the day following the ratification date) and
will expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant. The remaining shares approved by the AMR Board of Directors are available for future issuance to employees, vendors, lessors and
suppliers.

12. Retirement Benefits

All regular employees of the Company are eligible to participate in pension plans. The defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees based on
years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Airline pilots also participate in a defined contribution plan for which Company contributions are
determined as a percentage of participant compensation.

Effective
January 1, 2001, American established a defined contribution plan for non-contract employees in which the Company will contribute a match up to
5.5 percent on employee contributions of pensionable earnings to the Company's existing 401(k) plan. During 2000, American provided a one-time election for current
non-contract employees to remain in the defined benefit plan or discontinue accruing future credited service in the defined benefit plan as of January 1, 2001 and begin
participation in the defined contribution plan. Effective January 1, 2002, all new non-contract employees of the Company will become members of the defined contribution plan.

In
addition to pension benefits, other postretirement benefits, including certain health care and life insurance benefits, are also provided to retired employees. The amount of health
care benefits is limited to lifetime maximums as outlined in the plan. Substantially all regular employees of American and employees of certain other subsidiaries may become eligible for these
benefits if they satisfy eligibility requirements during their working lives.

Certain
employee groups make contributions toward funding a portion of their retiree health care benefits during their working lives. AMR funds benefits as incurred and makes
contributions to match employee prefunding.

In
connection with the acquisition of TWA in April 2001 (see Note 17), the Company assumed certain retiree benefit plan liabilities of TWA, primarily its postretirement
benefit obligation. As such, the following information reflects the inclusion of these obligations from the date of acquisition. In addition, effective January 1, 2002, TWA LLC employees were
eligible to begin participation in American's pension plans. However, these employees were not granted prior credited service.

As
of December 31, 2002, the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of
plan assets were approximately $7.3 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for
pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were approximately $4.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.

At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, other benefits plan assets of approximately $98 million and $93 million, respectively, were invested in shares of mutual funds managed
by a subsidiary of AMR.

14. Earnings Per Share

For
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, approximately four million and 11 million potential dilutive shares, respectively, were not added to the denominator because
inclusion of such shares would be antidilutive.


15. Discontinued Operations

On February 7, 2000, the Company declared its intent to distribute AMR's entire ownership interest in Sabre as a dividend on all outstanding shares of its
common stock. To effect the dividend, AMR exchanged all of its 107,374,000 shares of Sabre's Class B common stock for an equal number of shares of Sabre's Class A common stock. Effective
after the close of business on March 15, 2000, AMR distributed 0.722652 shares of Sabre Class A common stock for each share of AMR stock owned by AMR's shareholders. The record date for
the dividend of Sabre stock was the close of business on March 1, 2000. In addition, on February 18, 2000, Sabre paid a special one-time cash dividend of $675 million
to shareholders of record of Sabre common stock at the close of business on February 15, 2000. Based upon its approximate 83 percent interest in Sabre, AMR received approximately
$559 million of this dividend. The dividend of AMR's entire ownership interest in Sabre's common stock resulted in a reduction to AMR's retained earnings in March of 2000 equal to the carrying
value of the Company's investment in Sabre on March 15, 2000, which approximated $581 million. The fair market value of AMR's investment in Sabre on March 15, 2000, based upon the
quoted market closing price of Sabre Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, was approximately $5.2 billion. In addition, effective March 15, 2000, the Company
reduced the exercise price and increased the number of employee stock options and awards by approximately 19 million to offset the dilution to the holders, which occurred as a result of the
spin-off. These changes were made to keep the holders in the same economic position as before the spin-off. This dilution adjustment was determined in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force Consensus No. 90-9, "Changes to Fixed Employee Stock Option Plans as a Result of Equity Restructuring", and had no impact on earnings.

The
results of operations for Sabre, have been reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations. Summarized financial information of the discontinued
operations is as follows (in millions):

16. Segment Reporting

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", as amended (SFAS 131),
requires that a public company report annual and interim financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments, as defined, are components of an enterprise
about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

The
Company has two primary operating segments, consisting primarily of American and AMR Eagle, which represent one reportable segment. Following the acquisition of TWA in
April 2001 (see Note 17), American is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2002, American provided scheduled jet service to more than 152 destinations
throughout North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. American is also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world, providing a full range of freight and
mail services to shippers throughout its system. AMR Eagle owns two regional airlines which do business as "American Eagle"—American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive
Airlines, Inc. The American Eagle carriers provide connecting service from eight of American's high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the United States, Canada, the
Bahamas and the Caribbean.


16. Segment Reporting (Continued)

Revenues from other segments are below the quantitative threshold for determining reportable segments and consist primarily of revenues from AMR Investment
Services, Inc. and Americas Ground Services, Inc. The difference between the financial information of the Company's one reportable segment and the financial information included in the
consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets as a result of these entities is not material.

The
Company's operating revenues by geographic region are summarized below (in millions):

The
Company attributes operating revenues by geographic region based upon the origin and destination of each flight segment. The Company's tangible assets consist primarily of flight
equipment which is mobile across geographic markets and, therefore, has not been allocated.

17. Acquisition of TWA Assets

On April 9, 2001, American (through a wholly owned subsidiary, TWA Airlines LLC (TWA LLC)) purchased substantially all of the assets of TWA and assumed
certain liabilities. TWA was the eighth largest U.S. carrier, with a primary domestic hub in St. Louis. American funded the acquisition of TWA's assets with its existing cash and
short-term investments. The acquisition of TWA was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of TWA LLC since the date of acquisition
have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the allocation of the purchase price, which was based on estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
American paid approximately $742 million in cash (subject to certain working capital adjustments) for the purchase of TWA, which included the $625 million purchase price paid to TWA and
various other acquisition costs, primarily the purchase of aircraft security deposits and prepaid rent, and assumed the following obligations: $638 million in current liabilities,
$734 million in postretirement benefits other than pensions, $519 million in capital lease obligations and approximately $175 million of other long-term liabilities.
The purchase price was allocated as follows: approximately $812 million to current assets, $574 million to fixed assets, primarily capital lease
aircraft, and approximately $320 million to other assets, resulting in goodwill of approximately $1 billion which was written-off as of January 1, 2002.

The
following table provides unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, assuming the acquisition had occurred as of

In
addition to the above items, during the second quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $57 million charge for the displacement of foreign tax credits resulting from a provision
in Congress' economic stimulus package. The provision changed the period for carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs) from two to five years and allowed the Company to more quickly recover its NOLs.
However, the extended NOL carryback resulted in the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.

During
the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a gain of $45 million from the settlement of a legal matter related to the Company's 1999 labor disruption.
