ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG) a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are American, a Delaware corporation, and, as of December 9, 2013, US Airways Group, a Delaware corporation. AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American which was founded in 1934. US Airways Group was formed in 1982 and its origins trace back to the formation of All American Aviation in 1939. AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. on December 9, 2013. Virtually all of AAG's operations fall within the airline industry.

AAG's and American's principal executive offices are located at 4333 Amon Carter Boulevard, Fort Worth, Texas 76155. AAG's and American's telephone number is 817-967-1234 and their Internet address is

www.aa.com

. Information contained on AAG's website is not and should not be deemed a part of this report or any other report or filing filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Chapter 11 Reorganization

On November 29, 2011 (the Petition Date), AMR Corporation (referred to as AMR prior to December 9, 2013), its principal subsidiary, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors), filed voluntary petitions for relief (the Chapter 11 Cases) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order) approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan).

On December 9, 2013 (the Effective Date), the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement), dated as of February 13, 2013, by and among AMR, AMR Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) and US Airways Group, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group (the Merger), with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR following the Merger. As noted above, immediately following the Merger closing, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc.

As previously reported, in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, trading in AMR’s common stock and certain debt securities on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was suspended on January 5, 2012, and AMR’s common stock and such debt securities were delisted by the SEC from the NYSE on January 30, 2012. On January 5, 2012, AMR’s common stock began trading under the symbol "AAMRQ" (CUSIP 001765106) on the OTCQB marketplace, operated by OTC Markets Group. Pursuant to the Plan, and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, on the Effective Date (i) all existing shares of AAG’s old common stock formerly traded under the symbol "AAMRQ" were canceled and (ii) the Company was authorized to issue up to approximately 544 million shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AAG (AAG Common Stock) by operation of the Plan (excluding shares of AAG Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement). On the Effective Date, the AAG Common Stock was listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "AAL" and AAMRQ ceased trading on the OTCQB marketplace. In addition, AAG’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 (the AAG Series A Preferred Stock), was authorized for trading and listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "AALCP."

Upon emergence from Chapter 11, the Company issued approximately 53 million shares of AAG Common Stock to the Company’s old equity holders and certain of the Debtors’ employees and 168 million shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock, which is mandatorily convertible into new AAG Common Stock during the 120-day period after the Effective Date, to certain creditors and employees of the Debtors (including shares deposited in the Disputed Claims Reserve (as defined in the Plan)). Holders of AAMRQ received, for each share of AMR common stock, an initial distribution of approximately 0.0665 shares of the AAG Common Stock in connection with the occurrence of the Effective Date. AAMRQ holders, and those deemed to be treated as such in connection with the elections made pursuant to the Plan, have received and may continue to receive additional distributions of shares of AAG Common Stock based on the trading price of AAG Common Stock during the 120 day period after the Effective Date and the total amount of allowed claims, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. On the Effective Date, the adjusted total Double-Dip General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) was approximately $2.45 billion, the Allowed Single-Dip General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) were approximately $2.45 billion and the Disputed Claims Reserve (as defined in the Plan) was approximately $755 million.


During its Chapter 11 restructuring, AMR and the other Debtors took numerous steps to become more cost competitive in the airline industry. These measures included steps to realize labor cost savings and improve managerial efficiencies, to reconfigure their fleet, and to realize other economies. Through the process under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code and consensual negotiations with its labor unions, American and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle) entered into new restructured collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with each of their respective union groups. The Debtors also froze their four defined benefit pension plans, and terminated the pilot variable income retirement plan, putting in their place a revised defined contribution retirement benefit plan. The Debtors also amended the pilots’ defined benefit pension plan to eliminate lump-sum and similar installment forms of benefit payments from such plan.

The Debtors also took significant actions to reduce non-labor related liabilities on their balance sheets. Specifically, the Debtors rejected or renegotiated financing on more than 400 aircraft, and evaluated and/or renegotiated over 700 real estate leases and over 9,000 vendor contracts. Importantly, during their restructuring, the Debtors successfully implemented their fleet renewal strategy. The Debtors evaluated their fleet based on then-current rates and market values, required maintenance, and the need to phase out older aircraft to achieve necessary fleet efficiencies.

to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8B for further information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases and the Merger.

Merger

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and consistent with the Plan, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of US Airways Group was converted into the right to receive one share of AAG Common Stock. The aggregate number of shares of AAG Common Stock issuable in the Merger to holders of US Airways Group equity instruments (including stockholders, holders of convertible notes, optionees, and holders of restricted stock units (RSUs)) represented 28% of the diluted equity ownership of AAG. The remaining 72% diluted equity ownership in AAG (up to approximately 544 million shares) is distributable, pursuant to the Plan (see "

Chapter 11 - Emergence" above

) to stakeholders, labor unions, and certain employees of AMR and the other Debtors and such 72% of the diluted equity ownership of AAG includes all shares of AAG Common Stock that are or may become issuable upon conversion of shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock such that the aggregate number of shares of AAG Common Stock issuable under the Plan will not exceed 72% of the diluted equity ownership of AAG as of the time of the Merger.

In connection with the completion of the Merger, the NYSE suspended trading in the US Airways Group common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the US Airways Group Common Stock), prior to the opening of the market on December 9, 2013. The NYSE also filed with the SEC a Form 25 Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, to delist the US Airways Group Common Stock from the NYSE and terminate registration of the US Airways Group Common Stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the Plan, as of the Effective Date, the board of directors of AAG was reconstituted to be comprised of 12 members: (i) Thomas W. Horton, AMR’s prior chairman, chief executive officer and president, who currently serves as chairman of AAG and will continue to so serve until the earlier of one year after the closing of the Merger and the day immediately prior to the first annual meeting of stockholders of AAG (provided that such meeting will not occur prior to May 1, 2014), (ii) W. Douglas Parker, formerly chief executive officer of US Airways, Inc., who serves as chief executive officer of AAG and will serve as chairman of AAG following the end of Mr. Horton’s term, (iii) two independent directors designated by AMR, Alberto Ibargüen and Ray M. Robinson, (iv) three independent directors designated by US Airways Group, Matthew J. Hart, Richard C. Kraemer, and Denise M. O’Leary, and (v) five independent directors, James F. Albaugh, Jeffrey D. Benjamin, John T. Cahill (lead independent director), Michael J. Embler, and Richard P. Schifter, who were designated by a search committee consisting of representatives of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of the Debtors and certain representatives of creditors signatory to support agreements with AMR.

Further, on the Effective Date, Mr. Horton (formerly president and chief executive officer), Daniel P. Garton (formerly executive vice president), Isabella D. Goren (formerly senior vice president and chief financial officer), Gary F. Kennedy (formerly senior vice president, general counsel, and chief compliance officer) and James B. Ream (formerly senior vice president of operations) ceased to be executive officers of AAG and American and W. Douglas Parker (chief executive officer of AAG, American, and US Airways Group), J. Scott Kirby (president), Derek J. Kerr (executive vice president and chief financial officer), Robert D. Isom, Jr. (chief operating officer and chief executive officer of US Airways), Elise R. Eberwein (executive vice president - people and communications) and Stephen L. Johnson (executive vice president-corporate affairs) were elected as the executive officers of AAG, American, US Airways Group and US Airways, except as otherwise noted.

On the Effective Date and pursuant to the Plan and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, AAG’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws were amended and restated in their entirety, and an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation


(the Certificate of Incorporation) and a Certificate of Designations with respect to the AAG Series A Preferred Stock was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware immediately prior to the closing of the Merger. Upon issuance of the shares pursuant to the Plan and the Merger Agreement, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with Secretary of State of the State of Delaware solely to change its name to American Airlines Group Inc. Thereafter, the Company filed a Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which integrated the Certificate of Incorporation (including the Certificate of Designations) and the Certificate of Amendment, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

The Merger was intended to qualify, for federal income tax purposes, as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

The Merger has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with AAG treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. US Airways Group’s identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their estimated fair values as of the Effective Date. Goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the Merger over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually.

Airline Operations

As noted above, AAG is a holding company whose primary business activity is the operation of two major network carriers through its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries: American and, as of December 9, 2013, US Airways. As of

December 31, 2013

, American, together with American Eagle and the third-party regional carriers that provide regional feed to American, served more than


communities in more than


countries using a combined network fleet of


aircraft. American is a founding member of

one

world® alliance and is one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world, providing a wide range of freight and mail services to shippers throughout its system onboard its passenger fleet. American had approximately

87 million

passengers boarding its mainline flights in


.

US Airways Group is a holding company whose wholly-owned subsidiaries include US Airways, Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Piedmont) and PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA). As of

December 31, 2013

, those carriers and the third-party regional carriers that provide regional feed to US Airways served more than


airports in more than 20 countries using a combined network fleet of


aircraft.

Following the Merger, AAG began moving toward operating under the single brand name of "American Airlines" through its mainline operations, American and US Airways. Until a single operating certificate is issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the operational integration is complete, American and US Airways will continue to operate as separate airlines. This process is expected to take 18-24 months. Through its operating subsidiaries, including the operating subsidiaries of US Airways Group, AAG is the largest airline in the world as measured by revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and available seat miles (ASMs). The Company has primary hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. As of

December 31, 2013

, the combined airline, together with its third-party regional carriers operated nearly

6,700

daily flights to


destinations in


countries. As of

December 31, 2013

, American and US Airways operated


mainline jets. American continues to be provided with regional feed by American Eagle and third-party regional carriers and US Airways continues to be provided with regional feed by Piedmont, PSA and third-party regional carriers. As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company's regional subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers that provide it with regional feed operated approximately


regional jets and approximately


turboprops.

See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -

"Results of Operations"

for a discussion of AAG’s and American’s operating results and operating performance. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our operating segments and operating revenue in principal geographic areas.

Regional Operations

Certain air carriers, including our wholly-owned regional carriers, American Eagle, Piedmont and PSA, and third-party regional carriers, have arrangements with us to provide regional feed under the trade name "American Eagle" or "US Airways Express." As of December 31, 2013, 15 regional aircraft were also provided by a third party operating under the "American Connection" brand, an arrangement that we expect to end during 2014. American Eagle and US Airways Express carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on feeder traffic from these regional carriers, which carry passengers to our hubs from low-density markets that are uneconomical for us to serve with large jets. In addition, regional carriers offer


complementary service in our existing mainline markets by operating flights during off-peak periods between mainline flights. During 2013, approximately 22 million passengers boarded our regional, air carriers' planes, approximately 43% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. Of these passengers, approximately 18 million were enplaned by our wholly owned regional carriers, approximately 4 million were enplaned by third-party regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements and less than 1 million were enplaned by carriers operating under prorate agreements, as described below.

The American Eagle and US Airways Express arrangements are principally in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, mail and freight revenues, go to us. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees and passenger liability insurance, will be reimbursed 100% by us. We control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. A very small number of regional aircraft are operated for us under prorate agreements, under which the regional carriers receive a prorated share of ticket revenue and pay certain service fees to us. The prorate carriers are responsible for all costs incurred operating the applicable aircraft. All American Eagle and US Airways Express carriers have logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to our mainline operations.

Cargo

Our cargo division is one of the largest air cargo operations in the world, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe.

Other revenues

Other revenues include revenue from the marketing services related to the sale of mileage credits in the AAdvantage and Dividend Miles programs as discussed below under "

Frequent Flyer Program"

, membership fees and related revenue from our Admirals Club operations, our US Airways Club operations, and other miscellaneous service revenue, including administrative service charges and baggage handling fees.

The U.S. Airline Industry

In


, the U.S. airline industry experienced year-over-year growth in passenger revenues driven by strong demand for air travel.

In its most recent data available, Airlines for America, the trade association for U.S. airlines, reported that annual U.S. industry passenger revenues and yields increased

3.8%

and

2.0%

, respectively, as compared to 2012. With respect to international versus domestic performance, Airlines for America reported that the Atlantic and Latin America markets outperformed domestic markets in year-over-year growth in passenger revenues while the Pacific market experienced year-over-year declines in passenger revenues.

Throughout 2013, jet fuel prices continued to follow the price of Brent crude oil more closely than the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. On average, fuel costs were down slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012. The Brent crude oil average daily spot price was

$109

per barrel in 2013 which is slightly lower than the average daily spot price in 2012 of

$112

per barrel. However, on a daily basis, prices continued to be volatile. Throughout 2013, daily spot prices fluctuated between a high of

$119

per barrel in February to a low of

$97

per barrel in April and closed the year at

$110

per barrel on December 31, 2013.

While the U.S. airline industry is currently benefiting from a favorable revenue environment and moderating fuel price increases as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the economic conditions driving these factors. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "

Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity."

Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Domestically, any U.S. airline deemed fit by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its possessions, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations and other facilities (Slots). Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and frequent flyer initiatives. On most of our domestic non-stop routes, we currently face competing service from at least one, and sometimes more than one, domestic airline, including: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin America. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes.


We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.

On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slack travel periods, when they begin service to new cities or when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow and maximize revenue per ASM and to establish, increase or preserve market share. Discount and promotional fares are generally non-refundable and may be subject to various restrictions such as minimum stay requirements, advance ticketing, limited seating and change fees. We have often elected to match discount or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market. Our ability to compete on the basis of price is limited by our fixed costs and depends on our ability to manage effectively our operating costs. Some of our competitors have greater financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than we do. In addition, low fare, low-cost carriers compete in many of the markets in which we operate and competition from these carriers is increasing. These low cost carriers generally have lower cost structures than American and US Airways.

In addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle and US Airways Express regional carriers increase the number of markets the Company serves by flying to lower demand markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of the Company’s competitors also own or have marketing agreements with regional airlines which provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, frequent flyer programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products, markets served and other services. We compete with both major network airlines and low-cost airlines throughout our network.

In addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Asia. Revenues from foreign operations (flights serving international destinations) were approximately

40%

of American’s total operating revenues and approximately

24%

of US Airways’ total operating revenues for


. In providing international air transportation, we compete with foreign investor-owned airlines, foreign state-owned airlines, and U.S. airlines that have been granted authority to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations.

Marketing and Alliance Agreements with Other Airlines

In general, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets beyond the nonstop city pair have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers' rights to carry passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. To improve access to each other's markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers - including American and US Airways - have established marketing relationships with other airlines and rail companies. American currently has marketing relationships with Air Berlin, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, EL AL, Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hainan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, JetStar Airways, LAN (includes LAN Airlines, LAN Argentina, LAN Colombia, LAN Ecuador and LAN Peru), Malaysia Airlines, Niki Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Seaborne Airlines, TAM Airlines, and WestJet.

American is also a founding member of the

one

world alliance, which includes AirBerlin, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, and S7 Airlines. TAM Airlines and SriLankan Airlines are scheduled to join the alliance in the first half of 2014. The

one

world alliance links the networks of the member carriers to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers' frequent flyer programs and access to the carriers' airport lounge facilities. Together,

one

world members and members-elect serve


destinations with over

14,000

daily flights to


countries.

American is party to antitrust-immunized cooperation agreements with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, and Royal Jordanian. Over the last three years, American has also established joint business agreements (JBAs) with British Airways, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Qantas and Finnair that enable the carriers to cooperate on flights between particular destinations, and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced frequent flyer program reciprocity, and cooperation in other areas. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into these JBAs. In addition, in December 2012, American signed codeshare agreements with Sao Paulo-based TAM Airlines and Bogota-based LAN Colombia. Generally, under a codeshare arrangement, one carrier places its designator code and sells ticket on flights of another carrier. Once approved in Brazil and Colombia, respectively, these new codeshare relationships will provide expanded opportunities for American to serve new markets in Brazil and Colombia and for TAM Airlines and LAN Colombia to serve new markets in the U.S.

US Airways is currently a member of the Star Alliance®, which offers similar member benefits as those discussed above for the

one

world alliance, and will transition to

one

world on March 31, 2014. As part of this transition, codeshare and frequent


flyer reciprocity between US Airways and many members of the Star Alliance will be ending on March 30, 2014. Some of the largest airlines that will be phased out at that time include United Airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss, Brussels Airlines, and All Nippon Airways, while others will be phased out in the following months. We are in negotiations with International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, concerning the terms by which flights operated by US Airways will be added to our existing transatlantic joint business. We have thus far been unable to reach agreement with IAG and are uncertain if we will be able to reach an agreement. US Airways’ entry into the JBA and cooperation with other carriers is subject to compliance with all DOT regulations and applicable orders as well as obtaining required DOT approvals. US Airways is expected to enter into codeshare cooperation with selected

one

world member airlines and frequent flyer reciprocity with all other members. US Airways is also expected to enter into marketing relationships with selected other airlines that are currently party to marketing agreements with American.

Industry Regulation and Airport Access

General

Our airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation. However, DOT and the FAA still exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers. DOT maintains jurisdiction over the approval of domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, and consumer protection and competition matters, such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.

The FAA regulates flying operations, primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance, and other operational and safety areas. Pursuant to these regulations, our airline subsidiaries have FAA-approved maintenance programs for each type of aircraft they operate. The programs provide for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from periodic routine inspections to major overhauls. FAA requirements cover, among other things, retirement and maintenance of older aircraft, safety measures, collision avoidance systems, airborne windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement, other environmental concerns, fuel tank inerting, crew scheduling and aircraft operations. We are also progressing toward the completion of numerous airworthiness directives, a number of which require us to perform significant maintenance work and to incur additional expenses. Based on the current implementation schedule, we expect to be in full compliance with the applicable requirements within the required time periods. Our failure to timely comply with these requirements has in the past and could in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. The FAA also operates the air traffic control (ATC) system in the United States.

Additionally, the FAA recently implemented rules on pilot flight and duty times, and finalized rules on minimum requirements for all pilots operating commercial aircraft. Both rules have increased our costs and reduced staffing flexibility, particularly during irregular operations. We are also working with the FAA on integrating US Airways and American into a single operating certificate under the American operations specifications.

Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the "ticket tax," on domestic and international air transportation. Airlines collect the ticket tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation, and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although these taxes are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. See "

Industry Regulation and Airport Access - Security,

" below for a discussion of passenger fees.

Most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge (PFC). The ability of airports to increase this charge (and the ability of airlines to contest such increases) is restricted by federal legislation, DOT regulations and judicial decisions. With certain exceptions, air carriers pass these charges on to passengers. However, our ability to pass through the total amount of the PFC to our customers is subject to various factors, including market conditions and competitive factors. The current cap on the PFC is $4.50 per passenger, but the industry has faced repeated efforts in Congress to raise the cap to a higher level including in the last session of Congress.

DOT consumer rules that took effect in 2010 require procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, including additional reporting requirements for airlines, that have increased the cost of airline operations and reduced revenues. The DOT has been aggressively investigating alleged violations of these rules. In addition, the DOT finalized a second set of rules that further regulate airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport and on board the aircraft. These rules require airlines to display all fares in an "all in" basis, with the price of the air travel and all taxes and government imposed fees rolled into the displayed fare. Enhanced disclosure of ancillary fees such as baggage fees is also required. Other rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international carriers.

We anticipate a third set of consumer rules to be issued by the DOT in 2014 and the DOT continues its efforts to further regulate airlines through increased data reporting requirements, expansion of the Air Carrier Access Act, and greater oversight


of the methods airlines use to describe and sell air transportation and other products and services. Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to our operation. In this environment, no assurance can be given that compliance with these new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight from the DOJ, the FAA or other regulatory bodies will not have a material adverse effect on our business.

Among its regulatory responsibilities, DOT also enforces equal access to air transportation for disabled passengers. Recently, a number of carriers, including American and US Airways, have entered into consent orders with DOT over their handling of disabled passengers. DOT has been aggressive in prosecuting disability violations and seeks large penalties. We expect to see continued DOT emphasis in this area through both regulation and enforcement.

DOT and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and CBAs. In addition, as a result of heightened levels of concern regarding data privacy, we are subject to an increasing number of domestic and foreign laws regarding the privacy and security of passenger and employee data.

International

International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. Our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or governmental authorities, such as the European Union (EU), and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral and multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries we serve are periodically subject to renegotiation. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, Slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations. The open skies agreement between the U.S. and Brazil, which was signed in 2010 and takes full effect in 2015, has resulted in increased competition in the U.S./Brazil market. In addition, at some foreign airports, an air carrier needs Slots and other facilities before the air carrier can introduce new service or increase existing service. The availability of such Slots is not assured and our inability to obtain and retain needed Slots and facilities could therefore inhibit our efforts to compete in certain international markets. Further, pursuant to the Merger clearance process in the EU, we are required to make available to other carriers certain Slots at London Heathrow. See "

Industry Regulation and Airport Access - Airport Access and Operations,

" below.

Security

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the Aviation Security Act) was enacted in November 2001. Under the Aviation Security Act, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security screening were federalized, and a new Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the DOT was created. The TSA was then transferred to the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Aviation Security Act, among other matters, mandates improved flight deck security; carriage at no charge of federal air marshals; enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors; enhanced security training; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports pursuant to regulations issued in connection with the Aviation Security Act; and the provision of certain passenger data to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer monies. A "passenger security fee," which is collected by air carriers from their passengers, is currently set at a rate of $2.50 per flight segment but not more than $10 per round trip. However, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 increased the passenger security fee to $5.60 per one-way trip effective on July 1, 2014. An air carrier fee, or Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee (ASIF), has also been imposed with an annual cap equivalent to the amount that an individual air carrier paid in calendar year 2000 for the screening of passengers and property. The fee was repealed by federal legislation and the repeal will go into effect on October 1, 2014.

Implementation of and compliance with the requirements of the Aviation Security Act have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs for us and our passengers and have resulted and will likely continue to result in service disruptions and delays. As a result of competitive pressure, we and other airlines may be unable to recover all of these additional security costs from passengers through increased fares. In addition, we cannot forecast what new security and safety requirements may be imposed in the future or the costs or financial impact of complying with any such requirements.


Airline Fares

Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve. While air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions, fare overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets.

Airport Access

and Operations

Operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports we serve are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of Slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each Slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period.

In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of Slots, Slot exemptions, operating authorizations, or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan National in Washington, D.C., LaGuardia and JFK in New York City, and Newark. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of Slots or analogous regulatory authorities. Similarly, our operations at Frankfurt, London Heathrow, Paris, Tokyo Narita and certain other international airports are regulated by local Slot coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport Association’s Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines (WSG) and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient Slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are often sought after by other airlines, and are subject to changes in governmental policies.

In connection with the settlement of antitrust litigation brought by the DOJ and certain states, we entered into settlement agreements that provide for certain asset divestitures. In the agreement with the United States government, among other things, we agreed to divest and not reacquire for ten years certain rights and assets consisting of 52 Slot pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport and 17 Slot pairs at LaGuardia, in each case together with associated gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those Slot pairs, and two gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport. The agreement with the plaintiff states requires our airlines, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, to maintain certain hub operations in a manner generally consistent with historical operations and to continue to provide scheduled daily service to certain specified communities, both for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from Washington Reagan National Airport. Further, as a consequence of the Merger clearance process in the EU, we are required to make available one pair of London Heathrow Slots for use by another carrier between London and Philadelphia, which the acquiring carrier can deploy on another Heathrow city pair after operating the Slots on London-Philadelphia for a period of not less than three consecutive years, and, along with our JBA partners, we are required to make available for an initial period of up to seven years one pair of Heathrow Slots for service between London and Miami that may be operated via an intermediate point.

Amendments to the Wright Amendment have reduced geographic restrictions on operations at Dallas Love Field (DAL) and in October 2014, will eliminate all such domestic non-stop geographic restrictions on operations there. Southwest has already announced plans to serve new markets throughout the continental United States from DAL in October 2014. Although we held two gates at DAL, we did not operate from there in 2013 and instead operated solely at Dallas Fort Worth. An element of our settlement of the antitrust litigation brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and certain states relating to the Merger included our divestiture of the two gates we held at DAL.

The DOT allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems, provided such procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. Certain locales, including Boston, Washington D.C., Chicago, San Diego and San Francisco, among others, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of these operations. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs, and these restrictions could limit the ability of our airline subsidiaries to expand their operations at the affected airports. Authorities at other airports may adopt similar noise regulations. See "

Industry Regulation and Airport Access - Environmental Matters

," below.

Civil Reserve Air Fleet

We are a participant in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, which is a voluntary program administered by the U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command. The General Services Administration of the U.S. Government requires that airlines participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program in order to receive U.S. Government business. We are reimbursed at compensatory rates if aircraft are activated under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program or when participating in Department of


Defense business. If a substantial number of our aircraft are activated for operation under the CRAF program at a time of war or other national emergency, our business operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In January 2014, the U.S. Air Force proposed a radical restructuring of the CRAF program to take effect in October 2015. We do not support the new proposals as they could adversely affect our business and, together with other industry participants, we are working with the Air Force to address our concerns.

Environmental Matters

The airline industry is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.

The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.

Many aspects of the Company's operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, in particular, may result in the imposition of additional international and domestic legislation or regulation. For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in the EU. The EU adopted a directive under which each EU member state is required to extend the ETS to aviation operations. This directive would have required us, beginning in 2012, in order to operate flights to and from airports in the European Economic Area (EEA), including flights between the U.S. and EU member states

,

to annually submit emission allowances equal to our total carbon dioxide emissions from those flights. While a certain portion of those allowances are granted to us at no cost, we may potentially need to also purchase allowances in order to cover our emissions total in a given year. However, in an effort to allow ICAO time to propose an alternate scheme to manage global aviation emissions, in April 2013 the EU suspended for one year the ETS' application to flights entering and departing the EEA, limiting its application, for flights flown in 2012, to intra-EEA flights only. In October 2013, the ICAO Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the development through ICAO of a global, market-based scheme for aviation emissions, to be implemented in 2020. Subsequently, the EU has proposed amending the EU ETS so that the monitoring, reporting and submission of allowances for emissions from flights flown in 2013 would continue to be limited to only intra-EEA flights. For flights flown from 2014 to 2020, the scope of coverage under the amendment would include intra-EEA flights and the portion of aviation emissions of flights to and from EU member states that take place in European regional airspace. The EU anticipates approval of this amendment in April 2014. The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 which encourages the DOT to seek an international solution through ICAO and that will allow the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS. While these measures create some uncertainty as to the extent to which we will be required to participate in the ETS going forward, it is nevertheless increasingly likely that in the future we will be required to participate in some form of international arrangement governing aircraft emissions.

In addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation on climate change. Although Congress has not passed comprehensive climate change legislation, several states have adopted mechanisms to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Even without further federal legislation, the EPA may act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In 2009, the EPA issued its final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases, which became effective in January 2010. This regulatory finding sets the foundation for potential future EPA greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act. Depending on the scope of such regulation, certain of our facilities and operations may be subject to additional operating and other permit requirements, potentially resulting in increased operating costs.

The environmental laws to which we are subject include those related to responsibility for potential soil and groundwater contamination. We are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. We anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs; we anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites will not have a material impact on our operations.


Future Regulatory Developments

Future regulatory developments and actions could affect operations and increase operating costs for the airline industry, including our airline subsidiaries. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "

If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate Slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations

," "

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages"

and "

We are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result"

for additional information.

Employees and Labor Relations

The airline business is labor intensive. In


, salaries, wages, and benefits were one of our largest expenses and represented approximately

22%

of our operating expenses. The table below presents our approximate number of active full-time equivalent employees as of

December 31, 2013

.


As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

73%

of AAG's active employees were represented by various labor unions and covered by CBAs. Employees of American, US Airways and AAG's regional subsidiaries are covered by labor agreements as set forth in the table below.

(1) Approximate number of active full-time equivalent employees covered by the contract as of December 31, 2013.

(2) See discussion below regarding the process for combining mainline employee groups post-merger.


Relations with such labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, the National Mediation Board (NMB) is responsible for determining which union, if any, is designated to represent employees. In an airline merger, when different unions represent the employees at the merging carrier, a union may file an application with the NMB to represent the combined group of post-merger employees. The application is reviewed by the NMB which considers whether the operations of the merging carriers have been sufficiently integrated to constitute a single transportation system. After the integration process is found to have created a single transportation system, the NMB then conducts an investigation to determine which union, if any, is to be the representative of the post-merger employees. That union then negotiates a joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA) covering the combined group of post-merger employees.

While the passenger service employees at mainline American are not currently represented by any labor organization, the passenger service employees of mainline US Airways are represented by the Airline Employees Customer Service Association, CWA-IBT (CWA-IBT). When and if the CWA-IBT files a single transportation system application with the NMB, the union is expected to attempt to organize the passenger service employees of both mainline airlines. In the meantime, the US Airways passenger service employees will continue to be represented by the CWA-IBT, and the American passenger service employees will remain unrepresented for labor relations purposes.

Most of the other mainline American ground employees are represented by the Transport Workers Union (TWU) and are covered by existing CBAs. Although those agreements will not become amendable until 2018, the TWU is required under the agreements to file a single transportation system application in order to represent the combined groups of mainline US Airways and mainline American employees. For the fleet service employees, the mechanic and related employees and the stores employees, the TWU may share post-merger representation rights with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). After the NMB has determined that a single transportation system exists and has certified a post-merger representative of the combined employee groups, the process for negotiating new JCBA covering the combined employee groups will commence. That process can take many months or even several years to complete.

Under an agreement reached with the American mainline and the US Airways mainline pilots and a tentative agreement with the American and US Airways mainline flight attendants, a different approach will be used by us to reach JCBAs. The two pilot groups have agreed that, once a post-merger representative has been designated by the NMB, there will be a thirty-day negotiations period, and, if no agreement is reached, a panel of arbitrators will set the remaining terms of the JCBAs that will become amendable on December 31, 2018. The economic terms of the pilot JCBA established by the arbitration panel must conform with the contract that was reached with the two pilot groups. If the tentative agreement with the American mainline and US Airways mainline flight attendants is approved, negotiations over the terms of a JCBA will be conducted for up to 240 days. If no agreement can be reached, a panel of arbitrators will establish the unresolved terms of the JCBA, which is to be set based on economics comparable to those for flight attendants at other legacy airlines.

The merger will have no impact on the CBAs that cover the employees of our wholly-owned subsidiary airlines which are not being merged (American Eagle, Piedmont and PSA). For those employees, the RLA provides that CBAs do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date.

When a RLA CBA becomes amendable, if either party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached, either party may request the NMB to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months and even for several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare under the RLA at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to binding arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, an initial 30-day "cooling off" period commences. Following the conclusion of that 30-day "cooling off" period, if no agreement has been reached, "self-help" (as described below) can begin unless a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) is established. A PEB examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and (if no resolution is reached) is followed by another "cooling off" period of 30 days. At the end of a "cooling off" period (unless an agreement is reached, a PEB is established, or action is taken by Congress), the labor organization may exercise "self-help," such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own "self-help," including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.

The NMB is currently mediating negotiations with the IAM covering the mainline US Airways fleet service employees, the mechanic and related employees, and the store employees, and with the AFA covering the Piedmont flight attendants.

"Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations."


Aircraft Fuel

Our operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel. Based on our 2014 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that as of

December 31, 2013

, a $1 per barrel increase in the price of crude oil would increase our 2014 annual fuel expense by

$104 million

(excluding the effect of our hedges), and by

$87 million

(taking into account such hedges).

The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for American, it's third-party regional carriers and American Eagle, for


through


. AAG's consolidated fuel requirements in 2014 are expected to increase significantly to approximately

4.4 billion

gallons as a result of a full year of US Airways operations.

Total fuel expenses for American Eagle and American's third-party regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


were

$1.1 billion

,

$1.0 billion

and

$946 million

, respectively.

In order to provide a measure of control over price and supply, we trade and ship fuel and maintain fuel storage facilities to support our flight operations. Prior to the Effective Date, we from time to time entered into hedging contracts, which consist primarily of call options, collars (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold put option) and call spreads (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold call option). Heating oil, jet fuel and crude oil are the primary underlying commodities in the hedge portfolio. Depending on movements in the price of fuel, our fuel hedging can result in gains or losses on its fuel hedges. For more discussion see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "

Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity."

As of January


, we had hedges covering approximately

19%

of estimated consolidated AAG (including the estimated fuel requirements of US Airways)


fuel requirements. The consumption hedged for


is capped at an average price of approximately

$2.91

per gallon of jet fuel.

One percent

of our estimated


fuel requirement is hedged using call spreads with protection capped at an average price of approximately

$3.18

per gallon of jet fuel.

Eighteen percent

of our estimated


fuel requirement is hedged using collars with an average floor price of approximately

Fuel prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "

Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity

."

Insurance

We maintain insurance of the types that we believe are customary in the airline industry, including insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage, and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft. Principal coverage includes liability for injury to members of the public, including passengers, damage to property of AAG, its subsidiaries and others, and loss of or damage to flight equipment, whether on the ground or in flight. We also maintain other types of insurance such as workers’ compensation and employer’s liability, with limits and deductibles that we believe are standard within the industry.

Since September 11, 2001, we and other airlines have been unable to obtain coverage for liability to persons other than employees and passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events, which is called war risk coverage, at reasonable rates from the commercial insurance market. We, therefore, purchased our war risk coverage through a special program administered by the FAA, as have most other U.S. airlines. This program, which currently expires

September 30, 2014

,


has been extended numerous times in the past. If this program were not to be extended, we would likely face a material increase in the cost of war risk coverage, and because of competitive pressures in the industry, our ability to pass this additional cost to passengers may be limited. In addition, we have obtained third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance through a special program administered by the FAA, resulting in lower premiums than if we had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market. If the federal insurance program terminates, we would likely face a material increase in the cost of war risk insurance. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "

Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results

."

In addition, insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in general following September 11, 2001. While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the period immediately after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, if commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to the Company or significantly increase its cost, the Company would be materially adversely affected.

Customer Service

We are committed to consistently deliver safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation. Our 2013 operating performance was negatively impacted by more severe summer weather conditions as compared to 2012. We reported the following operating statistics to the DOT for American's mainline operations for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


:

(a) Percentage of reported flight operations arriving on time as defined by the DOT.

(b) Percentage of scheduled flight operations completed.

(c) Rate of mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers.

(d) Rate of customer complaints filed with the DOT per 100,000 enplanements.

Frequent Flyer Programs

American established AAdvantage

®

to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. We believe that the AAdvantage program is one of our competitive strengths. AAdvantage benefits from a growing base of approximately

74 million

members with desirable demographics who have demonstrated a strong willingness to collect AAdvantage miles over other loyalty program incentives and are generally disposed to adjusting their purchasing behavior in order to earn additional AAdvantage miles. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, the American Eagle carriers, the third-party regional carriers and other participating airlines or by using services of other participants in the AAdvantage program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, the American Eagle carriers or other participating airlines, or for other awards. Once a member accrues sufficient mileage for an award, the member may book award travel. Most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. A member's mileage credit does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months.

American sells mileage credits and related services to other participants in the AAdvantage program. There are over

1,000

program participants, including a leading credit card issuer (Citibank), hotels, car rental companies and other products and services companies in the AAdvantage program. We believe that program participants benefit from the sustained purchasing behavior of AAdvantage members, which translates into a recurring stream of revenues for AAdvantage. Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program participants, we reserve the right to change the AAdvantage program at any time without notice, and may end the program with six months notice. As of

December 31, 2013

, AAdvantage had approximately

74 million

total members, and

622.3 billion

outstanding award miles. During


, AAdvantage issued approximately

202.8 billion

miles, of which approximately

64%

were sold to program participants. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - "

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimate

s" for more information on AAdvantage.

US Airways offers a similar frequent flyer program under the Dividend Miles brand that allows participants to earn mileage credits for each paid flight segment on US Airways and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Participants flying in first class or US Airways' international business class (Envoy class) may receive additional mileage credits. Participants can also receive mileage credits through special promotions that US Airways periodically offers and may also earn mileage credits by utilizing certain credit cards and purchasing services from non-airline partners such as hotels and rental car agencies. US


Airways sells mileage credits to credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies and others that participate in the Dividend Miles program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel awards on US Airways or other participating airlines.

US Airways and the other participating airline partners limit the number of seats per flight that are available for redemption by award recipients by using various inventory management techniques. Award travel is generally not permitted on blackout dates, which correspond to certain holiday periods or peak travel dates. We charge various fees for issuing awards dependent upon destination and booking method and for issuing awards within 21 days of the travel date. We reserve the right to terminate Dividend Miles or portions of the program at any time. Program rules, partners, special offers, blackout dates, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change.

Effective January 7, 2014, AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members can earn and redeem miles when traveling across either airline's network. All travel on eligible tickets on both airlines will count toward qualification for elite status in the customer's program of choice. Elite members of each airline can enjoy select reciprocal benefits of both the AAdvantage and Dividend Miles programs, including First and Business Class check-in, priority security and priority boarding, complimentary access to Preferred Seats, priority baggage delivery, and checked bags at no charge, consistent with the current baggage policies for each carrier.

The US Airways Dividend Miles program will transition to the AAdvantage frequent flyer program as soon as commercially feasible.

Ticket Distribution

Passengers can book tickets for travel on American or US Airways through several distribution channels including their direct websites (

www.aa.com

and

www.usairways.com

), our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents and online travel agents (e.g., Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity). To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "

We rely on third party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels

."

Seasonality and Other Factors

Due to the greater demand for air and leisure travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Accordingly, the results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Below are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.

Risk Factors Relating to the Company and Industry-Related Risks

We could experience significant operating losses in the future.

For a number of reasons, including those addressed in these risk factors, we might fail to achieve or maintain profitability and might experience significant losses. In particular, the condition of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices, the state of travel demand and intense competition in the airline industry have had and will continue to have an impact on our operating results, and may increase the risk that we will experience losses.

Downturns in economic conditions adversely affect our business.

Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending, airline industry revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel and changes in booking practices, both of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our revenues. In addition, during challenging economic times, actions by our competitors to increase their revenues can have an adverse impact on our revenues. See "

The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic"

below. Certain labor agreements to which we are a party limit our ability to reduce the number of aircraft in operation, and the utilization of such aircraft, below certain levels. As a result, we may not be able to optimize the number of aircraft in operation in response to a decrease in passenger demand for air travel.

Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.

Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continued to be volatile in 2013.

Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase in the price of fuel can have a material adverse aggregate effect on our operating results and liquidity. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares, impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues sufficiently to offset fuel price increases.

Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future.

We have a large number of older aircraft in our fleet, and these aircraft are not as fuel efficient as more recent models of aircraft, including those we have on order. We intend to continue to execute our fleet renewal plans to, among other things, improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet, and we are dependent on a limited number of major aircraft manufacturers to deliver aircraft on schedule. If we experience delays in delivery of the more fuel efficient aircraft that we have on order, we will be adversely affected.

Our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs. Prior to the closing of the Merger, we sought to manage the risk of fuel price increases by using derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particular level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative contracts. To the extent we use derivative contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices decline significantly, such derivative contracts may limit our ability to benefit from lower fuel costs in the future. Also, a rapid decline in the projected price of fuel at a time when we have fuel hedging contracts in place could adversely impact our short-term liquidity, because


hedge counterparties could require that we post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit. See also the discussion in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - "

AAG Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions - Aircraft Fuel"

and "

American Airlines Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions - Aircraft Fuel."

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and regulations promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) introduce new requirements for centralized clearing for over-the-counter derivatives. This may include our fuel derivative contracts. Our board of directors has approved our election of the CFTC’s end-user exemption, which permits us as a non-financial end user of derivatives to hedge commercial risk and be exempt from the CFTC mandatory clearing requirements. However, depending on the final regulations adopted by the CFTC and other regulators, our derivative contract counterparties may be subject to regulatory requirements and resulting new practices that may raise their costs. Those increased costs may in turn be passed on to us, resulting in increased transaction costs to execute derivative contracts and lower credit thresholds to post collateral.

We have not entered into any fuel hedges since the Effective Date and our current policy is not to do so. Assuming we continue to pursue this policy, once our existing hedge contracts expire or otherwise terminate, we will be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.

The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.

Our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as joint ventures formed by some of these airlines, many of which have more financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, including rail and private automobiles. In many of our markets we compete with at least one low-cost air carrier. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute pricing structures intended to achieve near-term survival rather than long-term viability.

Low-cost carriers have a profound impact on industry revenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from larger, more established airlines. Some low-cost carriers, which have cost structures lower than ours, have better recent financial performance and have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of aircraft for delivery in the next few years. These low-cost carriers are expected to continue to increase their market share through growth and, potentially, consolidation, and could continue to have an impact on our overall performance. For example, amendments to the Wright Amendment have reduced geographic restrictions on operations by Southwest Airlines and other carriers at DAL and will eliminate all domestic non-stop geographic restrictions on operations there in October 2014. This has increased low-cost carrier competition for our operations at Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW). In addition, we expect that the two gates at DAL that we divested as part of our settlement of antitrust litigation related to the Merger will be allocated to low-cost carriers. The actions of the low-cost carriers, including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.

Certain airline alliances have been, or may in the future be, granted immunity from antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered.

We have implemented a JBA with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, and antitrust-immunized cooperation with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair and Royal Jordanian. We are in negotiations with IAG concerning the terms by which flights operated by US Airways will be added to our existing transatlantic joint business. We have thus far been unable to reach agreement with IAG and are uncertain if we will be able to reach an agreement. Failure to reach an agreement could have a material adverse effect on the JBA or cause its dissolution, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. In addition, we have implemented an antitrust-immunized JBA with Japan Airlines and a JBA with Qantas. No assurances can be given as to any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any benefits that we may derive from such arrangements.

Additional mergers and other forms of industry consolidation, including antitrust immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant. Depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with such combinations, our competitive position relative to the post-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could result in lower overall market share and revenues for us. Such consolidation is not limited to the U.S., but could include further consolidation among international carriers in Europe and elsewhere.


We may be unable to integrate operations successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Merger.

The Merger involves the combination of two companies that operated as independent public companies prior to the Merger, and each of which operated its own international network airline. Historically, the integration of separate airlines has often proven to be more time consuming and to require more resources than initially estimated. We must devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices, cultures and operations. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:

•

the inability to successfully combine our businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the Merger;

•

the challenge of integrating complex systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, aircraft fleets, networks, and other assets in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies;

•

the effects of divestitures and other operational commitments in connection with the settlement of the litigation brought by the DOJ and certain states prior to the closing of the Merger;

•

the challenge of forming and maintaining an effective and cohesive management team;

•

the diversion of the attention of our management and other key employees;

•

the challenge of integrating workforces while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality customer service and running an efficient operation;

•

the risks relating to integrating various computer, communications and other technology systems, including designing and implementing an integrated customer reservations system, that will be necessary to operate American and US Airways as a single airline and to achieve cost synergies by eliminating redundancies in the businesses;

•

the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing business;

•

the branding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers; and

•

the potential unknown liabilities, liabilities that are significantly larger than we currently anticipate and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the Merger, including costs in excess of the cash transition costs that we currently anticipate.

We have submitted to the FAA a transition plan for merging the day-to-day operations of American and US Airways under a single operating certificate. The issuance of a single operating certificate will occur when the FAA agrees that we have achieved a level of integration that can be safely managed under one certificate. While the parties currently believe that such approval can be obtained within two years from the closing of the Merger, the actual time required and cost incurred to receive this approval cannot be predicted. Any delay in the grant of such approval or increase in costs beyond those presently expected could have a material adverse effect on the completion date of our integration plan and receipt of the benefits expected from that plan.

See "

We may face

challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems"

below.

Accordingly, we may not be able to realize the contemplated benefits of the Merger fully, or at all, or it may take longer and cost more to realize such benefits than expected.

Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business and liquidity.

We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a substantial portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, they:

limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, to withstand operating risks that are customary in the industry, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, integration costs, and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;

•

make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and catastrophic external events;

•

contain restrictive covenants that could:

▪

limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; and

▪

significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of


opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines; and

•

limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.

We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.

Our business plan contemplates significant investments in modernizing our fleet and integrating the American and US Airways businesses. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan, and, as a result, we estimate that, based on our commitments as of December 31, 2013, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2014-2018 would be approximately $19.5 billion of which $16.3 billion represents commitments by American. We also currently anticipate cash transition costs to integrate our businesses following the Merger to be approximately $1.2 billion, and these costs could exceed our expectations. Accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital resources. In addition, as of the date of this report, we had not secured financing commitments for some of the aircraft that we have on order, and we cannot be assured of the availability or cost of that financing. In particular, we do not have financing commitments for the following aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered through 2016:


Airbus 320 family aircraft,


Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and


Boeing 787 aircraft. In addition, we do not have financing commitments in place for the majority of aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2017 and beyond. The number of aircraft for which we do not have financing may change as we exercise purchase options or otherwise change our purchase and delivery schedules. If we are unable to arrange financing for such aircraft at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase such aircraft or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft with the aircraft manufacturers. Depending on numerous factors, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital at the time we seek capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may only be available on onerous terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Increased costs of financing, a reduction in the availability of financing and fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

Concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, the availability and cost of credit, energy costs and geopolitical issues, combined with continued changes in business activity levels and consumer confidence, increased unemployment and volatile oil prices, have contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility in the capital and credit markets. As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit have in the recent past been and may in the future be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. These changes in the domestic and global financial markets may increase our costs of financing and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing needed for the acquisition of aircraft that we have contractual commitments to purchase and for other types of financings we may seek in order to refinance debt maturities, raise capital or fund other types of obligations. Any downgrades to our credit rating may likewise increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing.

Further, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate for deposits of U.S. dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions, general interest rates, rates set by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities and other of our floating rate debt, and accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period may fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk "

AAG Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions - Interest"

and "

American Airlines Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions - Interest."

Our high level of fixed obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and causes our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.

We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, pension costs, aircraft leases and financings, aircraft purchase commitments, leases and developments of airport and other facilities and other cash obligations. We also have certain guaranteed costs associated with our regional operations.


As a result of the substantial fixed costs associated with these obligations:

•

a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater percentage decrease in earnings;

•

we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund all of these fixed obligations if our revenues decline or costs increase; and

•

we may have to use our working capital to fund these fixed obligations instead of funding general corporate requirements, including capital expenditures.

These obligations also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

We have significant pension and other post-employment benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Upon the expiration of those rules, our funding obligations are likely to increase materially. In addition, we may have significant obligations for other post-employment benefits depending on the outcome of an adversary proceeding related to retiree medical and life insurance obligations filed in the Chapter 11 cases.

Any failure to comply with the covenants contained in our financing arrangements may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The terms of our 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility and the Credit Facilities require us to ensure that AAG and its restricted subsidiaries maintain consolidated unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities in an aggregate amount not less than $2.0 billion, and the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility also requires us and the other obligors thereunder to hold not less than $750 million (subject to partial reductions upon certain reductions in the outstanding amount of the loan) of that amount in accounts subject to control agreements.

Our ability to comply with these liquidity covenants while paying the fixed costs associated with our contractual obligations and our other expenses, including significant pension and other post-employment funding obligations and cash transition costs associated with the Merger, will depend on our operating performance and cash flow, which are seasonal, as well as factors including fuel costs and general economic and political conditions.

In addition, our credit facilities and certain other financing arrangements include covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.

The factors affecting our liquidity (and our ability to comply with related liquidity and other covenants) will remain subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. Any breach of our liquidity and other covenants or failure to timely pay our obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the acceleration of our indebtedness, the withholding of credit card proceeds by our credit card processors and the exercise of remedies by our creditors and lessors. In such a situation, we may not be able to fulfill our contractual obligations, repay the accelerated indebtedness, make required lease payments or otherwise cover our fixed costs.

If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.

We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, the failure of American to maintain certain levels of liquidity) to hold an amount of our cash (a "holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. An increase in the current holdback balances to higher percentages up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales could materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other entities to impose less favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition.


The historical consolidated financial information contained in this report is not directly comparable to our financial information for prior or future periods

.

A number of factors render our historical consolidated financial information not directly comparable to our financial information for prior or future periods, including:

•

because the Merger was completed on December 9, 2013, AAG's consolidated results of operations include the results of US Airways Group and its subsidiaries only for 23 days of 2013;

•

the Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with AAG as the acquiring entity, resulting in an adjustment to the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of US Airways Group compared to its historical carrying values;

•

during the course of our Chapter 11 Cases and in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11 and the effectiveness of the Plan, we recorded material expenses, charges, costs and other accounting entries related to our restructuring process, many of which generally had not been incurred in the past and are not expected to be incurred in the future; and

•

certain prior accounting presentations, including the manner in which we report our regional operations, have been changed and historical results restated to conform to the current presentation.

Due to these and other factors largely related to the Merger and the Plan, investors are cautioned as to the limitations of our historical financial statements and urged to review carefully Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.

Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain "amendable dates" rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board (NMB).

If no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day "cooling off" period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day "cooling off" period. At the end of a "cooling off" period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise "self-help," such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are currently in negotiations with

the

IAM with respect to US Airways mechanics, stock clerks and related employees, and fleet service employees, and the AFA with respect to Piedmont flight attendants.

None of these unions presently may lawfully engage in concerted refusals to work, such as strikes, slow-downs, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. See Part I, Item 1 Business-"Employees and Labor Relations."

The inability to maintain labor costs at competitive levels would harm our financial performance.

Currently, we believe our labor costs are competitive relative to the other large network carriers. However, we cannot provide assurance that labor costs going forward will remain competitive because some of our agreements are amendable now and others may become amendable, competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs or we may agree to higher-cost provisions in our current or future labor negotiations. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 73% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions. Some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including related to wages. Unions may also bring court actions and may seek to compel us to engage in bargaining processes where we believe we have no such obligation. If successful, there is a risk these judicial or arbitral avenues could create material additional costs that we did not anticipate.

Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.

We operate principally through hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Substantially all of our flights either originate in or fly into one of these locations.


A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs resulting from ATC delays, weather conditions, natural disasters, growth constraints, relations with third-party service providers, failure of computer systems, facility disruptions, labor relations, power supplies, fuel supplies, terrorist activities or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate Slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.

In order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where appropriate, add service along new or existing routes, we must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, and office space. As airports around the world become more congested, we will not always be able to ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports throughout our network, including due to inadequate facilities at desirable airports. Further, our operating costs at airports at which we operate, including our hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that we may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. In some circumstances, such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without our approval.

In addition, operations at four major domestic airports, certain smaller domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through the use of Slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each Slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period and may have other operational restrictions as well. In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of Slot or Slot exemptions at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and three New York City airports: Newark, JFK and LaGuardia. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of Slots or similar regulatory authority. Similarly, our operations at international airports in Frankfurt, London Heathrow, Paris and other airports outside the U.S. are regulated by local Slot authorities pursuant to the International Air Transport Association’s Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We cannot provide any assurance that regulatory changes regarding the allocation of Slots or similar regulatory authority will not have a material adverse impact on our operations. For example, the FAA is planning a new rulemaking in 2014 to modify the current rules limiting flight operations at New York City’s JFK and LaGuardia airports.

In connection with the settlement of litigation relating to the Merger brought by the DOJ and certain states, we entered into settlement agreements that provide for certain asset divestitures. In the agreement with the United States government, among other things, we agreed to divest and not reacquire for ten years certain rights and assets consisting of 52 Slot pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport, and 17 Slot pairs at LaGuardia, in each case together with and associated gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those Slot pairs, and two gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport. The agreement with the plaintiff states requires our airlines, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, to maintain certain hub operations in a manner generally consistent with historical operations and to continue to provide scheduled daily service to certain specified communities, both for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from Washington Reagan National Airport. Further, as a consequence of the Merger clearance process in the EU, we are required to make available one pair of London Heathrow Slots for use by another carrier between London and Philadelphia, which the acquiring carrier can deploy on another Heathrow city pair after operating the Slots on London-Philadelphia for a period of not less than three consecutive years, and, along with our JBA partners, we are required to make available for an initial period of up to seven years one pair of Heathrow Slots for service between London and Miami that may be operated via an intermediate point.

Any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, Slots (where applicable), or office space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we incur problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.

A significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, primarily under capacity purchase agreements. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risks of disruptions to their operations, which may result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, and other risk factors, such as a bankruptcy restructuring of any of the regional operators. We may also experience disruption to our regional operations if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators and transition the services to another provider. As our regional segment provides revenues to us directly and indirectly (by providing flow traffic to our hubs), any significant disruption to our regional operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.


In addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, ground services and facilities, reservations and baggage handling. Similar agreements may be entered into in any new markets we decide to serve. These agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. We are also at risk should one of these service providers cease operations, and there is no guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers. Volatility in fuel prices, disruptions to capital markets and adverse economic conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional carriers to significant financial pressures, which have led to several bankruptcies among these carriers. Any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.

We rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems, or GDSs (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents and online travel agents, or OTAs (e.g., Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity), to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and we expect in the future to continue to rely on these channels and hope to expand their ability to distribute and collect revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating). These distribution channels are more expensive and at present have less functionality in respect of ancillary product offerings than those we operate ourselves, such as our call centers and our website. Certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute our products generally. To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.

Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and DOT, the FAA, the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security have issued a number of directives and other regulations, that affect the airline industry. These requirements impose substantial costs on us and restrict the ways we may conduct our business.

For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. Our failure to timely comply with these requirements has in the past and may in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. In addition, the FAA recently issued its final regulations governing pilot rest periods and work hours for all airlines certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The rule, which became effective on January 4, 2014, impacts the required amount and timing of rest periods for pilots between work assignments and modifies duty and rest requirements based on the time of day, number of scheduled segments, flight types, time zones, and other factors. These regulations, or other regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us and the industry.

Recent DOT consumer rules require new procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, further regulate airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport, and on board the aircraft, and require new disclosures concerning airline fares and ancillary fees such as baggage fees. The DOT has been aggressively investigating alleged violations of these new rules. Other DOT rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international airlines.

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines.

The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct business each may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:

•

changes in law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports, or the types of fees that can be charged to passengers;

•

the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including antitrust or foreign government


approvals) needed for codesharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines;

•

restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline’s ability to respond to a competitor);

•

the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards (for example, a "passenger bill of rights");

•

restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of Slots at airports or the auction or reallocation of Slot rights currently held by us; and

•

the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.

Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to airline operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. There can be no assurance that our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us.

In April 2013, the FAA announced the imposition of furloughs that resulted in reduced staffing, including among air traffic controllers, in connection with its implementation of budget reductions related to the federal government’s response to the so-called "sequester" of government funding. These furloughs have been suspended as a result of Congressional legislation. However, we cannot predict whether there will be further furloughs or the impact of any such furloughs on our business. Any significant reduction in air traffic capacity at key airports in the U.S. could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also experienced delays in routine non-operational interactions with the FAA as a result of the government shut-down in 2013, and we may experience delays again in the event of any future government shut-down.

In addition, the ATC system is not successfully managing the growing demand for U.S. air travel. Air traffic controllers rely on outdated technologies that routinely overwhelm the system and compel airlines to fly inefficient, indirect routes. On February 14, 2012, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 was signed. The law provides funding for the FAA to rebuild its ATC system, including switching from radar to a GPS-based system. It is uncertain when any improvements to the ATC system will take effect. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements that may be imposed on airlines of a modernized ATC system may have a material adverse effect on our business.

The ability of U.S. airlines to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the U.S. and foreign governments may be amended from time to time and appropriate Slots or facilities may not be made available. We currently operate on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of airlines permitted to operate on the route, the capacity of the airlines providing services on the route, or the number of airlines allowed access to particular airports. If an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes, such an event could have a material adverse impact on us and could result in the impairment of material amounts of our related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition from revenue-sharing joint ventures, JBAs, and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of our business and assets on the open skies routes. For example, the open skies air services agreement between the U.S. and the EU, which took effect in March 2008, provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open access to each other’s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly from the U.S. to any airport in the EU, including London’s Heathrow Airport. As a result of the agreement, we face increased competition in these markets, including Heathrow Airport. In addition, the open skies agreement between the U.S. and Brazil, which was signed in 2010 and takes full effect in 2015, has resulted in increased competition in the U.S./Brazil market.

The airline industry is heavily taxed.

The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue. The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various U.S. fees and taxes also are assessed on international flights. For example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge per passenger on us. In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years. Moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the "ticket tax," on domestic and international air transportation. We collect the excise tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as a per-ticket tax on passengers to fund the TSA, which fee is scheduled to increase effective July 1, 2014), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although these taxes are not operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. There are continuing efforts in Congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed on airlines and their passengers. Increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Under DOT regulations, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our


customers. Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus our revenues. For

example, in January 2014, Congress restructured the September 11 security fee, which will increase the fee on some customers.

Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.

We have implemented several new measures designed to increase revenue and offset costs. These measures include charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket and increasing other pre-existing fees. We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional initiatives. We cannot assure you that these new measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives creates logistical challenges that could harm the operational performance of our airline. Also, the new and increased fees might reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions continue to make our customers more sensitive to increased travel costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges.

The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.

We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.

Acts of terrorism or fear of such attacks, including elevated national threat warnings, wars or other military conflicts, may depress air travel, particularly on international routes, and cause declines in revenues and increases in costs. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and continuing terrorist threats and attempted attacks materially impacted and continue to impact air travel. Increased security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks and other such measures as may be introduced in the future generate higher operating costs for airlines. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals on board flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to U.S. Customs and enhanced background checks. A concurrent increase in airport security charges and procedures, such as restrictions on carry-on baggage, has also had and may continue to have a disproportionate impact on short-haul travel, which constitutes a significant portion of our flying and revenue.

We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.

We operate a global business with operations outside of the U.S. from which American derived approximately 40% of its operating revenues and US Airways derived approximately 24% of its operating revenues in 2013, as measured and reported to the DOT. Our current international activities and prospects have been and in the future could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls or other restrictions on repatriation of funds, currency and political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations, which are more likely in countries with exchange controls such as Venezuela and Argentina), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or Slots.

In particular, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, and exchange controls and other restrictions on the repatriation of funds, have significantly affected and may continue to significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the U.S. in local currency. For example, the business environment in Venezuela has been challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluation, high inflation and governmental restrictions, including currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $710 million of our unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars, valued at a weighted average rate of 6.04 bolivars to the dollar. The period of time to exchange those funds into dollars and repatriate them has been increasing and is presently more than a year. On January 23, 2014, the Venezuelan government


issued a regulation to implement a new system for determining the exchange rate based on the result of limited periodic sales of dollars known as Sicad auctions (currently 11.80 to the dollar based on the February 21, 2014 Sicad auction) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of conversion and repatriation of local currency. The government also enacted a new law effective February 19, 2014 that authorizes additional methods of exchanging Venezuelan bolivars at rates other than the controlled base rate of 6.3 to the dollar or the existing Sicad auction rate, but the regulations necessary to implement the law are still pending and it is not clear at this point whether or how the new methods may impact the pending balances of Venezuelan bolivars held by airlines. We are working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. Further, the current, devalued rates may have an ongoing adverse effect on our reported results if we are unable to fully adjust prices on flights to and from Venezuela, of which there can be no assurance. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result.

We are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Compliance with all environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties.

The EPA has proposed changes to underground storage tank regulations that could affect certain airport fuel hydrant systems. Airport systems that fall within threshold requirements would need to be modified in order to comply with applicable regulations. Additionally, the EPA has proposed the draft 2013 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Industrial Activities. This permit would impose new limitations on certain discharges along with mandatory best management practices. Concurrently, California has proposed the State Final Draft Industrial General Permit for stormwater discharges. This permit employs the use of benchmark values to trigger response actions when exceeding those limits and eliminates group monitoring. These permits have not been finalized, and cost estimates have not been defined, but American and US Airways along with other airlines would share a portion of these costs at applicable airports. In addition to the proposed EPA and state regulations, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of de-icing fluid to the environment, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport de-icing facilities. Such efforts are likely to impose additional costs and restrictions on airlines using those airports. We do not believe, however, that such environmental developments will have a material impact on our capital expenditures or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations, operating costs or competitive position.

We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations, including those that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to us. We have liability for investigation and remediation costs at various sites, although such costs are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.

We have various leases and agreements with respect to real property, tanks and pipelines with airports and other operators. Under these leases and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor or operator against environmental liabilities associated with the real property or operations described under the agreement, even if we are not the party responsible for the initial event that caused the environmental damage. We also participate in leases with other airlines in fuel consortiums and fuel committees at airports, where such indemnities are generally joint and several among the participating airlines.

There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in the EU. The EU adopted a directive under which each EU member state is required to extend the ETS to aviation operations. This directive would have required us, beginning in 2012, to annually submit emission allowances in order to operate flights to and from airports in the European Economic Area (EEA), including flights between the U.S. and EU member states. However, in an effort to allow ICAO time to propose an alternate scheme to manage global aviation emissions, in April 2013 the EU suspended for one year the ETS' application to flights entering and departing the EEA, limiting its application, for flights flown in 2012, to intra-EEA flights only. In October 2013, the ICAO Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the development through ICAO of a global, market-based scheme for aviation emissions, to be implemented in 2020. Subsequently, the EU has proposed amending the EU ETS so


that the monitoring, reporting and submission of allowances for emissions from flights flown in 2013 would continue to be limited to only intra-EEA flights. For flights flown from 2014 to 2020, the scope of coverage under the amendment would include intra-EEA flights and the portion of aviation emissions of flights to and from EU member states that take place in European regional airspace. The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 which encourages the DOT to seek an international solution through ICAO and that will allow the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS. Ultimately, the scope and application of ETS or other emissions trading schemes to our operations, now or in the near future, remains uncertain. We do not anticipate any significant emissions allowance expenditures in 2014. Beyond 2014, compliance with the ETS or similar emissions-related requirements could significantly increase our operating costs. Further, the potential impact of ETS or other emissions-related requirements on our costs will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including baseline emissions, the price of emission allowances and the number of future flights subject to ETS or other emissions-related requirements. These costs have not been completely defined and could fluctuate.

Similarly, within the U.S., there is an increasing trend toward regulating greenhouse gas emissions directly under the Clean Air Act. While the EPA's recent regulatory activity in this area has focused on industries other than aviation, it is possible that future EPA regulations, or new legislation, could impact airlines. Several states are also considering initiatives to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emissions inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the U.S. at the federal and state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs will be in the U.S., the EU or in other areas in which we do business. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs.

Governmental authorities in several U.S. and foreign cities are also considering, or have already implemented, aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews and limitations on daytime take-offs and landings. We have been able to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, but our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.

We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are highly dependent on technology and automated systems to operate our business and achieve low operating costs. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation systems, flight operations systems, financial planning, management and accounting systems, telecommunications systems, website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information, as well as issue electronic tickets and process critical financial information in a timely manner. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets. We depend on our reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. If our automated systems are not functioning or if our third-party service providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support, system maintenance or timely software upgrades for any one of our key existing systems, we could experience service disruptions or delays, which could harm our business and result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operations or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant. Our automated systems cannot be completely protected against other events that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, data theft, equipment and software failures, computer viruses or telecommunications failures. Substantial or sustained system failures could cause service delays or failures and result in our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We cannot assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans are adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruption in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems.

Among the principal risks of integrating our businesses and operations are the risks relating to integrating various computer, communications and other technology systems, including designing and implementing an integrated customer reservations system, that will be necessary to operate US Airways and American as a single airline and to achieve cost synergies by eliminating redundancies in the businesses. The integration of these systems in a number of prior airline mergers has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than originally forecast. The implementation process to integrate these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.


New systems will replace multiple legacy systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware, software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes.

As with any large project, there will be many factors that may materially affect the schedule, cost and execution of the integration of our computer, communications and other technology systems. These factors include, among others: problems during the design, implementation and testing phases; systems delays and/or malfunctions; the risk that suppliers and contractors will not perform as required under their contracts; the diversion of management attention from daily operations to the project; reworks due to unanticipated changes in business processes; challenges in simultaneously activating new systems throughout our global network; difficulty in training employees in the operations of new systems; the risk of security breach or disruption; and other unexpected events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans will be adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruptions in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Ongoing data security compliance requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data breach could harm our business, results of operations

and financial condition.

Our business requires the appropriate and secure utilization of customer and other sensitive information. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities (including cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses and the like), discovery of new vulnerabilities or attempts to exploit existing vulnerabilities in our systems, other data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access and store sensitive information. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Furthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the U.S. and abroad (particularly in the EU), including requirements for varying levels of customer notification in the event of a data breach.

In addition, many of our commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that we must meet. In particular, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security standards. While we continue our efforts to meet these standards, new and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs.

Failure to comply with the Payment Card Industry Standards or other privacy and data use and security requirements of our partners or related laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject may expose us to claims for contract breach, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to address these issues appropriately could also give rise to additional legal risks, which, in turn, could increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur further related costs and expenses.

We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving any of our aircraft or the aircraft of our regional or codeshare operators.

If one of our aircraft, an aircraft that is operated under our brand by one of our regional operators or an aircraft that is operated by an airline with which we have a marketing alliance or codeshare relationship were to be involved in an accident, we could be exposed to significant tort liability. The insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In the event that our insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate, an aircraft that is operated under our brand by one of our regional operators or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our

business, results of operations and financial condition.

The success of our business depends on, among other things, the ability to operate an optimum number and type of aircraft. In many cases, the aircraft we intend to operate are not yet in our fleet, but we have contractual commitments to purchase or lease them. If for any reason we were unable to accept or secure deliveries of new aircraft on contractually scheduled delivery dates, this could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned might require us to seek extensions of the terms for some leased aircraft or


otherwise delay the exit of certain aircraft from our fleet. Such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in increased maintenance costs. If new aircraft orders are not filled on a timely basis, we could face higher operating costs than planned. In addition, if the aircraft we receive do not meet expected performance or quality standards, including with respect to fuel efficiency and reliability, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and many aircraft and engine parts. As a result, we are vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft, parts and engines, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the suppliers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft.

Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality.

Our business, results of operations and financial condition has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:

•

actual or potential changes in international, national, regional, and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks, or political instability;

•

changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns, or demographic trends;

•

changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations, and other factors;

•

actual or potential disruptions to the ATC systems, including as a result of "sequestration" or any other interruption in government funding;

•

increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental measures;

•

outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and

•

weather and natural disasters.

In particular, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, or any other influenza-type illness, if it were to persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.

A higher than normal number of pilot retirements and a potential shortage of pilots could adversely affect us.

We currently have a higher than normal number of pilots eligible for retirement. Among other things, the extension of pilot careers facilitated by the FAA’s 2007 modification of the mandatory retirement age from age 60 to age 65 has now been fully implemented, resulting in large numbers of pilots in the industry approaching the revised mandatory retirement age. If pilot retirements were to exceed normal levels in the future, it may adversely affect us. The FAA also recently issued regulations that increase the flight experience required for pilots working for airlines certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. These and other factors could contribute to a shortage of qualified pilots, which could adversely affect us.

Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers. Accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly, and our ability to continue to obtain insurance even at current prices remains uncertain. In addition, we have obtained third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance through a special program administered by the FAA, resulting in lower premiums than if we had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market. The program has been extended, with the same conditions and premiums, until

September 30, 2014

. If the federal insurance program terminates, we would likely face a material increase in the cost of war risk insurance. The failure of one or more of our insurers could result in a lack of coverage for a period of time. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the claims paying ability of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. Because of competitive pressures in our industry, our ability to pass additional insurance costs to passengers is limited. As a result, further increases in insurance costs or reductions in available insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial results.


Several lawsuits were filed in connection with the Merger and remain pending, and these lawsuits could have a material adverse impact on our business.

US Airways Group, as well as the members of US Airways Group’s board of directors, were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a purported class of US Airways Group’s stockholders challenging the Merger and seeking a declaration that the Merger Agreement is unenforceable, an injunction against the Merger (or rescission in the event it has been consummated), imposition of a constructive trust, an award of fees and costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees, and other relief. US Airways Group, US Airways, AMR and American were also named as defendants in a private antitrust lawsuit. The complaint alleges that the effect of the Merger may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. The relief sought in the complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or divestiture. In January 2014, the complaint was amended to add a claim for money damages and to request injunctive relief requiring the carriers to hold separate their assets. Such private lawsuits could result in an obligation to pay damages or terms, conditions, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions that would impose additional material costs on or materially limit our revenues, or materially limit some of the synergies and other benefits we anticipate following the Merger. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings -

"Merger Class Action"

below.

Our ability to utilize our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards may be limited.

Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction in any taxable year for NOLs carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards). As of December 31, 2013, we had available NOL Carryforwards of approximately

$10.6 billion

for regular federal income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, beginning in

1/1/2022

, and approximately

$4.7 billion

for state income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, between

1/1/2014

and

12/31/2033

. The amount of NOL Carryforwards for state income tax purposes that will expire, if unused, in


is

$106 million

. Our NOL Carryforwards are subject to adjustment on audit by the Internal Revenue Service and the respective state taxing authorities.

A corporation's ability to deduct its federal NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an "ownership change" as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). We experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. While we anticipate taking advantage of certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that would permit approximately

$9.0 billion

of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382, there can be no assurance that these special rules will apply to the ownership change we experienced upon our emergence from bankruptcy, including that we may ultimately elect not to apply them. If the special rules do not apply, our ability to utilize such federal NOL Carryforwards may be subject to limitation. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group and its subsidiaries) are subject to limitation under Section 382 as a result of the Merger; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ownership change subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards, our Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial shareholders. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur, in which case our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes could be severely limited or effectively eliminated.

Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards also will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. The NOL Carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them.

The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in AAG recording a significant amount of goodwill, which amount is tested for impairment at least annually. In addition, AAG and American may never realize the full value of their respective intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing them to record material impairment charges.

In accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules, AAG recorded goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet to the extent the US Airways Group acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of US Airway Group’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually. Also, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, AAG and American will be required to test their respective indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have


occurred. In addition, AAG and American are required to test certain of their other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.

Future impairment of goodwill or other assets could be recorded in results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment could include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions; (ii) higher prices for jet fuel; (iii) lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand; (iv) a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments; and (v) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities, actual or threatened war, labor actions by employees, or further industry regulation. There can be no assurance that a material impairment charge of goodwill or tangible or intangible assets will be avoided. The value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by us or other airlines. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Relating to AAG's Common Stock

The price of our common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile.

The market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

•

AAG's operating and financial results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;

•

changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

•

material announcements by us or our competitors;

•

movements in fuel prices;

•

new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;

•

general and industry-specific economic conditions;

•

the success or failure of AAG's integration efforts;

•

changes in our key personnel;

•

the conversion of AAG Series A Preferred Stock issued pursuant to AAG's plan of reorganization;

•

distributions of shares of our common stock pursuant to our plan of reorganization

,

including upon the conversion of AAL Preferred Stock and distributions from the disputed claims reserve established under the plan of reorganization upon the resolution of the underlying claims;

•

public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or issuances of our common stock upon the exercise or conversion of convertible securities, options, warrants, RSUs, SARs, or similar rights;

•

increases or decreases in reported holdings by insiders or other significant stockholders;

•

fluctuations in trading volume; and

•

changes in market values of airline companies as well as general market conditions.

Certain provisions of AAG's Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws) make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial.

Certain provisions of AAG's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following:

•

advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders’ meetings;

•

the ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on the board;

•

a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent;

•

a prohibition against stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders;

•

a requirement that holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors approve any amendment of our Bylaws submitted to stockholders for approval; and

•

super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation.

These provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the value of the interests of our stockholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable our board of directors to prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts


to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is approved by the board of directors prior to the investment under Section 203.

AAG's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.

AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include certain provisions that limit voting and ownership and disposition of our equity interests, including AAG Common Stock, AAG Series A Preferred Stock and convertible notes. See Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters - "

Ownership Restrictions."

These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our common stock and other equity interests to vote such interests and adversely affect the ability of persons to acquire shares of our common stock and other equity interests.

In order to protect AAG's NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes, AAG's Certificate of Incorporation includes certain limitations on acquisitions and dispositions of AAG's common stock, which may limit the liquidity of our common stock.

To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards and certain other tax attributes for federal income tax purposes, AAG's Certificate of Incorporation contains certain restrictions on the acquisition and disposition of AAG's common stock by substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG's common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of AAG's common stock. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an "ownership change" (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) from occurring, no assurance can be given that an ownership change will not occur even with these restrictions in place. See AAG's Restated Certificate of Incorporation which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto.

Ground Properties

At each airport where we conduct flight operations, we lease passenger, operations and baggage handling space, generally from the airport operator, but in some cases on a subleased basis from other airlines. Our main operational facilities are associated with our hubs. At those locations and in other cities we serve, we maintain administrative offices, terminal, catering, cargo, training facilities, maintenance facilities and other facilities, in each case as necessary to support our operations in the particular city.

We lease, or have built as leasehold improvements on leased property, most of our airport and terminal facilities in the U.S. and overseas, US Airways' corporate office building in Tempe, Arizona, our training facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, our principal overhaul and maintenance base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, our regional reservation offices, and local ticket and administration offices throughout the system. Our US Airways Operations Control Center is located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in a facility leased from the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

We own our corporate headquarters building in Fort Worth, Texas.

Terminal Construction Projects

We use public airports for our flight operations under lease or use arrangements with the municipalities or governmental agencies that own or control them and lease certain other ground equipment for use at such facilities. From time to time, airports undertake projects to improve or construct new facilities, which are typically funded through proceeds from special or general purpose bond offerings made by the respective airport governmental entity. Our airport lease and operating agreements typically provide that any costs for these new or improved airport facilities are passed through to us in the form of higher occupancy costs based on our relative percentage of occupancy at the airport. In certain circumstances, we agree to manage these airport projects.


American has entered into agreements with the Tulsa Municipal Airport Trust; the Alliance Airport Authority, Fort Worth, Texas; the New York City Industrial Development Agency; and the Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O’Hare, Newark, San Juan, and Los Angeles airport authorities pursuant to which such entities issued special facility revenue bonds, the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the cost of constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment which are leased by us. Prior to the Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into agreements with certain airport authorities pursuant to which such entities issued special facility revenue bonds, the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the cost of constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment leased by the Company. The special facility revenue bonds are non-recourse to the issuer. Pursuant to the Plan, claims relating to special facility revenue bonds in connection with Alliance Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport (certain bond issuances only), Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Chicago O’Hare, Newark Airport, and Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico were treated as general unsecured claims.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Chapter 11 Cases

. As previously disclosed, on the Petition Date, November 29, 2011, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order approving and confirming the Debtors' Plan. On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group, with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG. From the Petition Date through the Effective Date, pursuant to automatic stay provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and orders granted by the Bankruptcy Court, all actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors generally were stayed. Following the Effective Date, actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date, generally have been permanently enjoined. Any unresolved claims will continue to be subject to the claims reconciliation process under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court. However, certain pending litigation related to pre-petition liabilities may proceed in courts other than the Bankruptcy Court to the extent the parties to such litigation have obtained relief from the permanent injunction.

Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan has established a disputed claim reserve to hold shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and AAG Common Stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders that ultimately become allowed Single-Dip general unsecured claimholders after emergence. The shares provided for under the Plan are determined based upon a disputed claim reserve amount of approximately $755 million. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of the remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to AAG but rather will be distributed by priority first, if necessary, to satisfy unsecured claims or labor-related obligations, and then to former AMR shareholders as of the Effective Date. AAG is not required to distribute additional shares above the 756 million shares contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay all allowed unsecured claims. However, resolution of disputed claims could have a material effect on Single-Dip creditor recoveries under the Plan and the amount of additional share distributions, if any, that are made to former AMR shareholders as the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock that remain available for distribution upon resolution of disputed claims is limited pursuant to the Plan.

There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a determination that certain non-pension, post-employee benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be terminated without liability to American. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet ruled on this matter and we cannot predict whether American will receive relief from any of these obligations.

Government Antitrust Actions

. On August 13, 2013, the U.S. government, along with the States of Arizona, Florida, Tennessee and Texas, the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia (collectively, the plaintiff states), filed a complaint against US Airways Group and AMR in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the proposed Merger would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and sought to permanently enjoin the transaction. On September 5, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding the State of Michigan as a plaintiff. On October 1, 2013, the State of Texas entered into an agreement with US Airways Group and AMR that resolved that state’s objections to the Merger, and its claims were dismissed with prejudice on October 7, 2013. On November 11, 2013, US Airways and American entered into agreements with the U.S. government and the plaintiff states resolving all claims in the litigation. The agreement with the U.S. government requires the carriers to divest assets at certain airports and remains subject to public comment and court approval. In the agreement with the United States government, among other things, we agreed to divest and not reacquire for ten years certain rights and assets consisting of 52 Slot pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport, and 17 Slot pairs at LaGuardia, in each case together with and associated gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those Slot pairs, and two gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International


Airport. The agreement with the plaintiff states, which was entered by the court on November 12, 2013, requires our airlines, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, to maintain certain hub operations in a manner generally consistent with historical operations and to continue to provide scheduled daily service to certain specified communities, both for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from Washington Reagan National Airport

Merger Class Action

. On March 1, 2013, a complaint captioned Plumbers & Steamfitters Local Union No. 248 Pension Fund v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., No. CV2013-051605, was filed as a putative class action on behalf of the stockholders of US Airways Group in the Superior Court for Maricopa County, Arizona. On July 3, 2013, an amended complaint, captioned Dennis Palkon, et al. v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., No. CV2013-051605, was filed with the same court. The amended complaint names as defendants US Airways Group and the members of its board of directors, and alleges that the directors failed to maximize the value of US Airways Group in connection with the Merger and that US Airways Group aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duty. The relief sought in the amended complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or rescission in the event it has been consummated. The court in the above-referenced action denied the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order that had sought to enjoin the US Airways Group Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The above-referenced action was stayed pending the outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. government and various states on August 13, 2013 (described above). This stay has now been lifted and a motion to dismiss this action filed by US Airways Group is pending before the court. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.

Private Party Antitrust Action

. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint names as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, and alleges that the effect of the Merger may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. The relief sought in the complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants, and on October 2, 2013, dismissed the initial California action. The Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On January 10, 2014, the Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add a claim for money damages and to request injunctive relief requiring the carriers to hold separate their assets. Trial is set for June 2014. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.

US Airways Sabre Matter

. On April 21, 2011, US Airways Inc. filed an antitrust lawsuit against Sabre Holdings Corporation, Sabre Inc. and Sabre Travel International Limited (collectively, Sabre) in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit, as amended to date, alleges, among other things, that Sabre has engaged in anticompetitive practices to preserve its market power by restricting our ability to distribute our products to our customers. The lawsuit also alleges that these actions have permitted Sabre to charge supracompetitive booking fees and to use technologies that are not as robust and as efficient as alternatives in a competitive market. The lawsuit seeks both injunctive relief and money damages. Sabre filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the court denied in part and granted in part in September 2011 allowing two of the four counts in the complaint to proceed. We intend to pursue our claims against Sabre vigorously, but there can be no assurance of the outcome of this litigation.

General

. The Company and its subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within the control of the Company. Therefore, although the Company will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on the Company are uncertain.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

American Airlines Group

Background

As previously discussed, the Merger was consummated on December 9, 2013. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated results include American and American Eagle for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the results of US Airways Group for the 23 days ended December 31, 2013.

Following the Merger, AAG began moving toward operating under the single brand name of "American Airlines" through its mainline operations, American and US Airways. Until a single operating certificate is issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the operational integration is complete, American and US Airways will continue to operate as separate airlines. This process is expected to take 18-24 months. Through its operating subsidiaries, including the operating subsidiaries of US Airways Group, AAG is the largest airline in the world as measured by revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and available seat miles (ASMs). The Company has primary hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. As of

December 31, 2013

, the combined airline operated nearly

6,700

daily flights to


destinations in


countries. As of

December 31, 2013

, American and US Airways operated


mainline jets. American continues to be provided with regional feed by American Eagle and third-party regional carriers and US Airways continues to be provided with regional feed by Piedmont, PSA and third-party regional carriers. As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company’s regional subsidiaries and the third-party regional carriers that provide it with regional feed operated approximately


regional jets and approximately


turboprops.

See Part I, Item 1. Business -

"Chapter 11 Reorganization"

and "

Merger"

for more information related to our emergence from Chapter 11 and Merger.

Year in Review

The U.S. Airline Industry

In


, the U.S. airline industry experienced year-over-year growth in passenger revenues driven by strong demand for air travel.

In its most recent data available, Airlines for America, the trade association for U.S. airlines, reported that annual U.S. industry passenger revenues and yields increased 3.8% and 2.0%, respectively, as compared to 2012. With respect to international versus domestic performance, Airlines for America reported that the Atlantic and Latin America markets outperformed domestic markets in year-over-year growth in passenger revenues while the Pacific market experienced year-over-year declines in passenger revenues.

Throughout 2013, jet fuel prices continued to follow the price of Brent crude oil more closely than the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. On average, fuel costs were down slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012. The Brent crude oil average daily spot price was $109 in 2013 which approximates the average daily spot price in 2012. However, on a daily basis, prices continued to be volatile. Throughout 2013, daily spot prices fluctuated between a high of $119 per barrel in February to a low of $97 per barrel in April and closed the year at $110 per barrel on December 31, 2013.

While the U.S. airline industry is currently benefiting from a favorable revenue environment and moderating fuel prices as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the economic conditions driving these factors. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors -

"Downturns in economic conditions adversely affect our business"

and "

Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity."

American Airlines Group

In


, we realized operating income of

$1.4 billion

and a net

loss

of

$1.8 billion

. We completed our merger with US Airways Group on December 9, 2013, and accordingly these results include results of US Airways Group for the 23 day post-merger period, December 9, 2013, to December 31, 2013. The information in the following paragraph and under "Revenue", "Fuel", "Capacity" and "Cost Control" excludes the post-merger results of US Airways Group.


Excluding the results of US Airways Group, we recognized operating income of

$1.6 billion

in


which compares to operating income of

$148 million

in


, a

$1.4 billion

improvement

. This year-over-year improvement was driven by growth in operating revenues of

$957 million

resulting from strong demand for air travel and a

$471 million

reduction in operating expenses primarily as a result of steps taken in our Chapter 11 restructuring. Our standalone net

loss

was

$1.6 billion

in


which compares to a net loss of

$1.9 billion

in


. Our net

loss

was impacted by the recognition of net special charges of

$2.8 billion

and

$1.7 billion

in


and


, respectively, principally the result of reorganization expenses related to the recognition of allowed claims. See "

AAG's Results of Operations

" below for a reconciliation of the impact on American Airlines Group of the post-merger results of US Airways Group and net special charges.

Revenue

Mainline and regional passenger revenues

in

creased

$864 million

, or

4.0%

, as compared to


. The growth in revenues was driven by a

1.7%

in

crease in revenue passenger miles and a

2.3%

in

crease in yield, as total capacity

in

creased

1.3%

as compared to


. Our mainline and regional passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) was

13.38 cents

in


, a

2.7%

in

crease, as compared to

13.03 cents

in


.

Fuel

Mainline and regional fuel expense was relatively flat at

$8.7 billion

in each of


and


. The average mainline and regional price per gallon of fuel was

$3.09

in


as compared to an average price per gallon of

$3.20

in


, a

de

crease of

3.3%

. The decrease in fuel price per gallon was offset by a

3.1%

in

crease in consumption due in part to

in

creased capacity and a shift from turboprop to regional jet aircraft.

Capacity

Total system capacity for


increased

1.3%

primarily due to our ongoing fleet replacement programs where we are replacing older aircraft with larger gauge, more modern aircraft.

Cost Control

AAG is committed to maintaining a low cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel. Our mainline costs per available seat mile (CASM) excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing

de

creased

0.40 cents

or

4.5%

from

8.90 cents

in 2012 to

8.50 cents

in 2013. This

de

crease was primarily due to cost reductions achieved in our Chapter 11 restructuring to become more cost competitive.

The table below details our mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


:

(1)

We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and excluding special items and profit sharing provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.


Customer Service

We are committed to consistently deliver safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation. Our 2013 operating performance was negatively impacted by more severe summer weather conditions as compared to 2012. We reported the following operating statistics to the DOT for American's mainline operations for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


:

(a) Percentage of reported flight operations arriving on time as defined by the DOT.

(b) Percentage of scheduled flight operations completed.

(c) Rate of mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers.

(d) Rate of customer complaints filed with the DOT per 100,000 enplanements.

Liquidity Position

As of

December 31, 2013

, AAG's total cash and short-term investments was

$10.3 billion

, of which

$1.0 billion

was restricted. Additional detail is provided in the table below (in millions):

(1)

Our restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers' compensation obligations.

The improvement in our liquidity is due primarily to the acquisition of US Airways Group which had a cash and short-term investments balance of

$3.3 billion

at

December 31, 2013

as well as proceeds from our

$1.9 billion

Term Loan Facility, which we entered into in June 2013. We also obtained a

$1.0 billion

revolving credit facility. To date, we have not drawn any amounts under the revolving credit facility.

Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization and the related Merger Agreement, the Company issued a portion of its shares of common stock at emergence to certain employees. In December of 2013, the Company withheld the issuance of a portion of these shares and instead used approximately

$300 million

of cash in satisfaction of employee tax obligations.

As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

$783 million

of our cash and short-term investments balances were held in foreign bank accounts, of which

$710 million

was held as Venezuela bolivars.

The business environment in Venezuela has been challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluation, high inflation and governmental restrictions, including currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

$710 million

of our unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars, valued at a weighted average rate of 6.04 bolivars to the dollar. The period of time to exchange those funds into dollars and repatriate them has been increasing and is presently more than a year. On January 23, 2014, the Venezuelan government issued a regulation to implement a new system for determining the exchange rate based on the result of limited periodic sales of dollars known as Sicad auctions (currently 11.80 to the dollar based on the February 21, 2014 Sicad auction) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of conversion and repatriation of local currency. The government also enacted a new law effective February 19, 2014 that authorizes additional methods of exchanging Venezuelan bolivars at rates other than the controlled base rate of 6.3 to the dollar or the existing Sicad auction rate, but the regulations necessary to implement the law are still pending and it is not clear at this point whether or how the new methods may impact the pending balances of Venezuelan bolivars held by airlines. We are working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local


currency. Further, the current, devalued rates may have an ongoing adverse effect on our reported results if we are unable to fully adjust prices on flights to and from Venezuela, of which there can be no assurance. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors "

We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control"

for additional discussion on currency risks.

2014 Outlook

We have taken significant actions in the last year, including the completion of our restructuring and merger with US Airways Group, to restore our competitiveness. Although it is difficult to predict the price of oil or the strength of the economy, we believe that our 2013 financial results are evidence of the strong foundation we have in place and can build on.


AAG's Results of Operations

In


, we realized operating income of

$1.4 billion

and a net

loss

of

$1.8 billion

. We completed our merger with US Airways Group on December 9, 2013, and accordingly the results of US Airways Group are included for the 23 day post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Excluding the results of US Airways Group, we recognized operating income of

$1.6 billion

and a net

loss

of

$1.6 billion

. Excluding the effects of net special items we recognized standalone net income of

$1.2 billion

. In


we experienced growth in revenues due to the strong demand for air travel and a reduction in operating costs as a result of steps taken in our Chapter 11 restructuring.

In


, we realized operating income of

$148 million

and a net

loss

of

$1.9 billion

. Excluding the effects of net special items we recognized a net loss of

$130 million

.

In


, we realized an operating loss of

$1.0 billion

and a net

loss

of

$2.0 billion

. Excluding the effects of net special items we recognized a net loss of

$1.1 billion

. We filed for Chapter 11 on November 29, 2011.

The following table presents our 2013 standalone Operating income (loss), Net loss, net special charges and net income excluding special charges:

(1)

To conform to current year presentation, certain operating revenue and expenses in prior years have been reclassified. As a result, prior year amounts may not agree to the amounts previously reported. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information.

(2)

We are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors the ability to measure financial performance excluding special items, which is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines.

The components of our net special charges, excluding the results of US Airways Group for the 23 day post-merger period, are as follows (in millions):

(1)

In


, special charges consisted primarily of a

$107 million

charge related to the American's pilot long-term disability obligation,

$58 million

in severance and professional fees,

$56 million

related to employee awards granted in connection with the Merger, a

$43 million

charge for workers' compensation claims, and a

$33 million

impairment charge associated with certain Boeing 757 aircraft held for sale. These charges were offset in part by a

$67 million

gain on the sale of slots at LaGuardia Airport as a result of the settlement reached with the DOJ and a

$31 million

credit resulting from the modification of American's AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank.

In


, special charges consisted of

$387 million

of severance and related charges and write-off of leasehold improvements on aircraft and airport facilities that were rejected during the Chapter 11 process.

In


, special charges consisted primarily of

$725 million

related to the impairment of certain aircraft and gates,

$31 million

of non-cash charges related to certain sale/leaseback transactions, and a

$43 million

revenue reduction as a result of a decrease in the breakage assumption related to the AAdvantage frequent flyer liability.


(2)

In


, special charges consisted of interest charges of

$157 million

to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan, a

$54 million

charge related to the premium on tender for existing secured notes and EETC financings and the write-off of debt issuance costs and

$19 million

in charges related to the repayment of existing secured notes and EETC financings.

In


, special charges consisted of a

$280 million

benefit resulting from a settlement of a commercial dispute.

(3)

In


and


, special charges included, respectively, a

$538 million

and a

$569 million

non-cash income tax benefit from continuing operations. The Company is required to consider all items (including items recorded in other comprehensive income) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the year, which was exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders' equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, the Company's year-end net deferred tax position is not impacted by this tax allocation. The


tax benefit was offset in part by a

$214 million

tax charge attributable to additional valuation allowance required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.

Compared to


Operating Revenues

The following discussion of operating revenues is for AAG on a standalone basis and excludes the results of US Airways Group for the post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013 in order to make the year-over-year comparison more meaningful.

Total operating revenues in


were

$25.8 billion

as compared to

$24.9 billion

, primarily due to increased revenues associated with the sale of AAdvantage frequent flyer mileage credits and a

$31 million

special credit related to a change in accounting method resulting from the modification of the Company's AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank.

We derived approximately

60%

of our total passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately

40%

from international operations (flights serving international destinations). Additional information regarding our domestic and international PRASM and capacity, excluding the impact of the Merger, is presented below:


Operating Expenses

The following discussion of operating expenses and mainline operating expenses per ASM is for AAG on a standalone basis and excludes the results of US Airways Group for the post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013 in order to make the year-over-year comparison more meaningful.

Total operating expenses in


were

$24.2 billion

as compared to

$24.7 billion

in


,

a de

crease of

$471 million

, or

1.9%

. The

de

crease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a

$941 million

, or

15.1%

de

crease in salaries, wages and benefits due to the results of voluntary and involuntary terminations in connection with the 2012 restructuring plan as well as effects related to the freezing of American's pension plans in 2012. This decrease was offset in part by a

$190 million

, or

34.4%

in

crease in aircraft rent as a result of new aircraft deliveries in 2013 as we continue our fleet renewal program, a

$69 million

, or

6.5%

in

crease in selling expenses due to higher passenger revenues and other operating expenses, which

in

creased

$225 million

, or

8.4%

, primarily due to higher costs associated with outsourced services and enhanced customer product offerings. See detailed explanations below relating to other changes in operating expenses.


Mainline Operating Expenses per ASM:

Our mainline CASM, excluding the results of US Airways Group for the post-merger period,

de

creased

0.53 cents

, or

3.7%

, from

8.90 cents

in


to

8.50 cents

in


, while mainline capacity

in

creased

1.2%

.

The table below sets forth the major components of our total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


:

(1)

We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and excluding special items and profit sharing provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expense per ASM are as follows:

•

Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM

de

creased

2.2%

primarily due to a

3.2%

de

crease in the average price per gallon of fuel, net of the effects of hedging, to

$3.10

in


from

$3.20

in


, which was offset in part by an increase in gallons consumed.

•

Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM

de

creased

16.2%

primarily due to the results of voluntary and involuntary terminations in connection with the 2012 restructuring plan as well as effects related to the freezing of American's pension plan in 2012.

•

Aircraft rent per ASM

in

creased

33.3%

as a result of new aircraft deliveries in 2013 as we continue our fleet renewal program.

•

Selling expenses per ASM

in

creased

5.8%

as a result of higher commissions and credit card fees related to the increase in passenger revenues.

•

Other operating expenses per ASM

in

creased

7.4%

due to increases in outsourced services, costs associated with enhanced customer product offerings.

Regional Operating Expenses:

Total regional expenses

in

creased

$84 million

, or

2.8%

, in


to

$3.1 billion

from

$3.0 billion

in


. The year-over-year

in

crease was primarily driven by a

$44 million

, or

4.4%

,

in

crease in fuel costs and a

$40 million

, or

2.0%

in

crease in other costs on a

1.8%

in

crease in capacity. The increase in fuel costs was driven by higher fuel consumption due to the transition from turboprop to regional jet aircraft.


Nonoperating Income (Expense)

The following discussion of interest expense is for AAG on a standalone basis and excludes the results of US Airways Group for the post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013 in order to make the year-over-year comparison more meaningful.

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest

in

creased

$204 million

, or

32.3%

, to

$836 million

in


from

$632 million

in


primarily due to special charges of

$157 million

to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan.

Other nonoperating expense, net of

$89 million

in


consists principally of net foreign currency losses of

$56 million

. Other nonoperating income in


consisted principally of a

$280 million

special credit related to the settlement of a commercial dispute partially offset by net foreign currency losses.

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases, which were filed in November of 2011. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on AAG's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


(in millions):

(1)

In exchange for employees' contributions to the successful reorganization of the Company, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, the Company agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that group through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain work rule changes. The total value of this deemed claim was approximately

$1.7 billion

.

(2)

Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information.

(3)

Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended

December 31, 2013

, the Company recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of

$180 million

, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.


(4)

The Plan allows unsecured creditors receiving Preferred Stock a conversion discount of

3.5%

. Accordingly, the Company recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court.

Income Tax Benefit

During


, the Company generated a pre-tax loss of approximately

$2.2 billion

and other comprehensive income before tax of approximately

$1.5 billion

. In accordance with accounting standards, the Company must record a net zero tax provision which is required to be allocated between operating loss and Accumulated other comprehensive income. Application of this guidance required the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of

$538 million

in operating results, offset by a

$538 million

charge to other comprehensive income for the year. See Note


to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information regarding the allocation of income tax benefit to Operating income and Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded a similar non-cash income tax benefit of

$569 million

in operating results in


, offset by a

$569 million

charge to other comprehensive income for the year, as discussed in Note


to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A.

The Company has evaluated the realization of its deferred tax assets in accordance with the principles provided in ASC 740. In connection with AMR’s fourth quarter 2013 emergence from bankruptcy and related accounting for the acquisition of US Airways, the Company determined that an additional valuation allowance of approximately

$214 million

is required to reduce the Company’s deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes to be more likely than not to be realized. This

$214 million

results in a charge to tax expense in continuing operations for the period. The Company’s assessment of the realization of its deferred tax assets is based primarily on the future reversal of its existing taxable temporary differences. The Company is not relying on projections of future income for the realization of deferred tax assets. See Note


to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information regarding deferred taxes.

The Company has also recorded an income tax expense credit of approximately

$22 million

in


resulting from the Company’s anticipated election under Section 3081 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012), allowing corporations a refund of certain research and alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.

Total operating revenues in


were

$24.9 billion

as compared to

$24.0 billion

•

Mainline passenger revenues

in

creased

4.4%

to

$18.7 billion

in


as compared to

$17.9 billion

of passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately

40%

from international operations (flights serving international destinations). Additional information regarding our domestic and international RASM and capacity is presented below:

and


:

(1)

We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and excluding special items and profit sharing provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expense per ASM are as follows:

•

Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM

in

creased

5.9%

primarily due to a

6.3%

increase in the average price per gallon of fuel, net of the effects of hedging, to

$3.20

•

Maintenance, materials and repairs per ASM

in

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases, which were filed in November of 2011. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on AAG's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


(in millions):

(1)

Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information.

Income Tax Benefit

During


, the Company generated a pre-tax loss of approximately

$2.4 billion

and other comprehensive income before tax of approximately

$1.6 billion

. In accordance with accounting standards, the Company's net zero tax provision is required to be allocated between operating loss and accumulated other comprehensive income. Application of this guidance required the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of

$569 million

in operating results, offset by a

$569 million

charge to other comprehensive income for the year. See Note


to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information regarding the allocation of income tax benefit to Operating income and Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company did not record a net tax provision (benefit) associated with its net loss for


due to the Company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in Note


to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A.


American's Results of Operations

In


, American recognized operating income of

$1.5 billion

, which compares to operating income of

$82 million

in


and constitutes a

$1.5 billion

improvement

that was driven by growth in operating revenues resulting from strong demand for air travel. American's net

loss

was

$1.5 billion

in


which compares to a net

loss

of

$1.9 billion

in


. American's net

loss

was impacted by the recognition of net special charges of

$2.8 billion

and

$1.7 billion

in


and


, respectively. To conform to current year presentation, certain operating revenues and expenses in prior years have been reclassified. As a result, prior year amounts may not agree to the amounts previously reported. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information.

In


, American realized an operating loss of

$1.2 billion

and a net

loss

of

$2.0 billion

. American's


net

loss

was impacted by the recognition of

$915 million

in net special charges.

The table below presents American's net special charges (in millions):

(1)

In


, special charges consisted primarily of a

$107 million

charge related to American's pilot long-term disability obligation,

$47 million

in severance and professional fees,

$56 million

related to employee awards granted in connection with the Merger, a

$43 million

charge for workers' compensation claims, and a

$33 million

impairment charge associated with certain Boeing 757 aircraft held for sale. These charges were offset in part by a

$67 million

gain on the sale of slots at LaGuardia Airport as a result of the settlement reached with the DOJ and a

$31 million

credit related to a change in accounting method resulting from the modification of American's AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank.

In


, special charges consisted of

$386 million

of severance and related charges and write-off of leasehold improvements on aircraft and airport facilities that were rejected during the Chapter 11 process.

In


, special charges and other items consisted primarily of

$725 million

related to the impairment of certain aircraft and gates,

$31 million

of non-cash charges related to certain sale/leaseback transactions, and a

$43 million

revenue reduction as a result of a decrease in the breakage assumption related to the AAdvantage frequent flyer liability.

(2)

In


, special charges consisted of interest charges of

$68 million

to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan, a

$54 million

charge related to the premium on tender for existing EETC financings and the write-off of debt issuance costs and

$19 million

in charges related to the repayment of existing EETC financings.

In


, special charges consisted of a

$280 million

benefit resulting from a settlement of a commercial dispute.

(3)

In


and


, special charges included, respectively, a

$538 million

and a

$569 million

non-cash income tax benefit from continuing operations. American is required to consider all items (including items recorded in other comprehensive income) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, American recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the year, which was exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholder's equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, American's year-end net deferred tax position is not impacted by this tax allocation. The


tax benefit was offset in part by a

$214 million

tax charge attributable to additional valuation allowance required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.

$24.2 billion

as compared to

$24.7 billion

in

a de

crease of

$517 million

or

2.1%

. The

de

crease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a

$941 million

, or

15.2%

de

crease in salaries, wages and benefits due to the results of voluntary and involuntary terminations in connection with the 2012 restructuring plan, as well as effects related to the freezing of American's pension plan in 2012. This decrease was offset in part by a

$189 million

34.2%

in

crease in aircraft rent as a result of new aircraft deliveries in 2013 as American continues its fleet renewal program, a

$69 million

, or

in


. The year-over-year

in

crease was primarily driven by a

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest

in

creased

$67 million

, or

10.6%

to

$700 million

in


consists principally of net foreign currency losses of

$55 million

. Other nonoperating income in


consisted principally of a

$280 million

special credit related to the settlement of a commercial dispute partially offset by net foreign currency losses.


Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases, which were filed in November of 2011. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on American's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


(in millions):

(1)

In exchange for employees' contributions to the successful reorganization of the Company, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, the Company agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that group through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain work rule changes. The total value of this deemed claim was approximately

$1.7 billion

.

(2)

Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.

(3)

Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended

December 31, 2013

, American recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of

$180 million

, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.

(4)

The Plan allows unsecured creditors receiving Preferred Stock a conversion discount of

3.5%

. Accordingly, American recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court.

Income Tax Benefit

During


, American generated a pre-tax loss of approximately

$1.9 billion

and other comprehensive income before tax of approximately

$1.5 billion

. In accordance with accounting standards, American must record a net zero tax provision which is required to be allocated between operating loss and accumulated other comprehensive income. Application of this guidance required the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of

$538 million

in operating results, offset by a

$538 million

charge to other comprehensive income for the year. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding the allocation of income tax benefit to Operating income and Accumulated other comprehensive income. American recorded a similar non-cash income tax benefit of

$569 million

in operating results for


, offset by a

$569 million

charge to other comprehensive income for the year, as discussed in Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.

American has evaluated the realization of its deferred tax assets in accordance with the principles provided in ASC 740. In connection with AMR’s fourth quarter emergence 2013 from bankruptcy and related accounting for the acquisition of US Airways, American determined that an additional valuation allowance of approximately

$214 million

is required to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes to be more likely than not to be realized. This

$214 million

results in a charge to tax expense in continuing operations for the period. American’s assessment of the realization of its deferred tax assets is based primarily on the future reversal of American's existing taxable temporary differences. American is not relying on projections of


future income for the realization of deferred tax assets. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding deferred taxes.

American has also recorded an income tax expense credit of approximately

$30 million

in


resulting from its anticipated election under Section 3081 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012), allowing corporations a refund of certain research and alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Assets

As of

December 31, 2013

, AAG's total cash, short-term investments and restricted cash and short-term investments was

$10.3 billion

, of which

$1.0 billion

was restricted. This includes American's total cash and short-term investments of

$6.7 billion

(

$702 million

restricted) and US Airways Group's cash and short-term investments of

$3.6 billion

(

$333 million

restricted). Additional detail is provided in the table below (in millions):

(1)

Our restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers compensation obligations.

As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

$783 million

of American's cash and short-term investments balances were held in foreign bank accounts, of which

$710 million

is held as Venezuela bolivars.

The business environment in Venezuela has been challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluation, high inflation and governmental restrictions, including currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

$710 million

of our unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars, valued at a weighted average rate of 6.04 bolivars to the dollar. The period of time to exchange those funds into dollars and repatriate them has been increasing and is presently more than a year. On January 23, 2014, the Venezuelan government issued a regulation to implement a new system for determining the exchange rate based on the result of limited periodic sales of dollars known as Sicad auctions (currently 11.80 to the dollar based on the February 21, 2014 Sicad auction) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of conversion and repatriation of local currency. The government also enacted a new law effective February 19, 2014 that authorizes additional methods of exchanging Venezuelan bolivars at rates other than the controlled base rate of 6.3 to the dollar or the existing Sicad auction rate, but the regulations necessary to implement the law are still pending and it is not clear at this point whether or how the new methods may impact the pending balances of Venezuelan bolivars held by airlines. We are working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. Further, the current, devalued rates may have an ongoing adverse effect on our reported results if we are unable to fully adjust prices on flights to and from Venezuela, of which there can be no assurance. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors "

We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control"

for additional discussion on currency risks.

Our unrestricted short-term investment portfolio consists of a variety of what we believe are highly liquid, lower risk instruments including money market funds, government agency investments, repurchase agreements, short-term obligations, corporate obligations, bank notes, certificates of deposit and time deposits. Our objectives for our investment portfolio are (1) the safety of principal, (2) liquidity maintenance, (3) yield maximization and (4) the full investment of all available funds. Our risk management policy further emphasizes superior credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining investments in our portfolio and enforce limits on the proportion of funds invested with one issuer, one industry or one type of instrument. We regularly assess the market risks of our portfolio.



Sources and Uses of Cash

AAG

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was

$675 million

and

$1.3 billion

in


and


, respectively, a year-over-year

de

crease of

$610 million

. This year-over-year

de

crease was primarily due to the inclusion of US Airways Group's net cash used in operating activities of $327 million, for the post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013, and our emergence from bankruptcy in 2013 which triggered cash payments for certain liabilities.

Commitments

Significant Indebtedness

As of

December 31, 2013

, AAG and American had

$16.8 billion

and

$10.8 billion

, respectively, in long-term debt and capital leases (including current maturities and before debt discount). Our significant indebtedness includes the following agreements:

Credit Facilities (American)

On June 27, 2013, American and AAG entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with certain lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a

$1.9 billion

term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) and a

$1.0 billion

revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities). As of

December 31, 2013

, American had borrowed

$1.9 billion

under the Term Loan Facility. The Credit Facilities are secured obligations of American and guaranteed by AAG. The Revolving Facility provides that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder and have letters of credit issued thereunder in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of up to

$1.0 billion

. As of

December 31, 2013

, there were

no

borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

Upon consummation of the Merger, US Airways Group and US Airways joined the Credit Facilities as guarantors. Following the joinder, certain minimum dollar-thresholds under the negative and financial covenants in the Credit Facilities were automatically increased. The Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility mature on June 27, 2019 and June 27, 2018, respectively, unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties. The Term Loan Facility is repayable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to

0.25%

of the original principal amount thereof with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility.

Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time, with a premium of

1.00%

applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following December 27, 2013. Mandatory prepayments at par of term loans and revolving loans are required to the extent necessary to comply with American's covenants regarding the collateral coverage ratio and certain dispositions of collateral. In addition, if a "change of control" (as defined in the Credit Agreement) occurs, American will, absent an amendment or waiver, be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities and terminate the Revolving Facility.

The Credit Facilities bear interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at American's option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of

0.75%

, with respect to the Term Loan) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is

3.00%

for borrowings under both the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Credit Facilities are secured by certain collateral, including liens on certain route authorities to operate between certain specified cities, certain take-off and landing rights at certain airports and American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities as more fully described below in "

Collateral Related Covenants

".

The Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross default to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Credit Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. The Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the Credit Facilities) of not less than

$2.0 billion

, and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional



indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.

Senior Secured Notes (American)

In March 2011, American issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2016 (the Senior Secured Notes) guaranteed on an unsecured basis by AAG. In connection with the closing of the Merger, US Airways and US Airways Group entered into a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 9, 2013, pursuant to which US Airways and US Airways Group became guarantors. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of

7.50%

per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2011. As is customary for financings of this nature, the indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of events of default under the related indenture. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes are secured by certain route authorities, airport landing and takeoff slots, and rights to use or occupy space in airport terminals, in each case that American uses to operate non-stop services between certain airports and American is required maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding amounts under the Senior Secured Notes as more fully described below in "Collateral Related Covenants."

American, at its option, may redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2013, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time prior to March 15, 2014, American, at its option, may redeem (1) up to

35%

of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of

107.5%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and (2) during any 12-month period, up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of

103%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If American sells certain assets or if a "change of control" (as defined in the indenture) occurs, American must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at prices specified in the indenture.

The indenture for the Senior Secured Notes includes covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends. The indenture for the Senior Secured Notes also contains events of default customary for similar financings, including cross-default to certain material indebtedness of American. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated and become due and payable.

2013 Citicorp Credit Facility (US Airways)

US Airways Group and certain other subsidiaries of US Airways Group are guarantors of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement dated as of May 23, 2013. In connection with the closing of the Merger, AAG and American entered into a joinder to the 2013 Citicorp credit facility loan agreement pursuant to which AAG and American became guarantors under such agreement.

The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility consists of $1.0 billion of tranche B-1 term loans (Tranche B-1) and

$600 million

of tranche B-2 term loans (Tranche B-2). Voluntary prepayments may be made by US Airways Group at any time, with a premium of

1.00%

applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following January 16, 2014. Mandatory prepayments of the term loans are required to the extent necessary to comply with US Airways Group’s covenants regarding the collateral coverage ratio and certain dispositions of collateral. In addition, under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement, if a "change of control" (as defined in the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement) occurs, US Airways will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay the outstanding loans in full together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment.

As of the date of this filing, the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility bears interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at US Airways' option, LIBOR (subject to a of

0.75%

) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is

2.75%

for Tranche B-1 and

2.25%

for Tranche B-2.

Tranche B-1 and Tranche B-2 mature on May 23, 2019 and November 23, 2016, respectively (unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties), and each is repayable in annual installments to be paid on each anniversary of the closing date in an amount equal to

1.00%

of the initial aggregate principal amount of the loans with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the respective tranche.

The obligations of US Airways under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility are secured by liens on certain route authorities, certain take-off and landing rights at certain airports and certain other assets of US Airways. US Airways is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility as more fully described below in "

Collateral Related Covenants.

"



The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, (a) require AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain unrestricted liquidity of not less than

$2.0 billion

, with not less than

$750 million

held in accounts subject to control agreements, and (b) restrict the ability of US Airways Group, its subsidiaries party to the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, AAG and American to make certain investments, pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain acquisitions, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into certain hedging transactions, and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement contains events of default customary for similar financings, including a cross-default provision to certain other material indebtedness of US Airways and certain of its affiliates. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately.

See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on all indebtedness as of

December 31, 2013

.

Collateral Related Covenants

Certain of American's and US Airways’ debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require American and US Airways under their respective financing agreements to periodically appraise the collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, American or US Airways is required, as applicable, to subject additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part, with premium (if any), or pay additional interest on the related indebtedness, as described below.

Specifically, American is required to meet certain collateral coverage tests on a periodic basis on two financing transactions: (1) the Senior Secured Notes and (2) the Credit Facilities, and US Airways is required to meet a collateral coverage test on a periodic basis on the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, in each case, as described below:

(1)

With respect to spare parts, one physical appraisal and one desktop appraisal are required in each fiscal year.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company, American and US Airways were in compliance with the most recently completed collateral coverage test for the Senior Secured Notes, Credit Facilities and the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, as applicable.



Credit Ratings

The following table details our credit ratings as of

December 31, 2013

:

*

The credit agency does not rate this category for the respective entity.

A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would increase our interest expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which could negatively impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on all indebtedness as of

December 31, 2013

Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments

We have definitive purchase agreements with Airbus, Boeing and other manufacturers for the acquisition of an aggregate of


mainline and regional aircraft. We also have agreements for


spare engines to be delivered in 2014 and beyond. Under all of our aircraft and engine purchase agreements, our total future commitments as of

December 31, 2013

are expected to be as follows (approximately, in millions):

(1)

These amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturers and include all commitments for regional aircraft. American has granted Boeing a security interest in American's purchase deposits with Boeing. The Company's purchase deposits totaled

$1.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2013

.

We do not have financing commitments for the following aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered through 2016:

sixteen

Airbus 320 family aircraft,


Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and


Boeing 787 aircraft. In addition, we do not have financing commitments in place for the majority of aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2017 and beyond. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - "

We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully

."

Credit Card Processing and Other Reserves

We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because, although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to us soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time, and the processor may have liability if we do not ultimately provide the air travel. Our agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a "holdback") equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. Certain of our agreements provide that these holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the processing companies, up to the estimated liability for future air travel purchased with the respective credit cards, upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. The amount that the processing companies may withhold also varies as a result of changes in financial risk due to seasonal fluctuations in ticket volume. Additional holdback requirements will reduce our liquidity in the form of unrestricted cash by the amount of the holdbacks.



Pension Funding Obligation

We are required to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of ERISA, the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Pension Relief Act of 2010, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012. In 2013 we contributed

$489 million

to our defined benefit pension plans, which covered minimum contributions for periods prior to our Chapter 11 filing and periods thereafter (see Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 2 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information), as well as certain interest and penalty interest due with respect to contributions for pre-petition periods.

American's minimum required contribution to our pension plans for


is

$120 million

. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Upon expiration of these rules, our funding obligations are likely to increase materially.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed in Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8A and Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8B of this report.

Special Facility Revenue Bonds

Certain special facility revenue bonds were issued by certain municipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased by American and accounted for as operating leases. In accordance with various orders of the Bankruptcy Court and/or the Plan, special facility revenue bond claims in connection with the Alliance Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, and certain special revenue bond claims in relation to the John F. Kennedy International Airport were treated as general unsecured claims. In addition, pursuant to the Plan, the agreements with respect to the special facility revenue bonds relating to the Tulsa International Airport have remained in full force and effect, in accordance with their original terms and conditions, and constitute ongoing obligations of American or AAG, as reflected in the particular agreement. Approximately

$498 million

of the special facility revenue bonds (with total future payments of approximately

$715 million

as of

December 31, 2013

) are guaranteed by AAG, American, US Airways Group or US Airways. Approximately

$112 million

of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the bonds in 2014. Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling accruals or are considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments.

Pass-Through Trusts

We have financed certain aircraft and engines with pass-through trust certificates, or enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs), issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance our acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American and US Airways to raise the financing for several aircraft at one time and place such funds in escrow pending the purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American and US Airways.

Each trust covered a set amount of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced within a specific period of time. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the funds in escrow to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes were issued, at American or US Airways' election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leased the aircraft to American or US Airways. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of,



nor are they guaranteed by, AAG, American, US Airways Group or US Airways. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American or US Airways and, in certain instances, are guaranteed by AAG or US Airways Group as applicable. As of

December 31, 2013

,

$6.0 billion

associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

With respect to leveraged leases, American or US Airways evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American or US Airways concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American and US Airways generally are not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American or US Airways to absorb decreases in value or entitles American or US Airways to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American and US Airways do not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Each lease does have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American or US Airways to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term; the fixed price approximates an estimate of the aircraft's fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American and US Airways do not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American and US Airways concluded it was not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American and US Airways account for their EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American and US Airways' total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are

$2.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2013

.

Income Taxes

We experienced a statutory "ownership change" on December 9, 2013 as defined for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. When a company undergoes such an ownership change, Section 382 limits the company’s future ability to utilize any NOL generated before the ownership change and certain subsequently recognized "built-in" losses and deductions, if any, existing as of the date of the ownership change. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where an ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We anticipate taking advantage of these certain special rules which will permit approximately

$9.0 billion

of our federal NOL carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. At December 31, 2013, the Company inherited the US Airways Group approximate

$1.6 billion

of NOLs (

$1.4 billion

of which is subject to Section 382 limitation due to the ownership change) to reduce the Company’s future taxable income. The majority of American Airlines Group Inc.’s NOLs are expected to be available to reduce federal taxable income in the calendar year 2014. The Company’s ability to utilize any new NOL arising after the ownership change is not affected.


AAG Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes AAG's obligations and commitments as of

December 31, 2013

. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time.

(3)

Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities—which are supported by operating leases executed by American or US Airways—are guaranteed by AAG, US Airways Group, American and/or US Airways. The special facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions discussed above are included in this table based on lease payment terms rather than their mandatory tender provision date. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information.

(4)

See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information about the Company's obligations.

(5)

Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with the Company's third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information.

(6)

Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily information technology related support. The Company has made estimates as to the timing of certain payments primarily for construction related costs. The actual timing of payments may vary from these estimates. Substantially all of the Company's purchase orders issued for other purchases in the ordinary course of business contain a 30-day cancellation clause that allows the Company to cancel an order with 30 days notice.

(7)

Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and other postretirement benefit payments based on estimated payments through 2023. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A.

(8)

Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts that represent a variable expense (based on levels of operation) or where short-term cancellation provisions exist.

Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions

In light of AAG’s significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft and the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, AAG and its subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks and natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, aircraft and aircraft engines and parts could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, the Credit Facilities, the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility and certain of our other financing arrangements


contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements.

In the past, the Company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash position and other considerations, the Company may continue to take such actions.

We have reserved shares of AAG Common Stock and Preferred Stock to be distributed to holders of unsecured claims that were not settled prior to emergence and have not yet been resolved.

Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities—which are supported by operating leases executed by American—are guaranteed by AAG and/or American. The special facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions discussed above are included in this table based on lease payment terms rather than their mandatory tender provision date.

Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with American's third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information.

(6)

Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily information technology related support. American has made estimates as to the timing of certain payments primarily for construction related costs. The actual timing of payments may vary from these estimates. Substantially all of American's purchase orders issued for other purchases in the ordinary course of business contain a 30-day cancellation clause that allows American to cancel an order with 30 days notice.

(7)

Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and other postretirement benefit payments based on estimated payments through 2023. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.

(8)

Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts that represent a variable expense (based on levels of operation) or where short-term cancellation provisions exist.

In light of American's significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft and the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, American will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks and natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, aircraft and aircraft engines and parts could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, American's Credit and Guaranty Agreement and certain of our other financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements.


In the past, American has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash position and other considerations, the American may continue to take such actions.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.

Passenger revenue

Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. AAG's air traffic liability was

$4.4 billion

and

$2.8 billion

as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively and American's air traffic liability was

$3.1 billion

and

$2.8 billion

as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.

The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel was to be provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in results of operations during the period in which the evaluations are completed.

Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets consist of flight equipment along with other fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets such as certain domestic take-off and landing rights, customer relationships, marketing agreements and tradenames. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Amortizing intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.

We record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of future market and operating conditions, including our current fleet plan and considerations of any modifications thereto. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.


The majority of American's and US Airways' fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan, including positive or negative developments in the areas described above. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if we replaced the aircraft.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually on October 1

st

or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate. We have one consolidated reporting unit.

Goodwill is measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative screen and, if necessary, then comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. As AAG acquired US Airways on December 9, 2013, an impairment test was unnecessary in 2013 as no events or circumstances were identified to indicate the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain international and domestic take-off and landing rights. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested for impairment annually on October 1

st

or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate. Indefinite-lived assets are measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative screen and, if necessary, then comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. The fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily based on available market pricing for comparable assets along with estimates of discounted future cash flows, using assumptions based on historical results adjusted to reflect management's best estimate of future market and operating conditions. Changes in industry capacity, demand for air transportation, regulatory considerations such as "open skies" arrangements, and other factors can significantly impact the fair value of our indefinite-lived assets. Based upon our annual testing, there were no impairments of indefinite-lived assets in 2013.

Business Combination Measurements

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we estimated the fair value of US Airways’ assets and liabilities as of the closing date of the Merger, December 9. 2013. These fair value adjustments did not result in gains or losses, but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us in the Merger. Additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values, as well as changes in other assumptions could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill.

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income and cost approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, other than certain long-term debt assumed in the Merger. The market approach, which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets, was utilized to estimate the fair value of US Airways’ aircraft and operating leases. The market approach used includes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets, as well as pricing guides and other sources. We considered the current market for the aircraft, the maintenance condition of the aircraft and the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets, among other factors. We also utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take-off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available. The income approach was primarily used to value intangible assets, including customer relationships, marketing agreements, certain international route authorities, and the US Airways tradename. The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for certain assets for which the market and income approaches could not be applied due to the nature of the asset. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. The fair value of the Dividend Miles frequent flyer program liability was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of outstanding miles which were expected to be redeemed at December 9, 2013. The weighted average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service, domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel.


Frequent flyer programs

AAG currently operates two frequent traveler programs, American's AAdvantage and US Airways' Dividend Miles. These programs award mileage credits to passengers who fly on American and oneworld carriers and US Airways and Star Alliance carriers, respectively, as well as certain other partner airlines that participate in the programs. Effective March 31, 2014, US Airways will join the oneworld alliance and exit the Star Alliance. At that point, frequent travel reciprocity will be discontinued for many Star Alliance airlines. Mileage credits can also be earned through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in our respective loyalty programs. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American, US Airways or other participating partner airlines, in which case we pay a fee.

We use the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members earn mileage credits by flying on American, US Airways or our regional affiliates. We have an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore have recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.

The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level required to redeem an award. Additionally, outstanding mileage credits are subject to expiration if unused. In calculating the liability, we estimate how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and exclude those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These estimates are based on historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the statement of operations as a part of passenger revenue.

The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. Incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food, and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. In addition, we also include in the determination of incremental cost the amount of certain fees related to redemptions expected to be collected from AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members. These redemption fees reduce incremental cost. No profit or overhead margin is included in the accrual of incremental cost. These estimates are generally updated based upon our 12-month historical average of such costs.

We applied the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Merger and therefore recorded the liability for outstanding US Airways mileage credits at fair value, an amount significantly in excess of incremental cost. As of

December 31, 2013

, the liability for outstanding mileage credits expected to be redeemed for future travel awards for US Airways under the Dividend Miles program was

$932 million

and is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Frequent flyer liability. This liability will be reduced as miles are redeemed and new miles earned will be recorded as a liability based on the incremental cost method discussed above.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the liability for outstanding mileage credits for the AAdvantage program was

$580 million

and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within frequent flyer liability.

American and US Airways also sell frequent flyer program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to business partners is comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. Historically, we have used the residual method of accounting to determine the values of each component as there had not been a material modification to any significant agreements since our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" on January 1, 2011.

During the fourth quarter, American and Citibank amended their current agreement which resulted in a material modification of the terms of the arrangement. Also, in connection with our acquisition of US Airways on December 9, 2013, a material modification occurred on all of US Airways' agreements in connection with the Merger. Therefore, subsequent to the amendments of these arrangements, we will apply the relative selling price method to determine the values of each deliverable. Under the relative selling price approach, we identified five revenue elements for the co-branded credit card agreements with Citibank and Barclays: the transportation component; use of the American and US Airways’ brand including access to frequent flyer member lists; advertising; lounge access; and baggage services (together excluding "the transportation component", the "marketing component").

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component


is deferred based on its relative selling price and amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel.

The marketing component represents services provided to our business partners and relates primarily to the use of American’s and US Airways’ logo and tradenames along with access to customers lists of AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members. The marketing services are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale.

Upon application of the relative selling price method in the fourth quarter for American’s Citibank modification, we reduced our travel component liability and recorded Other Revenue of approximately

$31 million

. As a result of the change in the marketing component value when the relative selling price method is applied, American and US Airways now defer less revenue per mile sold.

For American’s agreements where there has not been a material modification, we continue to apply the residual method.

As of

December 31, 2013

and


, AAG had

$1.5 billion

and

$1.2 billion

, respectively and American had

$1.2 billion

and

$1.2 billion

, respectively in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits (recorded as Frequent flyer liability on the consolidated balance sheets). For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, the marketing component of mileage sales recognized at the time of sale in other revenues was approximately

$834 million

,

$725 million

and

$761 million

, respectively.

A change to certain estimates used in the calculation of incremental cost could have a material impact on the liability. A 1% increase or decrease in the percentage of travel awards redeemed on partner airlines would have a

$23 million

impact on the liability as of

December 31, 2013

. A 10% increase or decrease in the assumed price per gallon of fuel would have a

$21 million

impact on the liability as of

December 31, 2013

.

A change to the estimated fair value of the transportation component could have a significant impact on revenue. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the transportation component would have an approximately

$89 million

impact on revenue recognized in


.

The number of AAdvantage and Dividend Miles one way travel award redemptions during the year ended

December 31, 2013

, was approximately

6.1 million

and

1.8 million

respectively, representing approximately

8.2%

and

3.5%

of American and US Airways’ total mainline and regional RPMs during that period, respectively. We believe displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given our load factors and our ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory.

Pensions and retiree medical and other benefits

We recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan assets; (iii) expected health care cost trend rate and, starting in 2007 and (iv) the estimated age of pilot retirement (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:


(1)

When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of

December 31, 2013

would increase our pension and postretirement benefits obligations by approximately

$1.1 billion

and

$55 million

, respectively, and increase (decrease) estimated


pension and postretirement benefit expense by

$4 million

and

$3 million

, respectively.

(2)

The expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of

31%

longer duration corporate and U.S. government/agency bonds,

31%

U.S. value stocks,

19%

developed international stocks,

10%

emerging markets stocks and bonds and

9%

alternative (private) investments. The expected return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. We monitor our actual asset allocation and believe that our long-term asset allocation will continue to approximate our target allocation. Our historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets, calculated using a geometric compounding of monthly returns, is approximately

8.9%

as of

December 31, 2013

. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of

December 31, 2013

would increase estimated


pension expense by approximately

$50 million

.

(3)

The health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated


postretirement benefits expense by

$2 million

.

Income taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, for the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

ITEM 7(A).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

AAG's Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions

The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for accounting policies and additional information regarding derivatives.

Aircraft Fuel

The Company's operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in the Company's business. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate the Company's airline, even a relatively small increase in the price of fuel can have a material adverse aggregate effect on the Company's costs and liquidity. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years with market spot prices ranging from a low of approximately

$1.87

per gallon to a high of approximately

$3.38

per gallon during the period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2013. In order to provide a measure of control over price and supply, we trade and ship fuel and maintain fuel storage facilities to support our flight operations. US Airways Group does not hedge price risk of fuel. American has historically hedged the price risk of fuel costs through the use of hedging contracts, which consist primarily of collars (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold put option) and call spreads (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold call option). Heating oil, jet fuel and crude oil are the primary underlying commodities in the hedge portfolio. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical

10%

increase in the

December 31, 2013

and


cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected


fuel usage, such an increase would result in an increase to American's Aircraft fuel and related taxes of approximately

$1.1 billion

in


, inclusive of the impact of effective fuel hedge instruments outstanding at

December 31, 2013

, and assumes our fuel hedging program remains effective. Such an increase would have resulted in an increase to American's projected Aircraft fuel and related taxes of approximately

$718 million

in


, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at

December 31, 2012

.

As of January


, the Company had cash flow hedges covering approximately

19%

of its estimated consolidated


fuel requirements. Comparatively, as of

December 31, 2012

, the Company had hedged approximately

21%

of its estimated


fuel requirements. The Company's consumption hedged for


is capped at an average price of approximately

$2.91

per gallon of jet fuel.

One percent

of the Company's estimated


fuel requirement is hedged using call spreads with protection capped at an average price of approximately

$3.18

per gallon of jet fuel.

Eighteen percent

of the Company's estimated


fuel requirement is hedged using collars with an average floor price of approximately

$2.62

per gallon of jet fuel. The cap and floor prices exclude taxes and transportation costs.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related commodities. We assess, both at the inception of each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. In doing so, we use a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g., NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel. We also monitor the actual dollar offset of the hedges' market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be "highly effective" if the R-squared is greater than

80%

and the dollar offset correlation is within

80%

to

125%

. We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if we decide to discontinue the hedging relationship.

We have not entered into any fuel hedges since the Effective Date and our current policy is not to do so. Assuming we continue to pursue this policy, once our existing hedge contracts expire or otherwise terminate, we will be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.

Foreign Currency

We are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American currencies, particularly Venezuela and Argentina. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program related to our foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. Due to our foreign-denominated revenues exceeding our foreign-denominated expenses, a uniform 10% relative strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from


December 31, 2013

and


levels relative to each of the currencies in which we have foreign currency exposure would result in an increase in our Total non-operating expense, net of approximately

$199 million

and

$164 million

, for the years ending

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, and does not address any exposure to foreign currency held on our balance sheet.

Interest

Our earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from cash and short-term investments, and our interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments. Our largest exposure with respect to variable rate debt comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). We had variable rate debt instruments representing approximately

26%

and

19%

of our total long-term debt at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. If our interest rates average

10%

more in


than they did at

December 31, 2013

, our interest expense would increase by approximately

$17 million

and interest income from cash and short-term investments would increase by approximately

$2 million

. In comparison, at

December 31, 2012

, we estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in


than they did at

December 31, 2012

, our interest expense would have increased by approximately

$7 million

and interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased by approximately

$2 million

.

Additional information regarding our debt obligations as of

December 31, 2013

is as follows (in millions):

In accordance with ASC 852, the Debtors recorded interest expense only to the extent (1) interest was paid during the Chapter 11 Cases or (2) it was probable that the Bankruptcy Court would allow a claim in respect of such interest. Interest expense AAG recorded on its Consolidated Statements of Operations totaled

$856 million

and

$632 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. AAG's contractual interest expense (including interest expense that is associated with obligations in liabilities subject to compromise) during the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


totaled

$928 million

and

$766 million

, respectively.

American's Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions

The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate American's exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. American does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note

. American discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if American decides to discontinue the hedging relationship.

American has not entered into any fuel hedges since the Effective Date and its current policy is not to do so. Assuming American continues to pursue this policy, once its existing hedge contracts expire or otherwise terminate, American will be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.

Foreign Currency

American is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. American's largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American currencies, particularly Venezuela and Argentina. American does not currently have a foreign currency hedge program related to its foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. Due to American's foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its foreign-denominated expenses, a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from

December 31, 2013

and


levels relative to each of the currencies in which American has foreign currency exposure would result in an increase in its non-operating expense, net of approximately

$199 million

and

$164 million

, for the years ending

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, and does not address any exposure to foreign currency held on its balance sheet.

Interest

American's earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and short-term investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments. American's largest exposure with respect to variable rate debt comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). American had variable rate debt instruments representing approximately

26%

and

21%

of its total long-term debt at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. If American's interest rates average

10%

more in


than they did at

December 31, 2013

, its interest expense would increase by approximately

$9 million

and interest income from cash and short-term investments would increase by approximately

$2 million

. In comparison, at

December 31, 2012

, American estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in


than they did at

December 31, 2012

, its interest expense would have increased by approximately

$7 million

and interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased by approximately

$2 million

.

Additional information regarding American's debt obligations as of

December 31, 2013

is as follows (in millions):



In accordance with ASC 852, the Debtors recorded interest expense only to the extent (1) interest was paid during the Chapter 11 Cases or (2) it was probable that the Bankruptcy Court would allow a claim in respect of such interest. Interest expense American recorded on its Consolidated Statements of Operations totaled

$700 million

and

$633 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. American's contractual interest expense (including interest expense that is associated with obligations in liabilities subject to compromise) during the years ended

(the Merger).


. Emergence From Chapter 11

Overview

On November 29, 2011 (the Petition Date), AMR Corporation (AMR) (renamed American Airlines Group Inc., AAG upon closing of the Merger, AAG and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company), its principal subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc. (American), and certain of the Company's other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors), filed voluntary petitions for relief (the Chapter 11 Cases) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order) approving and confirming the Debtors' fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan).

On December 9, 2013 (the Effective Date), the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement), dated as of February 13, 2013, by and among the Company, AMR Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) and US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group (the Merger), with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company following the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock, par value

$0.01

per share, of US Airways Group was converted into the right to receive

one

share of American Airlines Group common stock (AAG Common Stock), par value

$0.01

per share.

From the Petition Date through the Effective Date, pursuant to automatic stay provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and orders granted by the Bankruptcy Court, all actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors generally were stayed. Following the Effective Date, actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date generally have been permanently enjoined. Any unresolved claims will continue to be subject to the claims reconciliation process under the supervision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. However, certain pending litigation related to pre-petition liabilities may proceed in courts other than the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to the extent the parties to such litigation have obtained relief from the permanent injunction.



Plan of Reorganization

The Plan implements the Merger and incorporates a compromise and settlement of certain intercreditor and intercompany claim issues.

Pursuant to the Plan, all shares of AMR Corporation common stock outstanding prior to the Effective Date were canceled. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which was approved in connection with the Plan, authorizes the issuance of

1.75 billion

new shares of AAG Common Stock, par value

$0.01

per share, and

200 million

shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock, par value

$0.01

per share. Of the authorized AAG Series A Preferred Stock, approximately

168 million

were designated "Series A Convertible Preferred Stock", with a stated value

$25.00

per share, and issued in accordance with the Plan. AAG Common Stock and AAG Series A Preferred Stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols "AAL" and "AALCP", respectively, and began trading on December 9, 2013. In addition, pursuant to the Plan and the Merger agreement, up to

40 million

shares of AAG common stock was authorized for issuance under the 2013 Incentive Award Plan (the 2013 IAP).

The Plan contains the following provisions relating to the treatment of pre-petition claims against the Debtors and other holders of allowed interests in AMR Corporation:

•

all secured claims against the Debtors have been reinstated;

•

allowed administrative claims, priority claims and convenience claims have been or will be paid in full in cash;

•

other holders of allowed pre-petition unsecured claims, holders of allowed interests and certain employees of AMR received or will receive

72%

of AAG Common Stock (on a fully converted basis) authorized to be issued pursuant to the Plan and in connection with the Merger under the following provisions:

◦

all creditors holding general unsecured claims against American that are guaranteed by AAG and general unsecured claims against AAG that are guaranteed by American (Double-Dip Unsecured Claims) were treated the same under the Plan. Holders of Double-Dip Unsecured Claims received, at the Effective Date, their recovery in shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock with a stated amount equal to the allowed amount of their claims, including post-petition interest at the non-default rate;

◦

all creditors holding Single-Dip Unsecured Claims were treated the same regardless of whether the claim was asserted against the AAG Debtors, the American Debtors, or other Debtors. As used herein, "Single-Dip Unsecured Claims" means the general unsecured claims against the Debtors that are not guaranteed by any other Debtor, other than the claims of the Debtors' labor unions representing mainline workers. Holders of Single-Dip Unsecured Claims received, at the Effective Date, a portion of their recovery in shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and a right, subject to the trading price of the Company's common stock during the 120 day period after the Effective Date, to receive their remaining recovery in shares of AAG Common Stock 120 days after the Effective Date;

◦

holders of certain labor-related deemed claims and certain non-management, non-union employees as specified in the Plan received, at the Effective Date, the right to receive an allocation of shares of AAG Common Stock representing

23.6%

of the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock ultimately distributed to holders of pre-petition general unsecured creditors against the Debtors. On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, an initial allocation of approximately

39 million

shares of AAG Common Stock was made related to these labor and employee groups, of which approximately

27 million

shares were distributed on the Effective Date and approximately

13 million

shares of which were withheld in connection with the Company making a cash payment of approximately

$300 million

for certain required withholding taxes;

◦

holders of allowed interests in AMR (primarily holders of AMR common stock existing immediately prior to the Effective Date) received, at the Effective Date, a distribution of approximately

26 million

shares of AAG Common Stock representing

3.5%

of the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock contemplated for issuance pursuant to the Plan and, will receive additional shares of AAG Common Stock if, among other considerations, the trading price of the Company's common stock at various points during the 120 day period after the Effective Date provides for a full recovery to claimholders and other allowed priority interests; and

◦

holders of disputed claims at the Effective Date, to the extent such disputed claims become allowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims after the Effective Date, are eligible to receive shares of AAG Common Stock held in reserve (Disputed Claims Reserve), beginning after 120 days after the Effective Date. Disputed claimholders that subsequently become Single-Dip Unsecured Claimholders will receive, subject to the availability of sufficient shares in the Disputed Claims Reserve, the number of shares of AAG Common Stock that the Disputed claimholder would have received had such claimholder been a Single-Dip Unsecured Claimholder as of the Effective Date.

The Plan contemplates the distribution of up to

756 million

shares of common stock of which approximately

53 million

shares were issued to the Debtors' stakeholders in connection with the Effective Date. In accordance with the Plan, the Company



will issue the remaining shares of AAG Common Stock over the 120 day distribution period and as disputed claims are resolved. In addition, pursuant to the Plan approximately

197 million

common shares were distributed to holders of outstanding shares of US Airways Group common stock.

Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan has established a disputed claim reserve to hold shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and AAG Common Stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders that ultimately become allowed Single-Dip general unsecured claimholders after emergence. The shares provided for under the Plan are determined based upon a disputed claim reserve amount of approximately

$755 million

, representing the maximum amount of additional allowable Single-Dip claims under the Plan's provisions. Approximately

16 million

shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock were reserved at the Effective Date for distribution to holders of disputed Single-Dip general unsecured claims whose claims ultimately become allowed. Additional new shares of AAG Common Stock will be distributed into the reserve on or about the 120th day after the Effective Date. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of the remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to the Company but rather will be distributed by priority first, if necessary, to satisfy unsecured claims or labor-related obligations, and then to former AMR shareholders as of the Effective Date.

We are not required to distribute additional shares above the

756 million

shares contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay all allowed unsecured claims. However, resolution of disputed claims could have a material effect on Single-Dip creditor recoveries under the Plan and the amount of additional share distributions, if any, that are made to former AMR shareholders as the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock that remain available for distribution upon resolution of disputed claims is limited pursuant to the Plan.

In addition, as of

December 31, 2013

, the Company made the following cash disbursements under the Plan:

•

$385 million

in cash to the Pension plans in connection with missed contributions to the pension plans during Chapter 11 and interest and penalty interest thereon;

•

$105 million

to holders in partial or full satisfaction of their claims, including to holders of administrative claims, and state and local priority tax claims;

•

$196 million

in cure payments to holders of secured debt; and

•

Approximately

$300 million

for payroll taxes associated with equity distributions to employees.

Several parties have filed appeals seeking reconsideration of the Confirmation Order. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

As noted above, the reconciliation process with respect to the remaining claims will take considerable time post-emergence. Included in mandatorily convertible preferred stock and other bankruptcy settlement obligations on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2013

, are the Company's estimates of the amounts of disputed claims that will ultimately become allowed Single-Dip general unsecured claims. As these claims are resolved, or where better information becomes available and is evaluated, we will make adjustments to the liabilities recorded on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as appropriate. Any such adjustments could be material to the Company's financial position or results of operations in any given period.

Availability and Utilization of Net Operating Losses

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Debtors experienced an "ownership change" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code which could potentially limit the ability to utilize certain tax attributes including the Debtors’ substantial NOLs. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. While the Debtors anticipate taking advantage of certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that would permit approximately

$9.0 billion

of the federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382, there can be no assurance that these special rules will apply.

Moreover, an ownership change subsequent to the Debtors’ emergence from bankruptcy may further limit or effectively eliminate the ability to utilize the Debtors’ NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the Debtors’ ability to utilize the NOL Carryforwards, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial shareholders. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, there can be no assurance that an ownership change will not occur even with these transfer restrictions. A copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation was attached as Exhibit 3.1 to a Form 8-K filed on December 9, 2013, by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.



Liabilities Subject to Compromise

Liabilities subject to compromise refers to pre-petition obligations which may be impacted by the Chapter 11 reorganization process. These amounts represent the Debtors' current estimate of known or potential pre-petition obligations to be resolved in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.

Pursuant to the Plan, allowed pre-petition claims and estimated unresolved pre-petition claims of

$5.1 billion

were settled in cash, AAG Series A Preferred Stock and other bankruptcy settlement obligations on the Effective Date. The pension and postretirement benefits obligation included below was reinstated and is included in Pension and postretirement benefits in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly, there are no Liabilities Subject to Compromise at

December 31, 2013

.

The following table summarizes the components of liabilities subject to compromise included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2012

(in millions):

Long-term debt, including undersecured debt, classified as subject to compromise as of

December 31, 2012

consisted of (in millions):

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred in the Chapter 11 Cases. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


(in millions):

(1)

Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing or facility agreements when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim.



(2)

Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended

December 31, 2013

, the Company recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of

$180 million

, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.

(3)

The Plan allows unsecured creditors receiving AAG Series A Preferred Stock a conversion discount of

3.5%

. Accordingly, the Company recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court.


. Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and Other Bankruptcy Settlement Obligations

As of

December 31, 2013

, the components of Mandatorily convertible preferred stock and other bankruptcy settlement obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows (in millions):

The AAG Series A Preferred Stock, while outstanding, votes and participates in accordance with the terms of the underlying Certificate of Designation. One quarter of the shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock initially issued is mandatorily convertible on each of the 30

th

, 60

th

, 90

th

and 120

th

days after the Effective Date. In addition, subject to certain limitations, holders of AAG Series A Preferred Stock may elect to convert up to an additional

10 million

shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock during each 30-day period following the Effective Date thereby reducing the number of shares to be converted on the 120

th

day after the Effective Date. The initial stated value of each share of AAG Series A Preferred Stock is

$25.00

and accrues dividends at

6.25%

per annum, calculated daily, while outstanding. Additionally, AAG Series A Preferred Stock converts to AAG Common Stock based upon the volume weighted average price of the shares of AAG Common Stock on the five trading days immediately preceding the conversion date, at a

3.5%

fixed discount, subject to a conversion price floor of

$10.875

per share and a conversion price cap of

$33.8080

per share, below or above which the conversion rate remains fixed. AAG Series A Preferred Stock embodies an unconditional obligation to transfer a variable number of shares based predominately on a fixed monetary amount known at inception, and, as such, it is not treated as equity, but rather as a liability until such time that it is converted to AAG Common Stock. Accordingly, AAG Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at

December 31, 2013

is included within the "Mandatorily convertible preferred stock and other bankruptcy settlement obligations" line on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon conversion of any remaining AAG Series A Preferred Stock on the 120

th

day after the Effective Date, all AAG Series A Preferred Stock will have been converted to AAG Common Stock and no AAG Series A Preferred Stock will then remain outstanding. As of February 19, 2014, approximately

107 million

shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into an aggregate of

95 million

shares of AAG Common Stock.

The Company's Single-Dip equity obligations, while outstanding, do not vote or participate in accordance with the terms of the Plan. These equity contract obligations, representing the amount of total Single-Dip unsecured creditor obligations not satisfied through the issuance of AAG Series A Preferred Stock at the Effective Date, represent an unconditional obligation to transfer a variable number of shares based predominantly on a fixed monetary amount known at inception, and, as such, are not treated as equity, but rather as liabilities until the 120

th

day after emergence. At the 120

th

day after emergence, the Company will issue a variable amount of AAG Common Stock necessary to satisfy the obligation amount at emergence, plus accrued dividends of

12%

per annum, calculated daily, through the 120

th

day after emergence, based on the volume weighted average price of the shares of AAG Common Stock at a

3.5%

discount, as specified in the Plan and, subject to there being a sufficient number of shares remaining for issuance to unsecured creditors under the Plan.

In exchange for employees' contributions to the successful reorganization of the Company, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, the Company agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a fixed percentage of the distributions to be made to general unsecured claimholders. The fair value based on the expected number of shares to be distributed to satisfy this deemed claim was approximately

$1.7 billion

. On the Effective Date, the Company made an initial distribution of

$595 million

in common stock and American paid approximately

$300 million

in cash to cover payroll taxes related to the equity distribution. As of

December 31, 2013

, the remaining liability to certain AMR labor groups and employees of

$849 million

is based upon the estimated fair value of the shares expected to be issued in satisfaction of such obligation, measured as if the obligation were settled using the trading price of AAG Common Stock at

December 31, 2013

. Increases in the trading price of AAG Common Stock after

December 31, 2013

,



could cause a decrease in the fair value measurement of the remaining obligation, and vice-versa. The Company will record this obligation at fair value primarily through the 120

th

day after emergence, at which time the obligation will be materially settled.


. Merger and Related Matters

Description of Transaction

As previously discussed in Note


, on the Effective Date, the Debtors consummated their reorganization and the Merger pursuant to the Plan. The Merger has been accounted for as a business acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations," with AAG considered the acquirer of US Airways Group. The acquisition method of accounting requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The acquisition values have also been reflected in US Airways Group's separate-entity financial statements as of December 9, 2013. The excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of assets and liabilities acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill will not be amortized, but will be tested for impairment at least annually.

Slot Divestiture

As a stipulation for the Merger to be approved by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Company was required to divest certain slots and LaGuardia Airport and Washington Regan National Airport. As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company recognized a gain of

$67 million

related to the sale the LaGuardia Airport slots, which has been included in

Special items, net in the consolidated statement of operations

. The relevant Washington Regan National Airport slots were classified as assets held for sale and included in Prepaid expenses and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Tax Matters

The Company experienced an "ownership change" in connection with its emergence from bankruptcy which under Section 382 could substantially constrain the use of a company’s NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. However, the general limitation rules of Section 382 are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. While the Company anticipates taking advantage of these special rules that would permit the utilization of substantially all of the company’s NOL carryforwards, there can be no assurance that those special rules will apply. If the special rules do not apply, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards may be subject to limitation. See Note


for additional information related to tax matters.

Fair Value of Consideration Transferred

The fair value of the consideration transferred, or the purchase price, was derived as described below based on the outstanding shares of US Airways Group common stock at December 9, 2013, the exchange ratio of one share of AAG Common Stock for each share of US Airways Group common stock, and a price per share of AAG Common Stock of

$22.55

, which represented the closing price of US Airways Group common stock on December 6, 2013, the last day such shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. US Airways Group equity awards outstanding at the close of the Merger converted into equity awards with respect to AAG Common Stock. Vested equity awards held by employees of US Airways Group are considered part of the purchase price.

(in millions except per share data)

Allocation of Consideration Transferred

The Merger has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations," with AAG treated as the acquirer of US Airways Group for accounting purposes. The acquisition method of



accounting requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually.

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income and cost approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, other than certain long-term debt assumed in the Merger. The market approach, which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets, was utilized to estimate the fair value of US Airways’ aircraft and operating leases. The market approach included prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets, as well as pricing guides and other sources. The Company considered the current market for the aircraft, the maintenance condition of the aircraft and the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets, among other factors. The Company also utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take-off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available. The income approach was primarily used to value intangible assets, including customer relationships, marketing agreements, certain international route authorities, and the US Airways logo and tradenames. The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for certain assets for which the market and income approaches could not be applied due to the nature of the asset. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. The fair value of US Airways’ Dividend Miles frequent flyer program liability was determined based on the equivalent ticket value of outstanding miles which were expected to be redeemed at December 9, 2013. The equivalent ticket value contemplates purchased tickets that have similar restrictions as frequent traveler awards. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company may periodically adjust the value of goodwill to reflect changes that occur as a result of adjustments during the measurement period following the date of acquisition.

Pro-forma Impact of the Merger

The AAG unaudited pro-forma results presented below include the effects of the US Airways acquisition as if it had been consummated as of January 1, 2012. The pro-forma results include the depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired tangible and intangible assets, lease fair value adjustments, elimination of any deferred gains or losses from other comprehensive income and the impact of income changes on profit sharing expense, among others. However, pro-forma results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisition. Accordingly, the unaudited pro-forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated as of January 1, 2012.



Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified between various financial statement line items to conform to the new AAG financial statement presentation. These reclassifications do not impact the historic net income and are comprised principally of the following items:

•

Reclassifications between various operating income line items to conform the presentation of Cargo and Other revenues.

•

Reclassifications between various operating expense line items to conform the presentation of regional airline expenses.

•

Reclassifications between other nonoperating income (expense), net and operating expenses to conform the presentation of foreign currency gains and losses.

The following table summarizes the historical and revised financial statement amounts for AAG (in millions).

Additionally, the Company reclassified approximately

$292 million

from current to noncurrent liabilities as of December 31, 2012.


. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a result of the Merger, the Consolidated Financial Statements presented include the results of AMR and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, American and AMR Eagle, for periods ended prior to



December 9, 2013 and consolidated results of AAG, which includes American, AMR Eagle and US Airways Group, for periods ending on or after December 9, 2013. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the accounts of US Airways Group for the 23 days ended December 31, 2013. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Chapter 11 Matters

In accordance with GAAP, the Debtors applied ASC 852 "Reorganizations" (ASC 852), in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASC 852 requires that the financial statements, for periods subsequent to the Chapter 11 Cases, distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred in the Chapter 11 Cases are recorded in Reorganization Items, Net on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, pre-petition obligations that may be impacted by the Chapter 11 reorganization process as of December 31, 2012 were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Liabilities Subject to Compromise.

Certain of AMR's non-U.S. subsidiaries were not part of the Chapter 11 Cases. Since these non-US subsidiaries do not have significant transactions, AAG does not separately disclose the combined financial statements of such non-U.S. subsidiaries in accordance with the requirements of reorganization accounting.

In accordance with ASC 852, AAG did not meet the criteria for and will not adopt "fresh start" accounting as the reorganization value of AMR's assets, as determined based upon an estimate of the fair value of AMR's equity using the trading market price of US Airways Group and the amount of post-petition liabilities as of the Effective Date was greater than total pre-petition liabilities and expected allowed claims.

As a result, AAG's assets and liabilities were not adjusted to fair value.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted revised guidance on the

Comprehensive Income

topic of the FASB Codification which requires an entity to present, either parenthetically on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted revised guidance on

Balance Sheet

topic of the FASB Codification, which clarifies the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The clarification applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and to certain securities borrowing and securities lending transactions, and not to ordinary trade receivables and payables. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments

The Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers' compensation obligations, credit card processing holdback requirements.

Aircraft fuel, spare parts, and supplies, net

Aircraft fuel, spare parts, and supplies, are recorded at net realizable value based on average costs. These items are expensed when used. An allowance for obsolescence is provided for aircraft spare parts and supplies.



Maintenance, Materials and Repairs

Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms when an obligation exists.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by AAG on December 9, 2013, in connection with the Merger. Goodwill will not be amortized but tested for impairment annually.

Other Intangibles, net

Intangible assets consist primarily of airport take-off and landing rights (Slots), customer relationships, market partners, international route authorities, and tradenames. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

In connection with the application of acquisition accounting as of December 9, 2013, the intangible assets acquired from US Airways were measured at fair value using the market and income approaches. The Company utilized the market approach to value airport Slots, when sufficient market information was available, and included prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets as well as pricing guides and other sources. The Company utilized the income approach to value the customer relationships and marketing agreements, certain international route authorities and the US Airways tradenames. The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money.

The following table provides information relating to the Company's amortized intangible assets as of

December 31, 2013

and


(in millions):

Airport operating and gate lease rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over


years to a

zero

residual value. The customer relationships, marketing agreements and tradenames were identified as intangible assets subject to amortization and will be amortized over approximately

nine years

,

30 years

and

15 months

, respectively.

The Company recorded amortization expense related to these intangible assets of approximately

$20 million

,

$25 million

, and

$27 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, respectively. The Company expects to record annual amortization expense for the aforementioned definite-life intangible assets as follows (in millions):

The Company's indefinite-lived assets include certain international route authorities and domestic airport take-off and landing slots. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. As of

December 31, 2013

, and


, the Company had

$1.8 billion

and

$708 million

, respectively, of indefinite-lived intangible assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.



Operating Property and Equipment

Operating property and equipment are recorded at cost. Interest expense related to the acquisition of certain property and equipment, including aircraft purchase deposits, is capitalized as an additional cost of the asset. Interest capitalized for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


was

$47 million

,

$50 million

and

$40 million

, respectively. Property and equipment is depreciated and amortized to residual values over the estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is less, using the straight-line method. Costs of major improvements that enhance the usefulness of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset or the modifications, whichever is less. The depreciable lives used for the principal depreciable asset classifications are:

Residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are generally

5%

to

10%

, except when guaranteed by a third-party for a different amount.

Equipment and property under capital leases are amortized over the term of the leases or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their expected useful lives. Lease terms vary but are generally


to


years for aircraft and

three

to


years for other leased equipment and property.

The Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset and the net book value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Passenger Revenue

Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors, including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized, including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company's historical experience, and are recorded at the scheduled time of departure.

The Company purchases capacity, or ASMs, generated by the Company's wholly-owned regional air carriers and the capacity of Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation (Air Wisconsin), Republic Airways Holdings' subsidiaries Republic Airlines (Republic) and Chautauqua Airlines (Chautauqua), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (Mesa), and SkyWest Airlines, Inc.'s subsidiaries Sky West Airlines (SkyWest) and ExpressJet Airlines (ExpressJet) in certain markets. The Company's wholly-owned regional air carriers and Air Wisconsin, Chautauqua, ExpressJet, Republic, Mesa, and SkyWest operate regional aircraft in these markets as part of either American Eagle carriers or US Airways Express. The Company classifies revenues generated from transportation on these carriers as regional passenger revenues. Liabilities related to tickets sold by the Company for travel on these air carriers are also included in the Company's air traffic liability and are subsequently relieved in the same manner as described above.

Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by the Company as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.



Frequent Flyer Programs

The Company currently operates two frequent traveler programs, American's AAdvantage and US Airways' Dividend Miles. These programs award mileage credits to passengers who fly on American and oneworld carriers and US Airways and Star Alliance carriers, respectively, as well as certain other partner airlines that participate in the programs. Effective March 31, 2014, US Airways will join the oneworld alliance and exit the Star Alliance. At that point, frequent travel reciprocity will be discontinued for many Star Alliance airlines. Mileage credits can also be earned through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in our respective loyalty programs. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American, US Airways or other participating partner airlines, in which case the Company pays a fee.

The Company uses the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members earn mileage credits by flying on American, US Airways or its regional affiliates. The Company has an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore has recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.

The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level required to redeem an award. Additionally, outstanding mileage credits are subject to expiration if unused. In calculating the liability, the Company estimates how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and excludes those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These estimates are based on historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the statement of operations as a part of passenger revenue.

The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. Incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food, and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. In addition, the Company also includes in the determination of incremental cost the amount of certain fees related to redemptions expected to be collected from AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members. These redemption fees reduce incremental cost. No profit or overhead margin is included in the accrual of incremental cost. These estimates are generally updated based upon our 12-month historical average of such costs.

The Company applied the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Merger and therefore recorded the liability for outstanding US Airways mileage credits at fair value. As of

December 31, 2013

, the liability for outstanding mileage credits expected to be redeemed for future travel awards for US Airways under the Dividend Miles program was

$932 million

and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within Frequent flyer liability. This liability will be reduced as miles are redeemed and new miles earned will be recorded as a liability based on the incremental cost method discussed above.

As of

December 31, 2013

the liability for outstanding mileage credits for the AAdvantage program was

$580 million

and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within Frequent flyer liability.

American and US Airways also sell frequent flyer program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to business partners is comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. Historically, American and US Airways have used the residual method of accounting to determine the values of each component as there had not been a material modification to any significant agreements since our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" on January 1, 2011.

During the fourth quarter, American and Citibank amended their current AAdvantage co-branded credit card agreement which resulted in a material modification of the terms of the arrangement. Also, in connection with the acquisition of US Airways on December 9, 2013, a material modification occurred on all of US Airways' agreements in connection with the merger. Therefore, subsequent to the amendments of these arrangements, AAG will apply the relative selling price method to determine the values of each deliverable. Under the relative selling price approach, American and US Airways identified five revenue elements for the co-branded credit card agreement with Citibank and Dividend Miles co-branded credit card agreement with Barclays: the transportation component; use of the American and US Airways’ brand including access to frequent flyer member lists; advertising; lounge access; and baggage services (together excluding "the transportation component", the "marketing component").

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component



is deferred based on its relative selling price and amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel.

The marketing component represents services provided to the Company's business partners and relates primarily to the use of American’s and US Airways’ logo and tradenames along with access to customers lists of AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members. The marketing services are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale.

Upon application of the relative selling price method in the fourth quarter for American’s Citibank modification, American reduced its travel component liability and recorded Other Revenue of approximately

$31 million

. As a result of the change in the marketing component value when the relative selling price method is applied, American and US Airways now defer less revenue per mile sold.

For American’s agreements where there has not been a material modification, it continues to apply the residual method.

As of

December 31, 2013

and


, the Company had

$1.5 billion

and

$1.2 billion

, respectively in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits (recorded as Frequent flyer liability on the consolidated balance sheets). For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, the marketing component of mileage sales recognized at the time of sale in other revenues was approximately

$834 million

,

$725 million

and

$761 million

, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, for the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

Selling Expenses

Selling expenses include commissions, credit card fees, computerized reservations systems fees and advertising. Advertising expenses are expensed on a straight-line basis as incurred throughout the year. Advertising expense was

$166 million

,

$153 million

and

$186 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, respectively.

Deferred Gains and Credits, net

Included within deferred gains and credits, net are amounts deferred and amortized into future periods associated with the adjustment of leases to fair value in connection with the application of acquisition accounting and certain vendor incentives.

Share-based Compensation

The Company accounts for its share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of grant, which is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock award. The fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market price of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant. See Note


for further discussion of share-based compensation.

Foreign Currency Gains and Losses

Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded as part of other nonoperating expense, net in AAG's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency losses for


,


and


were

$56 million

,

$41 million

and

$17 million

, respectively.

Subsequent Events

In connection with preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and in accordance U.S. GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of

December 31, 2013

and identified items as set forth in Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements.




. Special Items, Net

The following table summarizes the components of the Company's Special items, net, as of

December 31, 2013

, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):

(1)

Consists primarily of impairment charges to write-down certain Boeing 757 aircraft and certain related long-lived assets to their estimated fair value in connection with reclassification of these assets to held for sale.

(2)

Consists primarily of a

$107 million

fair value adjustment to the pilot long-term disability plan and a

$43 million

charge to benefits expense due to a reorganization related increase in workers' compensation claims in the applicable period including adverse developments on older claims. Charges in 2012 are in connection with voluntary and involuntary employee separations from the Company and were paid through the end of 2013.

(3)

Employee related expenses primarily consist of a

$192 million

charge resulting from the US Airways Group pilot MOU that became effective upon consummation of the Merger,

$58 million

in severance to satisfy certain separation agreements resulting from the Merger and professional fees and

$56 million

related to equity awards granted in connection with the Merger, partially offset by the cancellation of equity awards in connection with the Merger.

(4)

Recognition of a

$67 million

gain on the sale of slots at LaGuardia and Ronald Regan Washington National Airport as part of the settlement reached with the Department of Justice.


. Investments and Fair Value Measurements

Short-term investments consisted of (in millions):

Short-term investments at

December 31, 2013

, by contractual maturity included (in millions):



All short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Company's short-term investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities. The Company's fuel derivative contracts, which consist primarily of call options, collars (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold put option) and call spreads (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold call option), are valued using energy and commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs with quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves and volatilities. Heating oil, jet fuel and crude oil are the primary underlying commodities in the hedge portfolio. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

(1)

Unrealized gains or losses on short-term investments, restricted cash and short-term investments and derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at each measurement date.

(2)

The Company's short-term investments mature in one year or less except for

$250 million

of Bank notes/Certificates of deposit/Time deposits,

$511 million

of U.S. Government agency investments and

$2.1 billion

of Corporate obligations.

A

$56 million

Level 1 restricted money market security was liquidated in August 2013. The cash proceeds were subsequently reinvested in a Level 2 U.S. Treasury Obligation. The Company's policy regarding the recording of transfers between levels is to reflect any such transfers at the end of the reporting period.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company had no exposure to European sovereign debt.




. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

Aircraft Acquisition Commitments

in


,


and


, respectively.



Sale-leaseback Arrangements

During


, American financed


Boeing 737-800 and

three

777-300ER aircraft under sale-leaseback arrangements, which are accounted for as operating leases. Gains and losses associated with these sale-leaseback transactions are amortized over the respective remaining lease term and are included in the consolidated balance sheets as deferred gains and prepaid rent, respectively.

American has entered into sale-leaseback arrangements with certain leasing companies to finance


Boeing 737-800 scheduled to be delivered beginning in January 2014. The financings of each aircraft under these arrangements are subject to certain terms and conditions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Aircraft

AAG has


owned aircraft and


leased aircraft which were financed with pass through trust certificates, or EETCs, issued by pass through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allowed AAG to raise the financing for several aircraft at one time and place such funds in escrow pending the purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to AAG.

Each trust covered a set amount of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced within a specific period of time. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the funds in escrow to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes were issued, at AAG's election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leased the aircraft to American or US Airways, as applicable. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG, American or US Airways. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American or US Airways and in certain instances are guaranteed by AAG or US Airways Group, as applicable. As of

December 31, 2013

,

$6.0 billion

associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

With respect to leveraged leases, AAG evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity and concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. AAG generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates AAG to absorb decreases in value or entitles AAG to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. AAG does not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Each lease does have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows AAG to purchase the aircraft near the end of the lease term. However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircraft's fair value at the option date. Under this feature, AAG does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. AAG concluded it was not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, AAG accounts for its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. AAG's total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are

$2.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2013

, which are included in the future minimum lease payments table above.

Special Facility Revenue Bonds

AAG guarantees the payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment which is leased to AAG. Under such leases, AAG is required to make rental payments through


, sufficient to pay maturing principal and interest payments on the related bonds. To the extent these transactions were committed to prior to May 21, 1998, they are accounted for as operating leases. Approximately

$498 million

of the special facility revenue bonds, with total future payments of approximately

$715 million

as of

December 31, 2013

, are guaranteed by AAG, American, US Airways Group or US Airways. Approximately

$112 million

of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the bonds in 2014. Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling accruals or are considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments.



Legal Proceedings

Chapter 11 Cases

. As previously disclosed, on the Petition Date, November 29, 2011, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order approving and confirming the Debtors' Plan. On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group, with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG. From the Petition Date through the Effective Date, pursuant to automatic stay provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and orders granted by the Bankruptcy Court, all actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors generally were stayed. Following the Effective Date, actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date, generally have been permanently enjoined. Any unresolved claims will continue to be subject to the claims reconciliation process under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court. However, certain pending litigation related to pre-petition liabilities may proceed in courts other than the Bankruptcy Court to the extent the parties to such litigation have obtained relief from the permanent injunction.

Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan has established a disputed claim reserve to hold shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and AAG Common Stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders that ultimately become allowed Single-Dip general unsecured claimholders after emergence. The shares provided for under the Plan are determined based upon a disputed claim reserve amount of approximately

$755 million

. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of the remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to AAG but rather will be distributed by priority first, if necessary, to satisfy unsecured claims or labor-related obligations, and then to former AMR shareholders as of the Effective Date. AAG is not required to distribute additional shares above the

756 million

shares contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay all allowed unsecured claims. However, resolution of disputed claims could have a material effect on Single-Dip creditor recoveries under the Plan and the amount of additional share distributions, if any, that are made to former AMR shareholders as the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock that remain available for distribution upon resolution of disputed claims is limited pursuant to the Plan.

There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a determination that certain non-pension, post-employee benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be terminated without liability to American. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet ruled on this matter and we cannot predict whether American will receive relief from any of these obligations.

Government Antitrust Actions

. On August 13, 2013, the U.S. government, along with the States of Arizona, Florida, Tennessee and Texas, the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia (collectively, the plaintiff states), filed a complaint against US Airways Group and AMR in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the proposed Merger would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and sought to permanently enjoin the transaction. On September 5, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding the State of Michigan as a plaintiff. On October 1, 2013, the State of Texas entered into an agreement with US Airways Group and AMR that resolved that state’s objections to the Merger, and its claims were dismissed with prejudice on October 7, 2013. On November 11, 2013, US Airways and American entered into agreements with the U.S. government and the plaintiff states resolving all claims in the litigation. The agreement with the U.S. government requires the carriers to divest assets at certain airports and remains subject to public comment and court approval. In the agreement with the United States government, among other things, we agreed to divest and not reacquire for

ten

years certain rights and assets consisting of


Slot pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport, and


Slot pairs at LaGuardia, in each case together with and associated gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those Slot pairs, and

two

gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport. The agreement with the plaintiff states, which was entered by the court on November 12, 2013, requires our airlines, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, to maintain certain hub operations in a manner generally consistent with historical operations and to continue to provide scheduled daily service to certain specified communities, both for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from Washington Reagan National Airport

Merger Class Action

. On March 1, 2013, a complaint captioned Plumbers & Steamfitters Local Union No. 248 Pension Fund v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., No. CV2013-051605, was filed as a putative class action on behalf of the stockholders of US Airways Group in the Superior Court for Maricopa County, Arizona. On July 3, 2013, an amended complaint, captioned Dennis Palkon, et al. v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., No. CV2013-051605, was filed with the same court. The amended complaint names as defendants US Airways Group and the members of its board of directors, and alleges that the directors failed



to maximize the value of US Airways Group in connection with the Merger and that US Airways Group aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duty. The relief sought in the amended complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or rescission in the event it has been consummated. The court in the above-referenced action denied the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order that had sought to enjoin the US Airways Group Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The above-referenced action was stayed pending the outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. government and various states on August 13, 2013 (described above). This stay has now been lifted and a motion to dismiss this action filed by US Airways Group is pending before the court. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.

Private Party Antitrust Action

. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint names as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, and alleges that the effect of the Merger may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. The relief sought in the complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants, and on October 2, 2013, dismissed the initial California action. The Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On January 10, 2014, the Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add a claim for money damages and to request injunctive relief requiring the carriers to hold separate their assets. Trial is set for June 2014. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.

US Airways Sabre Matter

. On April 21, 2011, US Airways Inc. filed an antitrust lawsuit against Sabre Holdings Corporation, Sabre Inc. and Sabre Travel International Limited (collectively, Sabre) in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit, as amended to date, alleges, among other things, that Sabre has engaged in anticompetitive practices to preserve its market power by restricting our ability to distribute our products to our customers. The lawsuit also alleges that these actions have permitted Sabre to charge supracompetitive booking fees and to use technologies that are not as robust and as efficient as alternatives in a competitive market. The lawsuit seeks both injunctive relief and money damages. Sabre filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the court denied in part and granted in part in September 2011 allowing two of the four counts in the complaint to proceed. We intend to pursue our claims against Sabre vigorously, but there can be no assurance of the outcome of this litigation.

General

. The Company and its subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within the control of the Company. Therefore, although the Company will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on the Company are uncertain.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

US Airways assigned to Delta a lease agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey related to the East End Terminal at LaGuardia airport. A portion of the rental payments under the lease are used to repay special revenue bonds issued by the Port Authority. The revenue bonds have a final scheduled maturity in 2015 and had an outstanding principal amount of approximately

$43 million

at

December 31, 2013

. Pursuant to the terms of the lease assignment, US Airways is contingently liable for Delta's obligations, as assignee, under the lease agreement in the event Delta fails to perform such obligations including, without limitation, the payment of all rentals and other amounts due under the lease agreement. US Airways has the right to cure any failure by Delta to perform its obligations under the lease agreement and, in addition, US Airways has the right to reoccupy the terminal if it so chooses to cure any such default.

The Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. The Company is not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs.

In its aircraft financing agreements, the Company generally indemnifies the financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other relevant parties against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the negligence of the indemnified parties.

The Company's loan agreements and other London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate the Company to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii) any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy requirements. In addition, the Company's loan agreements, derivative contracts and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to the applicable



lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law.

These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts the Company could be obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle the lender to foreclose on the collateral to realize the amount due.

In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans and derivative transactions, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, the Company may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant transaction.

The Company has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real estate leases where the Company as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities related to the Company's use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, the Company provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to the Company's use of the leased property.

Under certain contracts with third parties, the Company indemnifies the third-party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third-party, or certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. The Company has liability insurance protecting the Company for some of the obligations it has undertaken under these indemnities.

The Company is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its operations. The Company is also subject to regulatory assessments in the ordinary course of business. The Company establishes reserves for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from these regulatory matters, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, after consideration of available insurance.

Venezuela Cash and Short-term Investments

The business environment in Venezuela has been challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluation, high inflation and governmental restrictions, including currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

$710 million

of our unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars, valued at a weighted average rate of

6.04

bolivars to the dollar. The period of time to exchange those funds into dollars and repatriate them has been increasing and is presently more than a year. On January 23, 2014, the Venezuelan government issued a regulation to implement a new system for determining the exchange rate based on the result of limited periodic sales of dollars known as Sicad auctions (currently

11.80

to the dollar based on the February 21, 2014 Sicad auction) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of conversion and repatriation of local currency. The government also enacted a new law effective February 19, 2014 that authorizes additional methods of exchanging Venezuelan bolivars at rates other than the controlled base rate of 6.3 to the dollar or the existing Sicad auction rate, but the regulations necessary to implement the law are still pending and it is not clear at this point whether or how the new methods may impact the pending balances of Venezuelan bolivars held by airlines. We are working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. Further, the current, devalued rates may have an ongoing adverse effect on our reported results if we are unable to fully adjust prices on flights to and from Venezuela, of which there can be no assurance. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors "

We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control"

for additional discussion on currency risks.



Other

In 2010, American and Japan Airlines entered into a JBA under which, amongst other things, American provided Japan Airlines a guarantee of certain minimum incremental revenue resulting from the successful operation of the joint business for the first three years following its implementation, subject to certain terms and conditions. As of

December 31, 2013

, American reached an agreement with JAL to settle the liability at an amount already recorded.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company entered into a settlement agreement resolving a commercial dispute. The settlement agreement includes two elements which were valued at relative fair value and will be recognized when earned. The Company determined that the settlement includes a litigation gain of

$280 million

, which was valued using future cash flows and recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012. The settlement also includes an incentive which is contingent upon signing a future contract and will be recognized over the term of the future contract. The contract was signed in January, 2014.

As a result of the Terrorist Attacks and the subsequent liability protections provided for by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act), the Company recorded a liability for the Terrorist Attacks claims equal to the related insurance receivable due to American. The Stabilization Act provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims, whether compensatory or punitive, arising from the Terrorist Attacks, against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability coverage maintained by the air carrier. As of

December 31, 2013

, the remaining liability and the amount of the offsetting receivable were each

$1.0 billion

.

Indebtedness

Secured financings are collateralized by assets, primarily aircraft, engines, simulators, rotable aircraft parts, hangar and maintenance facilities, route authorities and airport Slots. At

December 31, 2013

, the maturities of long-term debt and capital leases are as follows (in millions):

At

December 31, 2013

, the Company was operating


jet aircraft under capital leases. Leases can generally be renewed at rates based on fair market value at the end of the lease term for a number of additional years.

As of

December 31, 2013

, AAG had issued guarantees covering approximately

$1.3 billion

of American's tax-exempt bond debt (and interest thereon) and

$4.7 billion

of American's secured debt (and interest thereon).

In connection with the Merger and pursuant to the Plan on December 9, 2013, (i) the Company and American entered into a joinder to loan agreement and became co-obligors of US Airways Group's

$1.6 billion

2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, (ii) the Company and American entered into a second supplemental indenture that guarantee the payment obligations associated with the US Airways Group's

6.125%

Notes, due in

Convertible Notes, due in


(the 7.25% notes).

2013-1 EETCs (American)

On March 12, 2013, American closed its private offering of

two

tranches of enhanced equipment trust certificates (the Series 2013-1A/B EETCs) in the aggregate face amount of

$664 million

. The Series 2013-1A/B EETCs are comprised of a senior tranche of Class A Certificates with an interest rate of

4.00%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of July 15, 2025, and a junior tranche of Class B Certificates with an interest rate of

5.625%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of January 15, 2021. The Series 2013-1A/B EETCs represent an interest in the assets of

two

separate pass through trusts, each of which hold equipment notes issued by American. Interest on the issued and outstanding equipment notes will be payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2013, and principal on such equipment notes is scheduled for payment on January 15 and July 15 of certain years, commencing on January 15, 2014. As of

December 31, 2013

, the equipment notes are secured by

eight

currently owned Boeing 737-823 aircraft,

one

currently owned Boeing 777-223ER aircraft, and

four

currently owned Boeing 777-323ER aircraft. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act).

On June 5, 2013, American closed its private offering of Class C enhanced equipment trust certificates (the Series 2013-1C EETCs) in the aggregate face amount of

$120 million

. The Series 2013-1C EETCs rank junior to the Series 2013-1A/B EETCs. The Series 2013-1C EETCs were issued with an interest rate of

6.125%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of July 15, 2018. The 2013-1C EETCs represent an interest in the assets of a separate pass through trust, which will hold certain equipment notes issued by American. The Series 2013-1C EETCs are secured by the same aircraft securing the Series 2013-1A/B EETCs. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

2013-2 EETCs (American)

The Company filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court on

October 9, 2012

requesting entry of an order authorizing American to, among other things: (i) obtain post-petition financing in an amount of up to

$1.5 billion

secured on a first priority basis by, among other things, up to


Boeing 737-823 aircraft,


Boeing 757-223 aircraft,

one

Boeing 767-323ER aircraft and


Boeing 777-223ER aircraft as part of a new enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) financing (the Refinancing EETC) to be offered pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (ii) use cash on hand (including proceeds of the Refinancing EETC) to indefeasibly repay the existing pre-petition obligations secured by such aircraft, as applicable, which are currently financed through, as the case may be, an EETC financing entered into by American in July 2009 (the Series 2009-1 Pass Through Certificates), a secured notes financing entered into by American in July 2009 (the 2009-2 Senior Secured Notes) and an EETC financing entered into by American in October 2011 (the Series 2011-2 Pass Through Certificates and, together with the Series 2009-1 Pass Through Certificates and the 2009-2 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Financings), in each case without the payment of any make-whole amount or other premium or prepayment penalty.


The Bankruptcy Court approved the motion on January 17, 2013 and entered an order (the EETC Order) to such effect on February 1, 2013. The trustees for the Existing Financings appealed the EETC Order and judgments rendered in certain related adversary proceedings. The appeals (the Appeals) were briefed and oral argument before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Second Circuit) was heard on June 20, 2013. On September 12, 2013, the Second Circuit fully affirmed the Company's right to repay the Existing Financings without the payment of any make-whole amount or other premium or prepayment penalty. On September 26, 2013, the trustees for the Existing Financings filed a petition for an en banc rehearing of the Appeals by the Second Circuit. On November 18, 2013, the Second Circuit denied such request for rehearing. On February 12, 2014, the trustees for the Existing Financings filed a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court. American intends to continue to assert vigorously its right to repay the Existing Financings without the payment of any make-whole amounts or other premium or prepayment penalty.

On July 31, 2013, the Company closed its private offering of the Refinancing EETC (the Series 2013-2A EETC) in the aggregate face amount of

$1.4 billion

with an interest rate of

4.95%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of January 15, 2023. In September 2013, American repaid the Existing Financings, including securities tendered to the Company under a tender offer for the Existing Financings that commenced on June 27, 2013, and received the proceeds from the Series 2013-2A EETC. In conjunction with the repayment of the Existing Financings, the Company incurred cash charges of

$19 million

, included in Interest expense, net of capitalized interest and a charge of

$54 million

, included in Miscellaneous, net, of which

$21 million

is cash, related to the premium on tender for the Existing Financings, and

$33 million

is non-cash, related to the write-off of unamortized issuance costs. The 2013-2A EETC represents an interest in the assets of a separate pass through trust, which will hold certain equipment notes issued by American. The Series 2013-2A EETC is secured by the same aircraft previously used to secure the Existing Financings. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

On November 27, 2013, American closed its private offering of Class B enhanced equipment trust certificates (the Series 2013-2B EETCs) in the aggregate face amount of

$512 million

. The Series 2013-2B EETCs rank junior to the Series 2013-2A EETCs. The Series 2013-2B EETCs were issued with an interest rate of

5.60%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of July 15, 2020. The 2013-2B EETCs represent an interest in the assets of a separate pass through trust, which will hold certain equipment notes issued by American. The Series 2013-2B EETCs are secured by the same aircraft securing the Series 2013-2A EETCs. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

On December 20, 2013, American closed its private offering of Class C enhanced equipment trust certificates (the Series 2013-2C EETCs) in the aggregate face amount of

$256 million

. The Series 2013-2C EETCs generally rank junior to the Series 2013-2A and 2B EETCs. The Series 2013-2C EETCs were issued with an interest rate of

6.00%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of January 15, 2017. The 2013-2C EETCs represent an interest in the assets of a separate pass through trust, which will hold certain equipment notes issued by American. The Series 2013-2C EETCs are secured by the same aircraft securing the Series 2013-2A and 2B EETCs. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

Credit Facilities (American)

On June 27, 2013, American and AAG entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with certain lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a

$1.9 billion

term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) and a

$1.0 billion

revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities). As of

December 31, 2013

, American had borrowed

$1.9 billion

under the Term Loan Facility. The Credit Facilities are secured obligations of American and guaranteed by AAG. The Revolving Facility provides that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder and have letters of credit issued thereunder in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of up to

$1.0 billion

. As of

December 31, 2013

, there were

no

borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

Upon consummation of the Merger, US Airways Group and US Airways joined the Credit Facilities as guarantors. Following the joinder, certain minimum dollar-thresholds under the negative and financial covenants in the Credit Facilities were automatically increased. The Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility mature on June 27, 2019 and June 27, 2018, respectively, unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties. The Term Loan Facility is repayable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to

0.25%

of the original principal amount thereof with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility.

Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time, with a premium of

1.00%

applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following December 27, 2013. Mandatory prepayments at par of term loans and revolving loans are required to the extent necessary to comply with American's covenants regarding the collateral


coverage ratio and certain dispositions of collateral. In addition, if a "change of control" (as defined in the Credit Agreement) occurs, American will, absent an amendment or waiver, be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities and terminate the Revolving Facility.

The Credit Facilities bear interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at American's option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of

0.75%

with respect to the Term Loan) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is

3.00%

for borrowings under both the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Credit Facilities are secured by certain collateral, including liens on certain route authorities to operate between certain specified cities, certain take-off and landing rights at certain airports and American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities as more fully described below in "Collateral Related Covenants".

The Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross-acceleration to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Credit Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. The Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than

$2.0 billion

and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.

Senior Secured Notes (American)

In March 2011, American issued

$1.0 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due


(the Senior Secured Notes) guaranteed on an unsecured basis by AAG. In connection with the closing of the Merger, US Airways and US Airways Group entered into a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 9, 2013, pursuant to which US Airways and US Airways Group became guarantors. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of

7.50%

per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2011. As is customary for financings of this nature, the indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of events of default under the related indenture. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes are secured by certain route authorities, airport landing and takeoff slots, and rights to use or occupy space in airport terminals, in each case that American uses to operate non-stop services between certain airports and American is required maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding amounts under the Senior Secured Notes as more fully described below in "Collateral Related Covenants."

American, at its option, may redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2013, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time prior to March 15, 2013, American, at its option, may redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to

100%

of their principal amount plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time prior to March 15, 2014, American, at its option, may redeem (1) up to

35%

of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of

107.5%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and (2) during any 12-month period, up to

10%

of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of

103%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If American sells certain assets or if a "change of control" (as defined in the indenture) occurs, American must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at prices specified in the indenture.

The indenture for the Senior Secured Notes includes covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends. The indenture for the Senior Secured Notes also contains events of default customary for similar financings, including cross-default to certain material indebtedness of American. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated and become due and payable.

Senior Convertible Notes (AMR Corporation)

On November 29, 2013, the substantially all holders of AMR Corporation's

6.25%

senior convertible notes elected to convert their notes into shares of AMR common stock (as an allowed AMR equity interest). Notes for which conversion was not elected prior to the deadline of November 29, 2013 remain in the pool of general unsecured claims to be settled pursuant to the Plan.


Other Financing Transactions (American)

In June 2013, American remarketed approximately

$216 million

of Tulsa Municipal Airport Revenue Refunding Bonds Trust Series 2000B, 2001A, and 2001B due June 1, 2035 (Series 2000B) and December 1, 2035 (Series 2001 A&B).

Citibank Advanced Purchase Agreement (American)

In


, American entered into an arrangement under which Citibank paid to American

$1.0 billion

in order to pre-purchase AAdvantage Miles (the Pre-Purchase Miles) under American's AAdvantage frequent flier loyalty program (the Pre-Purchase). Approximately

$890 million

of the Pre-Purchase proceeds was accounted for as a loan from Citibank with the remaining

$110 million

recorded as Deferred Revenue in Other liabilities and deferred credits.

To effect the Pre-Purchase, American and Citibank entered into an Amended and Restated AAdvantage Participation Agreement (as so amended and restated, the Amended Participation Agreement). Under the Amended Participation Agreement, American agreed that it would apply in equal monthly installments, over a

five

year period beginning on January 1, 2012, the Pre-Purchase Miles to Citibank cardholders' AAdvantage accounts.

Pursuant to the Pre-Purchase, Citibank has been granted a first-priority lien on certain of American's AAdvantage program assets. Commencing on December 31, 2011, American has the right to repay in cash, without premium or penalty, any or all of the amounts owed to Citibank that have not already been satisfied by the award of Pre-Purchase Miles to Citibank cardholders' accounts. American is also obligated, in certain circumstances (including certain specified termination events under the Amended Participation Agreement, certain cross defaults and cross acceleration events, and if any Pre-Purchase Miles remain at the end of the term) to repay in cash all outstanding amounts owed Citibank.

The Amended Participation Agreement includes provisions that grant Citibank the right to use Pre-Purchase Miles on an accelerated basis under specified circumstances.

2013 Citicorp Credit Facility (US Airways)

US Airways Group and certain other subsidiaries of US Airways Group are guarantors of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement dated as of May 23, 2013. In connection with the closing of the Merger, AAG and American entered into a joinder to the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility loan agreement pursuant to which AAG and American became guarantors under such agreement.

The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility consists of

$1.0 billion

of tranche B-1 term loans (Tranche B-1) and

$600 million

of tranche B-2 term loans (Tranche B-2). Voluntary prepayments may be made by US Airways Group at any time, with a premium of

1.00%

applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following January 16, 2014. Mandatory prepayments of the term loans are required to the extent necessary to comply with US Airways Group’s covenants regarding the collateral coverage ratio and certain dispositions of collateral. In addition, under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement, if a "change of control" (as defined in the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement) occurs, US Airways will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay the outstanding loans in full together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment.

The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement bears interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at US Airways' option, LIBOR (subject to an original floor of

1.00%

) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. As of December 31, 2013, the interest rate was

4.00%

based on a

3.00%

LIBOR margin for Tranche B-1 and

3.25%

based on a

2.25%

LIBOR margin for Tranche B-2.

In January 2014, US Airways amended the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement to lower the applicable LIBOR margin from

3.00%

to

2.75%

for Tranche B-1. In addition, the LIBOR floor was reduced from

1.00%

to

0.75%

on both Tranche B-1 and Tranche B-2.

Tranche B-1 and Tranche B-2 mature on May 23, 2019 and November 23, 2016, respectively (unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties), and each is repayable in annual installments to be paid on each anniversary of the closing date in an amount equal to

1.00%

of the initial aggregate principal amount of the loans with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the respective tranche.

The obligations of US Airways under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility are secured by liens on certain route authorities, certain take-off and landing rights at certain airports and certain other assets of US Airways. US Airways is required to maintain


a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement as more fully described below in "Collateral Related Covenants".

The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, (a) require AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain unrestricted liquidity of not less than

$2.0 billion

, with not less than

$750 million

held in accounts subject to control agreements, and (b) restrict the ability of US Airways Group, its subsidiaries party to the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, AAG and American to make certain investments, pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain acquisitions, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into certain hedging transactions, and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement contains events of default customary for similar financings, including a cross default provision to certain other material indebtedness of US Airways and certain of its affiliates. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately.

2013-1 EETCs (US Airways)

In April 2013, US Airways created

two

pass-through trusts which issued approximately

$820 million

aggregate face amount of Series 2013-1 Class A and Class B EETCs in connection with the financing of


Airbus aircraft scheduled to be delivered from September 2013 to June 2014. The 2013-1 EETCs represent fractional undivided interests in the respective pass-through trusts and are not obligations of US Airways. Proceeds received from the sale of EETCs are initially held by a depository in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until US Airways issues equipment notes to the trust, which purchases the notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by US Airways and are not reported as debt on US Airways' condensed balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not US Airways' assets.

As of December 31, 2013,

$261 million

of the escrowed proceeds from the 2013-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by US Airways in two series: Series A equipment notes in the amount of

$198 million

bearing interest at

3.95%

per annum and Series B equipment notes in the amount of

$63 million

bearing interest at

5.375%

per annum. Interest on the equipment notes is payable semiannually in May and November of each year, and began in November 2013. Principal payments on the equipment notes are scheduled to begin in November 2014. The final payments on the Series A and Series B equipment notes will be due in November 2025 and November 2021, respectively. US Airways' payment obligations under the equipment notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by US Airways Group. The net proceeds from the issuance of these equipment notes were used to finance

six

Airbus aircraft delivered in 2013. The equipment notes are secured by liens on aircraft. The remaining

$559 million

of escrowed proceeds will be used to purchase equipment notes as new aircraft are delivered.

2012-2 EETCs (US Airways)

The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2012-2 EETCs were used to purchase equipment notes issued by US Airways in three series: Series A equipment notes in the amount of

$418 million

bearing interest at

4.625%

per annum, Series B equipment notes in the amount of

$128 million

bearing interest at

6.75%

per annum and Series C equipment notes in the amount of

$100 million

bearing interest at

5.45%

per annum. Interest on the equipment notes is payable semiannually in June and December of each year and began in June 2013 for Series A and Series B, and December 2013 for Series C. Principal payments on the Series A and Series B equipment notes began in December 2013. The final payments on the Series A equipment notes, Series B equipment notes and Series C equipment notes will be due in June 2025, June 2021 and June 2018, respectively. US Airways' payment obligations under the equipment notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by US Airways Group. The only principal payments due on the Series C equipment notes are the principal payments that will be due on the final payment date. The net proceeds from the issuance of these equipment notes were used to finance


Airbus aircraft delivered from May 2013 through October 2013. The equipment notes are secured by liens on aircraft.

2012-1 EETCs (US Airways)

In the first quarter of 2013, US Airways issued

$183 million

of equipment notes in three series under its 2012-1 EETCs completed in May 2012: Series A equipment notes in the amount of

$111 million

bearing interest at

5.90%

per annum, Series B equipment notes in the amount of

$37 million

bearing interest at

8%

per annum and Series C equipment notes in the amount of

$35 million

bearing interest at

9.125%

per annum. The equipment notes are secured by liens on aircraft.


Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (US Airways)

The industrial development revenue bonds are due April 2023. Interest at

6.30%

is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1. The bonds are subject to optional redemption prior to the maturity date, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date at a redemption price of

100%

.

6.125% Senior Notes (US Airways)

The

6.125%

Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of

6.125%

per annum, which is payable semi-annually on each June 1 and December 1 and began December 1, 2013. The

6.125%

senior notes mature on June 1, 2018 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by US Airways. In connection with the closing of the Merger, AAG and American provided a full and unconditional guarantee of the payment obligations of US Airways Group under the

6.125%

senior notes. The

6.125%

senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company.

7.25% Convertible Notes (US Airways)

The

7.25%

notes bear interest at a rate of

7.25%

per annum, which shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15. The

7.25%

notes mature on May 15, 2014.

In connection with the closing of the Merger the

7.25%

notes have become convertible into cash, shares of AAG Common Stock or a combination thereof at the Company's election. AAG fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the payment obligations of US Airways Group under the

7.25%

notes.

Holders may convert their

7.25%

notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date for the

7.25%

notes. The initial conversion rate for the

7.25%

notes is

218.8184

shares of common stock per

$1,000

principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of

$4.57

per share). Such conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain events.

As the

7.25%

notes can be settled in cash upon conversion, for accounting purposes, the

7.25%

notes were bifurcated into a debt component that was initially recorded at fair value and an equity component. The following table details the debt and equity components recognized related to the

7.25%

notes (in millions):

At December 31, 2013, the remaining period over which the unamortized discount will be recognized is

0.4

years.

At December 31, 2013, the if-converted value of the

7.25%

notes exceeded the principal amount by

$101 million

.

Collateral Related Covenants

Certain of American's and US Airways’ debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require American and US Airways under their respective financing agreements to periodically appraise the collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, American or US Airways is required, as applicable, to subject additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part, with premium (if any), or pay additional interest on the related indebtedness, as described below.


Specifically, American is required to meet certain collateral coverage tests on a periodic basis on

two

financing transactions: (1) the Senior Secured Notes and (2) the Credit Facilities, and US Airways is required to meet a collateral coverage test on a periodic basis on the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, in each case as described below:

(1)

With respect to spare parts,

one

physical appraisal and

one

desktop appraisal are required in each fiscal year.

At

December 31, 2013

, the Company was in compliance with the most recently completed collateral coverage tests for the Senior Secured Notes, the Credit Facilities and the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility.

Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were

$713 million

,

$485 million

and

$747 million

for


,


and


, respectively.


. Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Fuel Price Risk Management

As of

December 31, 2013

, American had fuel derivative contracts outstanding covering

22 million

barrels of jet fuel that will be settled over the next

eighteen

months. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company has not entered into any fuel hedges since the Effective Date and its current policy is not to do so.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. Derivatives that meet the requirements are granted special hedge accounting treatment, and the Company’s hedges generally meet these requirements. Accordingly, the Company’s fuel derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, and the fair value of the Company’s hedging contracts is recorded in Current Assets or Current Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the underlying jet fuel is purchased. The Company determines the ineffective portion of its fuel hedge contracts by comparing the cumulative change in the total value of the fuel hedge contract, or group of fuel hedge contracts, to the cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel hedge. If the total cumulative change in value of the fuel hedge contract more than offsets the total cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel hedge, the difference is considered ineffective and is immediately recognized as a component of Aircraft fuel expense. Effective gains or losses on fuel hedging contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings as a component of Aircraft fuel expense when the underlying jet fuel being hedged is used.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related commodities. The Company assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. In doing so, the



Company uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g., NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel. The Company also monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges’ market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be "highly effective" if the R-squared is greater than

80%

and the dollar offset correlation is within

80%

to

125%

. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to discontinue the hedging relationship. Subsequently, any changes in the fair value of these derivatives are marked to market through earnings in the period of change.

For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, American recognized net gains/(losses) of approximately

$(12) million

,

$4 million

and

$341 million

, respectively, as a component of Aircraft fuel expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to its fuel hedging agreements, including the ineffective portion of the hedges. The net fair value of the Company’s fuel hedging agreements at

December 31, 2013

and


, representing the amount American would receive upon termination of the agreements (net of settled contract assets), totaled

$107 million

and

$62 million

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2013

, American estimates that during the next

twelve months

it will reclassify from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings approximately

$45 million

in net

gains

(based on prices as of

December 31, 2013

) related to its fuel derivative hedges.

The impact of aircraft fuel derivative instruments (all cash flow hedges) on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations is depicted below (in millions):

(1)    Includes the effective portion of hedge gain (loss)

(2)    Includes the ineffective portion of hedge gain (loss)

(3)    Includes the effective and ineffective portion of hedge gain (loss)

The impact of aircraft fuel derivative instruments (all cash flow hedges) on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income is depicted below (in millions):

(1)    Includes the effective portion of hedge gain (loss)



While certain of the Company's fuel derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting agreements with its counterparties, the Company does not offset its fuel derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain of these agreements would also allow for the offsetting of fuel derivatives with interest rate derivatives. The impact of aircraft fuel derivative instruments (all cash flow hedges) on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the impact of offsetting aircraft fuel derivative instruments, is depicted below (in millions):

(1)

Fuel derivative assets are included in Fuel derivative contracts on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2)

Fuel derivative liabilities are included in Accrued liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(3)

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company had posted cash collateral of an immaterial amount.

The Company is also exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these financial instruments, and although no assurances can be given, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date, reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. To manage credit risks, the Company selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. The Company also maintains industry-standard security agreements with a number of its counterparties which may require the Company or the counterparty to post collateral if the value of selected instruments exceeds specified mark-to-market thresholds or upon certain changes in credit ratings. The amount of collateral required to be posted from time to time may be substantial.



Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt classified as Level 2 were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company’s current estimated incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. All of the Company’s long term debt not classified as subject to compromise is classified as Level 2.

In connection with the Merger, US Airways debt was recorded at fair value using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations". See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The carrying value and estimated fair values of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, not classified as subject to compromise, were (in millions):

The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, classified as subject to compromise, were (in millions):

All of the Company’s long term debt classified as subject to compromise as of

December 31, 2012

is classified as Level 2.

The Company is also party to certain interest rate swap agreements that are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Ineffectiveness for these instruments is required to be measured at each reporting period. The ineffectiveness and fair value associated with all of the Company's interest rate cash flow hedges for all periods presented was not material.




. Income Taxes

The significant components of the income tax provision (benefit) were (in millions):

The income tax expense (benefit) differed from amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate as follows (in millions):

The merger of US Airways into American Airlines Group Inc. closed on December 9, 2013. For the period beginning on December 9, 2013 and ending on

December 31, 2013

, US Airways Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries are now included in the AAG consolidated federal and state income tax returns.

The Company recorded a net income tax benefit of

$346 million

which is composed of a

$538 million

non-cash income tax benefit, a

$214 million

tax charge for additional valuation allowance, and

$22 million

income tax credit. The Company recorded a

$538 million

non-cash income tax benefit from continuing operations during the fourth quarter of 2013. Under current accounting rules, the Company is required to consider all items (including items recorded in other comprehensive income) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the year, which is exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders' equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations for this item, the Company's year-end net deferred tax position is not impacted by this tax allocation. The Company recorded similar amounts when reporting other comprehensive income in 2009 and 2012. The resulting residual income tax expense will remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) until all amounts in AOCI that relate to the plan or program that gave rise to the residual income taxes are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company will reclassify to earnings all residual tax amounts relating to our Pension and Retiree Medical Liability (specifically relating to Pension and OPEB activity) and Derivative Financial Instruments (specifically relating to Fuel Hedging Contracts activity) in the period in which there are no longer any amounts in AOCI associated with those plans or programs. The Company anticipates recognizing a non-cash income tax expense of

$313 million

in continuing operations during


upon the settlement of the currently outstanding Fuel Hedging Contract arrangements.

The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers



whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax assets, will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (primarily reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible. The assessment of realization of deferred tax assets considers those tax planning strategies that management believes to be prudent and feasible strategies the Company would implement, if necessary, to prevent a tax attribute from expiring. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a

$214 million

tax charge attributable to additional valuation allowance required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. US Airways, Group Inc is required under ASC 805, as a result of its merger, to use purchase accounting to establish the fair values of its assets and liabilities. The resulting tax accounting establishes a federal deferred tax liability for its indefinite-lived assets in the amount of

$306 million

which has been accounted for through goodwill.

A portion of the change in the valuation allowance reflects the recording by the Company in


,


and


of an income tax expense (credit) of approximately

$(22) million

,

$0 million

and

$(25) million

, respectively, resulting from the Company’s elections under applicable sections of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012), allowing corporations to accelerate utilization of certain research and alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.

In addition to the changes in the valuation allowance from operations described in the table above, the valuation allowance was also impacted by the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), described in Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements. The total increase in the valuation allowance was

$602 million

,

$263 million

, and

$1.2 billion

in


,


and


, respectively.

The components of AAG's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):

At

December 31, 2013

, the Company had available for federal income tax purposes an AMT credit carryforward of approximately

$370 million

, which is available for an indefinite period, and federal net operating losses of approximately

$10.6 billion

for regular tax purposes, which will expire, if unused, beginning in


. These net operating losses include an unrealized benefit of approximately

$762 million

related to the implementation of share-based compensation accounting guidance that will be recorded in equity when realized. The Company had available for state income tax purposes net operating losses of

$4.7 billion

, which expire, if unused, in years


through


. The amount that will expire in


is

$106 million

if not used.

We experienced a statutory "ownership change" on December 9, 2013 as defined for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and US Airways Group experienced an ownership



change in connection with the Merger. When a company undergoes such an ownership change, Section 382 limits the company’s future ability to utilize any NOL generated before the ownership change and certain subsequently recognized "built-in" losses and deductions, if any, existing as of the date of the ownership change. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where an ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We anticipate taking advantage of these certain special rules which will permit approximately

$9.0 billion

of our federal NOL carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. At December 31, 2013, the Company inherited the US Airways Group approximate

$1.6 billion

of NOLs (

$1.4 billion

of which is subject to Section 382 limitation due to the ownership change) to reduce the Company’s future taxable income. The majority of American Airlines Group Inc.’s NOLs are expected to be available to reduce federal taxable income in the calendar year 2014. The Company’s ability to utilize any new NOL arising after the ownership change is not affected.

The Company files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company’s 2004 through 2012 tax years are still subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination and the Company is under examination, in administrative appeals, or engaged in tax litigation in certain jurisdictions. The Company believes that the effect of any additional assessment(s) will be immaterial to its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash payments for income taxes were

$12 million

,

$6 million

and

$1 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

Under special tax rules (the Section 382 Limitation), cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceeding 50% during a rolling 3-year period can potentially limit a company’s future use of net operating losses and tax credits. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors -

"Our ability to utilize our net operating losses (NOL) carryforwards may be limited."

The Company has an unrecognized tax benefit of approximately

$6 million

, which did not change during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Changes in the unrecognized tax benefit have no impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. Accrued interest on tax positions is recorded as a component of interest expense but was not significant at December 31, 2013.

The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefit are (in millions):

The Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefit will not significantly change within the next twelve months.


. Share Based Compensation

In December 2013, the Board of Directors of AAG approved the 2013 AAG Incentive Award Plan (the 2013 Plan). Awards may be in the form of an option, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award, performance award, dividend equivalent award, deferred stock award, deferred stock unit award, stock payment award or stock appreciation right. The 2013 Plan authorizes the grant of awards for the issuance of

40 million

shares plus any shares underlying awards granted under the 2013 Plan, or any pre-existing US Airways Group plan, that are forfeited, terminate or are cash settled (in whole or in part) without a payment being made in the form of shares. In addition, any shares that are available for issuance under the US Airways Group 2011 Incentive Award Plan (the 2011 Plan) as of the effective date of the Merger may be used for awards under the 2013 Plan; provided, that awards using such available shares under the 2011 Plan shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under 2011 Plan and shall only be made to individuals who were not providing services to AAG prior to the Merger. Award granted under the 2013 Plan upon the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, will not reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2013 Plan.

In addition, pursuant to the Plan, and as approved by the Bankruptcy Court,

certain officers, directors and employees received share-based incentive awards, Alignment and Equity Incentive, related to the Merger and future service. Awards issued in conjunction with the Plan are discussed in more detail below.

All outstanding US Airways Group equity awards were converted into equity awards with respect to AAG Common Stock using an exchange ratio of


to 1 and had a fair value of approximately

$141 million

at the Merger which was included in the purchase price. These awards have the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such equity awards immediately prior to the merger closing date.

For time vested awards, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award. For awards with performance conditions, the expense is recognized based on the expected achievement at each reporting period. Stock-settled restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) are classified as equity awards as the vesting results in the issuance of shares of AAG Common Stock.

US Airways Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights

Stock options and stock appreciation rights are granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying common stock’s fair value at the date of each grant. Stock options and stock appreciation rights have service conditions, become exercisable over a

three

-year vesting period and expire if unexercised at the end of their term, which ranges from

seven

to

ten

years. Stock options and stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) are classified as equity awards as the exercise results in the issuance of shares of AAG Common Stock. Cash-settled stock appreciation rights (CSARs) are classified as liability awards as the exercise results in payment of cash by the Company.

Stock option and SAR award activity for all plans effective with the Merger date is as follows:

CSAR award activity for all plans effective with the Merger Date is as follows:

The fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights is determined at the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires several assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the award at the time of grant. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero as the Company does not pay dividends. The volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over a time period equal to the expected term of the award. The expected term of the award is based on the historical experience of the Company. Stock options and stock appreciation rights are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award. There were no stock options or stock appreciation rights granted subsequent to the Merger closing date.



As of

December 31, 2013

, there were

$22 million

of total unrecognized compensation costs related to SARs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

AMR Incentive Awards

Prior to the Petition Date, AMR adopted certain plans which provided for the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and other share-based awards. AMR granted stock compensation under three plans: the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 1998 Plan), the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the 2003 Plan) and the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). Collectively, the 1998 Plan and the 2009 Plan are referred to as the LTIP Plans. No awards were made under AMR's plans in 2012 or 2013. AMR had share-based incentive awards including stock options/stock appreciation rights granted under the LTIP Plans and the 2003 Plan, performance share awards granted under the LTIP plans and based upon a requisite service period and contingently issuable based upon the AMR's relative stock price performance compared to certain of its competitors over a three year period, deferred share awards granted under the LTIP plans and based solely on a requisite service period and career equity awards granted to certain employees of AMR vesting upon the retirement of those individuals. Deferred share and career equity awards totaling

5,899,500

shares vested in AMR common stock pursuant to the Plan. These plan participants become holders of interest in AMR Corporation and will receive distributions of AAG common stock in accordance with the Plan (See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Plan). All remaining outstanding awards were canceled in accordance with the Plan upon emergence from Chapter 11.

Activity of all previous AMR awards is as follows:


. Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for eligible employees. The defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its defined benefit plans. In addition, the Company provides certain postemployment benefits to its employees. These benefits include disability-related and workers' compensation benefits for certain employees. The Company accrues for the cost of such benefit expenses once an appropriate triggering event has occurred.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company's estimate of the long-term rate of return on plan assets was

8.00%

based on the target asset allocation. Expected returns on longer duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are based on a combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and expected value to be generated through active management, currency overlay and securities lending programs. The Company's annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets as of

December 31, 2013

, was approximately

8.93%

.

The objectives of the Company's investment policies are to: maintain sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement benefits; produce a long-term rate of return that meets or exceeds the assumed rate of return for plan assets; limit the volatility of asset performance and funded status; and diversify assets among asset classes and investment managers.

Based on these investment objectives, a long-term strategic asset allocation has been established. This strategic allocation seeks to balance the potential benefit of improving funded position with the potential risk that the funded position would decline. The current strategic target asset allocation is as follows:

Each asset class is actively managed and, historically, the plans' assets have produced returns, net of management fees, in excess of the expected rate of return over the last ten years. Public equity and emerging market fixed income securities are used to provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the long-term than longer duration U.S. bonds. Public stocks are managed using a value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. Longer duration U.S. bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. Additionally, the Company engages currency overlay managers in an attempt to increase returns by protecting non-U.S. dollar denominated assets from a rise in the relative value of the U.S. dollar. The Company also participates in securities lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis. These programs are subject to market risk.

Investments in securities traded on recognized securities exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the last bid price. The money market fund is valued at fair value which represents the net asset value of the shares of such fund as of the close of business at the end of the period. Investments in limited partnerships are carried at estimated net asset value as determined by and reported by the



general partners of the partnerships and represent the proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships. Common/collective trusts are valued at net asset value based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the trusts as determined by the sponsor of the trusts. The 103-12 investment trust is valued at net asset value which is determined by the issuer at the end of each month and is based on the aggregate fair value of trust assets less liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the period.

st

Century Act of 2012. In 2013 the Company contributed

$489 million

to its defined benefit pension plans, which covered minimum contributions for periods prior to the Company’s Chapter 11 filing and periods thereafter (see Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), as well as certain interest and penalty interest due with respect to contributions for pre-petition periods. On

January 15, 2014

Modifications to Retirement and Life Insurance Benefits

Effective November 1, 2012, the Company's defined benefit pension plans were frozen and eligible employees began to receive a replacement benefit under the $uper $aver 401(k) Plan. The Company matches employee contributions up to

5.5%

of eligible earnings and, with the ratification of a new CBA by pilots on December 7, 2012, pilots receive contributions of

14%

under the same plan.

In December 2012, the Pilot A Plan, a defined benefit plan, was amended to remove the lump-sum option and the installment option forms of benefit effective December 31, 2012. A small group of American pilots is appealing the Bankruptcy Court's decision authorizing American to eliminate the lump sum option and installment option forms of benefit. This is the same group of pilots that is appealing the Bankruptcy Court's decisions authorizing American to reject the pilot CBA and approve the new pilot CBA. All of these appeals have been consolidated, and are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

The Pilot B Plan, a defined contribution plan, was terminated on November 30, 2012. With the exception of a small residual balance to cover final plan expenses, we expect all remaining funds, which represent a small group of uncashed distribution checks, to be distributed by the end of second quarter 2014.



On July 6, 2012, the Company commenced an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court seeking a determination on the issue of vesting for former employees who retired before November 1, 2012 and were eligible for certain retiree medical coverage. The Court held a hearing on January 23, 2013 and has not ruled on this matter as of the date of this report. The Company has been negotiating with the retiree committee since July 2012, seeking a consensual agreement to terminate subsidized retiree medical coverage and life insurance coverage.

As a result of the modifications to the retirement benefits as discussed above, a portion of the pension and postretirement benefits liability, primarily relating to retiree medical and other benefits, was classified as liabilities subject to compromise as of December 31, 2012. This amount was reinstated upon emergence since there was no resolution in the Chapter 11 Cases. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements for the breakout of liabilities subject to compromise, including that related to pension and postretirement benefits.

Curtailment and Plan Amendment in the Third Quarter of 2012

In accordance with ASC 715 "Retirement Benefits" (ASC 715), in the third quarter of 2012, the Company remeasured its defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a result of modifications to its retirement plans and reductions in certain work groups (see above and Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company updated its significant actuarial assumptions used for the remeasurements including the discount rate, which was lowered to

4.10%

and

3.80%

for the defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical plans, respectively.

The remeasurement of the defined benefit plans resulted in an actuarial loss of

$1.9 billion

offset by a curtailment gain of

$1.8 billion

. In addition, a loss of

$58 million

, representing unamortized prior service cost as of the remeasurement date of the frozen defined benefit plans, is included as a component of reorganization items, net.

Further, as a result of modifications to its retiree medical plans, the Company recognized a negative plan amendment of

$1.9 billion

, which is included as a component of actuarial gain arising in current year in other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the future service life of the active plan participants for whom the benefit was eliminated, or approximately

eight

years. In addition, a net credit of

$124 million

, representing unamortized prior service credits of

$157 million

offset by a curtailment loss of

$33 million

, is included as a component of reorganization items, net.


. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows (in millions):

As of

December 31, 2013

) related to its fuel derivative hedges.



Reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended

non-cash income tax benefit, offset by a

$538 million

charge to other comprehensive income, during the fourth quarter of 2013 related to gains in other comprehensive income. Also, the Company recognized a

$569 million

non-cash income tax benefit, offset by a

$569 million

charge to other comprehensive income, during the fourth quarter of 2012 related to gains in other comprehensive income. See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Amounts allocated to other comprehensive income for income taxes as further described in Note


will remain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) until the Company ceases all related activities, such as termination of the pension plan.


. Segment Reporting

The Company's operations of American, US Airways, AMR Eagle, Piedmont and PSA are treated as an integrated route network and the route scheduling system maximizes the operating results of the Company. The Company's chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions to maximize the Company's consolidated financial results. Based on the way the Company treats the network and the manner in which resource allocation decisions are made, the Company has only one operating segment for financial reporting purposes consisting of the operations of American, US Airways, AMR Eagle, Piedmont and PSA.

Revenues from other segments are below the quantitative threshold for determining reportable segments and consist primarily of revenues from Americas Ground Services, Inc. The difference between the financial information of the Company's one reportable segment and the financial information included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets as a result of these entities is not material.

The Company's operating revenues by geographic region (as defined by DOT) are summarized below (in millions):

The Company attributes operating revenues by geographic region based upon the origin and destination of each flight segment. The Company's tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which are mobile across geographic markets and, therefore, have not been allocated.

The Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding for all quarters presented include the weighted effect of shares outstanding for both the pre and post-merger periods. The shares outstanding for the pre-merger periods (January 1, 2012 through December 8, 2013) consist only of the AMR common stock formerly traded under the symbol: "AAMRQ". In accordance with GAAP, these former AAMRQ shares have been adjusted for all periods presented to retrospectively reflect the two initial distributions made to date pursuant to the Company’s Plan, whereby holders of AAMRQ received shares of AAG Common Stock on the Effective Date, January 9, 2014 and February 10, 2014. The shares outstanding for the 23 day post-merger period (December 9, 2013 through December 31, 2013) include the full amount of shares to be issued pursuant to the Plan over the 120 day distribution period adjusted for the approximate

13 million

shares withheld by the Company in satisfaction of employee tax obligations.

Former AAMRQ holders as of the Effective Date have and may in the future receive additional distributions based on the trading price of AAL common stock during the remaining 120 day period after the effective date and the total amount of allowed claims, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Accordingly, the Company’s common shares outstanding and related GAAP basic and diluted EPS reported herein for all periods presented may change in the future, including amounts reported herein, to reflect additional retrospective adjustments for future common stock distributions to former holders of AAMRQ.

756 million

new shares of American Airlines Group Inc. common stock was authorized to satisfy allowed unsecured claims, labor-related deemed claims, and former AMR Corporation shareholder interests; to consummate the Merger; and to issue shares pursuant to the AAG Incentive Plans. As of the Effective Date, a combination of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and other bankruptcy settlement obligations were issued or placed into effect to satisfy allowed unsecured claims, labor-related deemed claims, and former AMR Corporation shareholder interests. As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

261 million

shares were issued by the Company primarily to consummate the Merger, distribute a specified number of initial shares to holders of labor-related deemed claims and former AMR Corporation shareholder interests, and to issue shares pursuant to the AAG Incentive Plans. Additionally, as of the Effective Date, the Company paid approximately

$300 million

in cash for employee withholding taxes in lieu of issuing shares which reduced the total number of shares to be issued pursuant to the Plan by approximately

13 million

.

As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

463 million

shares remain to be distributed pursuant to the Plan upon the conversion of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and to satisfy other bankruptcy settlement obligations related to allowed unsecured claims, including disputed claims, labor-related deemed claims and legacy AMR common stock shareholders. After the issuances of AAG Common Stock upon conversion of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and after the issuance of AAG Common Stock to satisfy the claim-related other bankruptcy settlement obligations, to the extent that any shares of AAG Common Stock remain undistributed, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed pro-rata to former AMR Corporation shareholders as of the Effective Date. Therefore approximately

743 million

shares will have been distributed, however, the Company may on future distributions to employees remit cash for employee withholding taxes in lieu of distributing shares. Accordingly, as of the Effective Date, although undistributed shares are not yet issued and outstanding, all conditions of distribution except the



passage of time have been met and such shares are considered issued and are included in our calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share.

The cancellation of all shares of our common stock outstanding prior to the Effective Date and subsequent issuance of, pursuant to the Plan, AAG Common Stock to former AMR Corporation shareholder interests, represents a share exchange with the Company's owners that is accounted for as a reverse stock split applicable to all financial statement periods prior to the Effective Date. Accordingly, weighted average shares outstanding for all periods presented prior to the Effective Date include only the weighted average of common shares previously outstanding (traded as AAMRQ) which have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. The retroactive adjustment for periods prior to the Effective Date has been made at a rate of

0.3735

shares of AAG Common Stock for each previously held share of AAMRQ, based upon all distributions to former AMR Corporation shareholder interests that have been made on or since the Effective Date, including those made on December 9, 2013, January 9, 2014, and February 10th, 2014. The shares outstanding for the 23 day post-merger period (December 9, 2013 through December 31, 2013) include the full amount of shares to be issued pursuant to the Plan over the 120 day distribution period adjusted for the approximately

13 million

shares withheld by the Company in satisfaction of employee tax obligations.

Former AAMRQ holders as of the effective date have and may in the future receive additional distributions based on the trading price of AAL common stock during the remaining 120 day period after the effective date and the total amount of allowed claims, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Further stock splits will occur as additional shares of AAG Common Stock are distributed to former AMR Corporation shareholders. Accordingly, the Company's common shares outstanding and related basic and diluted earnings per share reported herein for all periods presented may change in the future.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in millions, except per share amounts in thousands):

The year ended

December 31, 2013

does not include the impact of post-petition interest recorded in first quarter of 2013. If such amounts were included, results would have been anti-dilutive and conversion would not have been assumed.




. Stockholders' Equity

Common Stock

Pursuant to the Plan, all securities of AMR Corporation outstanding prior to December 9, 2013 were canceled. In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, the Company began issuing shares of AAG Common Stock, par value

$0.01

per share, pursuant to the Plan. The AAG Common Stock is subject to the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation, which supersedes the Certificate of Incorporation in effect prior to the Effective Date.

The New Certificate authorizes us to issue a total of

1.75 billion

shares of common stock. The Plan contemplates the issuance of up to

756 million

shares of AAG Common Stock, consisting of

212 million

shares to holders of US Airways Group common stock and other equity interests immediately prior to the Merger, up to

544 million

shares to holders of allowed general, unsecured claims and holders of AMR equity interests immediately prior to emergence, and certain non-contract, non-management employees. The Plan also contemplates the issuance of up to

40 million

shares of common stock to certain officers and directors under the 2013 Incentive Award Program (2013 IAP). For additional information regarding the distribution of new common stock under the Plan, see Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table below presents activity for the AAG Common Stock for the year ended

December 31, 2013

(in thousands):

Holders of AAG common stock are entitled to

one

vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of common shareholders, except that voting rights of non-U.S. citizens are limited to the extent that the shares of common stock held by such non-U.S. persons would otherwise be entitled to more than

24.9%

of the aggregate votes of all outstanding equity securities of US Airways Group.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


. Nature of Operations and Operating Environment

American Airlines, Inc. (American) is a Delaware corporation whose primary business activity is the operation of a major network air carrier. American is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG or the Company; formerly AMR Corporation), which owns all of American's outstanding common stock, par value

$1.00

per share.

Prior to the Merger, as discussed below, American operated the third largest airline in the U.S. as measured by revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and available seat miles (ASMs). American operates in five primary domestic markets: Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City. American operates nearly

1,811

flights per day to


destinations in


countries. In


, American had approximately

87 million

passengers boarding its flights. As of

December 31, 2013

, American operated


mainline jets. American is supported by AAG's wholly-owned regional airline subsidiary and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle under capacity purchase agreements.

As of

December 31, 2013

, American employed approximately

60,000

active full-time equivalent employees, of which approximately

69.2%

are covered by CBAs with various labor unions. American's pilots and flight attendants are currently working under the terms of their respective CBAs, as modified by transition agreements reached in connection with the Merger in December 2013.


. Emergence From Chapter 11

Overview

On November 29, 2011 (the Petition Date), AMR Corporation (renamed American Airlines Group Inc., AAG, the Company), its principal subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc. (American), and certain of the Company's other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors), filed voluntary petitions for relief (the Chapter 11 Cases) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order) approving and confirming the Debtors' fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan).

On December 9, 2013 (the Effective Date), the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement), dated as of February 13, 2013, by and among the Company, AMR Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) and US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group (the Merger), with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company following the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock, par value

$0.01

per share, of US Airways Group was converted into the right to receive

one

share of American Airlines Group common stock (AAG Common Stock), par value

$0.01

per share.

From the Petition Date through the Effective Date, pursuant to automatic stay provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and orders granted by the Bankruptcy Court, all actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors generally were stayed. Following the Effective Date, actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date generally have been permanently enjoined. Any unresolved claims will continue to be subject to the claims reconciliation process under the supervision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. However, certain pending litigation related to pre-petition liabilities may proceed in courts other than the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to the extent the parties to such litigation have obtained relief from the permanent injunction.

Plan of Reorganization

The Plan implements the Merger and incorporates a compromise and settlement of certain intercreditor and intercompany claim issues.

Pursuant to the Plan, all shares of AMR Corporation common stock outstanding prior to the Effective Date were canceled. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which was approved in connection with the Plan, authorizes the issuance of

1.75 billion

new shares of AAG Common Stock, par value

$0.01

per share, and

200 million

shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock, par value

$0.01

per share. Of the authorized AAG Series A Preferred Stock, approximately

168 million

were designated "Series A Convertible Preferred Stock", with a stated value

$25.00

per share, and issued in accordance with the Plan. AAG Common Stock and AAG Series A Preferred Stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols "AAL"



and "AALCP", respectively, and began trading on December 9, 2013. In addition, pursuant to the Plan, up to

40 million

shares of AAG Common Stock was authorized for issuance under the 2013 Incentive Award Plan (the 2013 IAP).

The Plan contains the following provisions relating to the treatment of pre-petition claims against the Debtors and other holders of allowed interests in the Debtors including AMR Corporation and American:

•

all secured claims against the Debtors have been reinstated;

•

allowed administrative claims, priority claims and convenience claims have been or will be paid in full in cash;

•

other holders of allowed pre-petition unsecured claims, holders of allowed interests and certain employees of AMR received or will receive

72%

of AAG Common Stock (on a fully converted basis) authorized to be issued pursuant to the Plan and in connection with the Merger under the following provisions:

◦

all creditors holding general unsecured claims against American that are guaranteed by AAG and general unsecured claims against AAG that are guaranteed by American (Double-Dip Unsecured Claims) were treated the same under the Plan. Holders of Double-Dip Unsecured Claims received, at the Effective Date, their recovery in shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock with a stated amount equal to the allowed amount of their claims, including post-petition interest at the non-default rate;

◦

all creditors holding Single-Dip Unsecured Claims were treated the same regardless of whether the claim was asserted against the AAG Debtors, the American Debtors, or other Debtors. As used herein, "Single-Dip Unsecured Claims" means the general unsecured claims against the Debtors that are not guaranteed by any other Debtor, other than the claims of the Debtors' labor unions. Holders of Single-Dip Unsecured Claims received, at the Effective Date, a portion of their recovery in shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and a right, subject to the trading price of the Company's common stock during the 120 day period after the Effective Date, to receive their remaining recovery in shares of AAG Common Stock 120 days after the Effective Date;

◦

holders of certain labor-related deemed claims and certain non-management, non-union employees as specified in the Plan received, at the Effective Date, the right to receive an allocation of shares of AAG Common Stock representing

23.6%

of the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock ultimately distributed to holders of pre-petition general unsecured creditors against the Debtors. On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, an initial allocation of approximately

39 million

shares of AAG Common Stock was made related to these labor and employee groups, of which approximately

27 million

shares were distributed on the Effective Date and approximately

13 million

shares of which were withheld in connection with the Company making a cash payment of approximately

$300 million

for certain required withholding taxes;

◦

holders of allowed interests in AMR Corporation (primarily holders of AMR Corporation common stock existing immediately prior to the Effective Date) received, at the Effective Date, a distribution of approximately

26 million

shares of AAG Common Stock representing

3.5%

of the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock contemplated for issuance pursuant to the Plan and, will receive additional shares of AAG Common Stock if, among other considerations, the trading price of the Company's common stock at various points during the 120 day period after the Effective Date provides for a full recovery to claimholders and other allowed priority interests; and

◦

holders of disputed claims at the Effective Date, to the extent such disputed claims become allowed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims after the Effective Date, are eligible to receive shares of AAG Common Stock held in reserve (Disputed Claims Reserve), beginning after 120 days after the Effective Date. Disputed claimholders that subsequently become Single-Dip Unsecured Claimholders will receive, subject to the availability of sufficient shares in the Disputed Claims Reserve, the number of shares of AAG Common Stock that the Disputed claimholder would have received had such claimholder been a Single-Dip Unsecured Claimholder as of the Effective Date.

The Plan contemplates the distribution of up to

756 million

shares of common stock of which approximately

53 million

shares were issued to the Debtors' stakeholders in connection with the Effective Date. In accordance with the Plan, the Company will issue the remaining shares of AAG Common Stock over the 120 day distribution period and as disputed claims are resolved. In addition, pursuant to the Plan approximately

197 million

common shares were distributed to holders of outstanding shares of US Airways Group common stock.

Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan has established a disputed claim reserve to hold shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and AAG Common Stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders that ultimately become allowed Single-Dip general unsecured claimholders after emergence. The shares provided for under the Plan are determined based upon a disputed claim reserve amount of approximately

$755 million

, representing the maximum amount of additional allowable Single-Dip claims under the Plan's provisions. Approximately

16 million

shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock have been



reserved at the Effective Date for distribution to holders of disputed Single-Dip general unsecured claims whose claims ultimately become allowed. Additional new shares of AAG Common Stock will be distributed into the reserve on or about the 120th day after the Effective Date. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of the remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to AAG but rather will be distributed by priority first, if necessary, to satisfy unsecured claims or labor-related obligations, and then to former AMR shareholders as of the Effective Date.

AAG is not required to distribute additional shares above the

756 million

shares contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay all allowed unsecured claims. However, resolution of disputed claims could have a material effect on Single-Dip creditor recoveries under the Plan and the amount of additional share distributions, if any, that are made to former AMR shareholders as the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock that remain available for distribution upon resolution of disputed claims is limited pursuant to the Plan.

In addition, as of

December 31, 2013

, American made the following cash disbursements under the Plan:

•

$385 million

in cash to the Pension plans in connection with missed contributions to the pension plans during Chapter 11 and interest and penalty interest thereon;

•

$105 million

to holders in partial or full satisfaction of their claims, including to holders of administrative claims, and state and local priority tax claims;

•

$196 million

in cure payments to holders of secured debt; and

•

Approximately

$300 million

for payroll taxes associated with equity distributions to employees

Several parties have filed appeals seeking reconsideration of the Confirmation Order. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

As noted above, the reconciliation process with respect to the remaining claims will take considerable additional time post emergence. Included in Claim and other bankruptcy settlement obligations on American's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2013

, are American's estimates of the amounts of disputed claims that will ultimately become allowed Single-Dip general unsecured claims. As these claims are resolved, or where better information becomes available and is evaluated, AAG will make adjustments to the liabilities recorded in American's Consolidated Financial Statements as appropriate. Any such adjustments could be material to American's financial position or results of operations in any given period.

Availability and Utilization of Net Operating Losses

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company experienced an "ownership change" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code which could potentially limit the ability to utilize certain tax attributes including the Company’s substantial NOLs. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. While the Company anticipates taking advantage of certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that would permit approximately

$9.5 billion

of the federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382, there can be no assurance that these special rules will apply.

Moreover, an ownership change subsequent to the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy may further limit or effectively eliminate the ability to utilize the Company’s NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the Company’s ability to utilize the NOL Carryforwards, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial shareholders. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, there can be no assurance that an ownership change will not occur even with these transfer restrictions. A copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation was attached as Exhibit 3.1 to a Form 8-K filed on December 9, 2013 by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Liabilities Subject to Compromise

Liabilities subject to compromise refers to pre-petition obligations which may be impacted by the Chapter 11 reorganization process. These amounts represent the Debtors' current estimate of known or potential pre-petition obligations to be resolved in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.

Pursuant to the Plan, American's allowed pre-petition claims and estimated unresolved pre-petition claims of

$4.6 billion

were settled in cash, AAG Series A Preferred Stock and other bankruptcy settlement obligations on the Effective Date. The pension and postretirement benefits obligation included below was reinstated and is included in "Pension and postretirement



benefits" in American's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly there are no Liabilities Subject to Compromise at

December 31, 2013

.

The following table summarizes the components of liabilities subject to compromise included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2012

(in millions):

(1)

As a result of the modifications to the retirement benefits as discussed in Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements, a portion of the pension and postretirement benefits liability, primarily relating to retiree medical and other benefits, was classified as liabilities subject to compromise.

Long-term debt, including undersecured debt, classified as subject to compromise as of

December 31, 2012

consisted of (in millions):

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred in the Chapter 11 Cases. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


(in millions):

(1)

Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. American recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing or facility agreements when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim.

(2)

Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended

December 31, 2013

, American recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of

$180 million

, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.

(3)

The Plan allows unsecured creditors receiving Preferred Stock a conversion discount of

3.5%

. Accordingly, American recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court.




. Bankruptcy Settlement Obligations

As of

December 31, 2013

, the components of "Claims and other bankruptcy settlement obligations" on American's Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows (in millions):

As a mechanism for satisfying Double-Dip Unsecured Claims and a portion of Single-Dip Unsecured Claims, the Plan of Reorganization provided that such claimholders receive the mandatorily convertible AAG Series A Preferred Stock. AAG's Series A Preferred Stock, while outstanding, votes and participates in accordance with the terms of the underlying Certificate of Designation. One quarter of the shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock is mandatorily convertible on each of the 30

th

, 60

th

, 90

th

and 120

th

days after the Effective Date. In addition, subject to certain limitations, holders of AAG Series A Preferred Stock may elect to convert up to

10 million

shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock during each 30-day period following the Effective Date thereby reducing the number of AAG Series A Preferred Stock to be converted on the 120

th

day after the Effective Date. The initial stated value of each share of AAG Series A Preferred Stock is

$25.00

and accrues dividends at

6.25%

per annum, calculated daily, while outstanding. Additionally, AAG Series A Preferred Stock converts to AAG Common Stock based upon the volume weighted average price of the shares of AAG Common Stock on the five trading days immediately preceding the conversion date, at a

3.5%

fixed discount, subject to a conversion price floor of

$10.875

per share and a conversion price cap of

$33.8080

per share, below or above which the conversion rate remains fixed. AAG Series A Preferred Stock embodies an unconditional obligation to transfer a variable number of shares based predominately on a fixed monetary amount known at inception, and, as such, it is not treated as equity of AAG, but rather as a liability until such time that it is converted to AAG Common Stock. Accordingly, American has reflected the amount of its claims satisfied through the issuance of the AAG Series A Preferred Stock as a liability included within the "Bankruptcy settlement obligations" line on American’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will reflect such obligations as a liability until such time where they are satisfied through the issuance of AAG Common Stock. Upon the satisfaction of these bankruptcy settlement obligations with AAG Common Stock, the Company will record an increase in additional paid-in capital through an intercompany equity transfer while derecognizing the related bankruptcy settlement obligation at that time. As of February 19, 2014, approximately

107 million

shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into an aggregate of

95 million

shares of AAG Common Stock.

The Single-Dip equity obligations, while outstanding, do not vote or participate in accordance with the terms of the Plan. These equity contract obligations, representing the amount of total Single-Dip unsecured creditor obligations not satisfied through the issuance of AAG Series A Preferred Stock at the Effective Date, represent an unconditional obligation to transfer a variable number of shares of AAG Common Stock based predominantly on a fixed monetary amount known at inception, and, as such, are not treated as equity, but rather as liabilities until the 120

th

day after emergence. At the 120

th

day after emergence, AAG will issue a variable amount of AAG Common Stock necessary to satisfy the obligation amount at emergence, plus accrued dividends of

12%

per annum, calculated daily, through the 120

th

day after emergence, based on the volume weighted average price of the shares of AAG Common Stock, at a

3.5%

discount, as specified in the Plan and subject to there being a sufficient number of shares remaining for issuance to unsecured creditors under the Plan.

In exchange for employees' contributions to the successful reorganization of AAG, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, AAG and American agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a fixed percentage of the distributions to be made to general unsecured claimholders. The fair value based on the expected number of shares to be distributed to satisfy this deemed claim was approximately

$1.7 billion

. On the Effective Date, AAG made an initial distribution of

$595 million

in common stock and American paid approximately

$300 million

in cash to cover payroll taxes related to the equity distribution. As of

December 31, 2013

, the remaining liability to certain American labor groups and employees of

$849 million

is based upon the estimated fair value of the shares of AAG Common Stock expected to be issued in satisfaction of such obligation, measured as if the obligation were settled using the trading price of AAG Common Stock at

December 31, 2013

. Increases in the trading price of AAG Common Stock after

December 31, 2013

, could cause a decrease in the fair value measurement of the remaining obligation, and vice-versa. American will record this obligation at fair value primarily through the 120

th

day after emergence, at which time the obligation will be materially settled.




. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


include the accounts of American. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Chapter 11 Matters

In accordance with GAAP, the Debtors applied ASC 852 "Reorganizations" (ASC 852), in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASC 852 requires that the financial statements, for periods subsequent to the Chapter 11 Cases, distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred in the Chapter 11 Cases are recorded in Reorganization Items, Net on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, pre-petition obligations that may be impacted by the Chapter 11 reorganization process as of December 31, 2012 were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Liabilities Subject to Compromise.

Certain of American's non-U.S. subsidiaries are not part of the Chapter 11 Cases. Since these non-US subsidiaries do not have significant transactions, American does not separately disclose the combined financial statements of such non-U.S. subsidiaries in accordance with the requirements of reorganization accounting.

In accordance with ASC 852, American did not meet the criteria for and will not adopt "fresh start" accounting as the reorganization value of American's assets, as determined based upon an estimate of the fair value of AMR's equity using the trading market price of US Airways Group, the amount of post-petition liabilities as of the Effective Date was significantly greater than the total pre-petition liabilities and expected allowed claims.

As a result, our assets and liabilities were not adjusted to fair value; but rather liabilities compromised by the Plan are stated at present values of amounts to be paid.



Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified between various financial statement line items to conform to the new AAG financial statement presentation. These reclassifications do not impact the historic net income and are comprised principally of the following items:

•

Reclassifications between various operating income line items to confirm the presentation of Cargo and Other revenues.

•

Reclassifications between various operating expense line items to conform the presentation of regional airline expenses.

•

Reclassifications between other nonoperating income (expense), net and operating expenses to conform the presentation of foreign currency gains and losses.

The following table summarizes the historical and revised financial statement amounts for American (in millions).

Additionally, the Company reclassified approximately

$292 million

from current to noncurrent liabilities as of December 31, 2012.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2013, American adopted revised guidance on the

Comprehensive Income

topic of the FASB Codification which requires an entity to present either parenthetically on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. The adoption did not have any impact on American’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Effective January 1, 2013, American adopted revised guidance on

Balance Sheet

topic of the FASB Codification, which clarifies the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The clarification applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and to certain securities borrowing and securities lending transactions, and not to ordinary trade receivables and payables. The adoption did not have any impact on the American’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Restricted and Short-term Investments

American has restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers' compensation obligations and funds held for certain tax obligations.

Aircraft fuel, spare parts, and supplies, net

Aircraft fuel, spare parts, and supplies, are recorded at net realizable value based on average costs. These items are expensed when used. An allowance for obsolescence is provided for aircraft spare parts and supplies.

Maintenance, Materials and Repairs

Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms when an obligation exists.

Other Intangibles, net

Intangible assets consist primarily of airport take-off and landing rights (Slots). Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets (route acquisition costs and international Slots) are tested for impairment annually on December 31, rather than amortized, or when a triggering event occurs, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Such triggering events may include significant changes to the Company's network or capacity, or the implementation of open skies agreements in countries where the Company operates flights.

As there is minimal market activity for the valuation of routes and international Slots, the Company measures fair value with inputs using the income approach. The income approach uses valuation techniques, such as future cash flows, to convert future amounts to a single present discounted amount. The inputs utilized for these valuations are unobservable and reflect the Company's assumptions about market participants and what they would use to value the routes and accordingly are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company's unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available as of

December 31, 2013

.

The following table provides information relating to the Company's amortized intangible assets as of

December 31, 2013

and


(in millions):



Airport operating and gate lease rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over


years to a

zero

residual value. The Dividend Miles customer relationships, marketing agreements and trademarks were identified as intangible assets subject to amortization and will be amortized over approximately

9 years

,

30 years

and

15 months

, respectively.

American recorded amortization expense related to these intangible assets of approximately

$18 million

,

$25 million

, and

$27 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, respectively. American expects to record annual amortization expense for the aforementioned definite-life intangible assets as follows (in millions):

The Company's indefinite-lived assets include certain international route authorities and domestic airport take-off and landing slots. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. As of

December 31, 2013

, and


, the Company had

$755 million

and

$708 million

, respectively, of indefinite-lived intangible assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Equipment and Property

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Interest expense related to the acquisition of certain property and equipment, including aircraft purchase deposits, is capitalized as an additional cost of the asset. Interest capitalized for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


was

$47 million

,

$50 million

and

$40 million

, respectively. Property and equipment is depreciated and amortized to residual values over the estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is less, using the straight-line method. Costs of major improvements that enhance the usefulness of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset or the modifications, whichever is less. The depreciable lives used for the principal depreciable asset classifications are:

Residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are generally

5%

to

10%

, except when guaranteed by a third-party for a different amount.

Equipment and property under capital leases are amortized over the term of the leases or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their expected useful lives. Lease terms vary but are generally


to


years for aircraft and

three

to


years for other leased equipment and property.

The Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset and the net book value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Passenger Revenue

Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors, including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized, including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on American's historical experience, and are recorded at the scheduled time of departure.



American purchases capacity, or ASMs, generated by the Company's wholly-owned regional air carriers and the capacity of Republic Airways Holdings' subsidiaries Republic Airlines (Republic) and Chautauqua Airlines (Chautauqua), and SkyWest Airlines, Inc.'s subsidiaries Sky West Airlines (SkyWest) and ExpressJet Airlines (ExpressJet) in certain markets. American's wholly-owned regional air carriers and Chautauqua, ExpressJet, Republic, and SkyWest operate regional aircraft in these markets as part of American Eagle carriers. American classifies revenues generated from transportation on these carriers as regional passenger revenues. Liabilities related to tickets sold by American for travel on these air carriers are also included in American's air traffic liability and are subsequently relieved in the same manner as described above

Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by American as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.

Frequent Flyer Programs

American currently operates the AAdvantage frequent flyer program. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American and oneworld carriers, as well as certain other partner airlines that participate in the programs. Mileage credits can also be earned through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in American's loyalty program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American, US Airways or other participating partner airlines, in which case American pays a fee.

American uses the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American or its regional affiliates. The Company has an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore has recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.

The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level required to redeem an award. Additionally, outstanding mileage credits are subject to expiration if unused. In calculating the liability, American estimates how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and excludes those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These estimates are based on historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the statement of operations as a part of passenger revenue.

The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. Incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food, and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. In addition, American also includes in the determination of incremental cost the amount of certain fees related to redemptions expected to be collected from AAdvantage members. These redemption fees reduce incremental cost. No profit or overhead margin is included in the accrual of incremental cost. These estimates are generally updated based upon our 12-month historical average of such costs.

As of

December 31, 2013

the liability for outstanding mileage credits for the AAdvantage program was

$580 million

and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within frequent flyer liability.

American also sells frequent flyer program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to business partners is comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. Historically, American has used the residual method of accounting to determine the values of each component as there had not been a material modification to any significant agreements since our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" on January 1, 2011.

During the fourth quarter, American and Citibank amended their current AAdvantage co-branded credit card agreement which resulted in a material modification of the terms of the arrangement. Therefore, subsequent to the amendment of the arrangement, American will apply the relative selling price method to determine the values of each deliverable. Under the relative selling price approach, American identified five revenue elements for the co-branded credit card agreements with Citibank: the transportation component; use of the American’s brand including access to frequent flyer member lists; advertising; lounge access; and baggage services (together excluding "the transportation component", the "marketing component").

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component



is deferred based on its relative selling price and amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel.

The marketing component represents services provided to American's business partners and relates primarily to the use of American’s logo and tradename along with access to customers lists of AAdvantage members. The marketing services are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale.

Upon application of the relative selling price method in the fourth quarter for American’s Citibank modification, American reduced its travel component liability and recorded Other Revenue of approximately

$31 million

. As a result of the change in the marketing component value when the relative selling price method is applied, American now defers less revenue per mile sold.

For American’s agreements where there has not been a material modification, it continues to apply the residual method.

As of

December 31, 2013

and


, American had

$1.2 billion

in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits (recorded as Frequent flyer liability on the consolidated balance sheets). For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, the marketing component of mileage sales recognized at the time of sale in other revenues was approximately

$816 million

,

$725 million

and

$761 million

, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, for the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

Selling Expenses

Selling expenses include commissions, credit card fees, computerized reservations systems fees and advertising. Advertising expenses are expensed on a straight-line basis as incurred throughout the year. Advertising expense was

$166 million

,

$153 million

and

$186 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, respectively.

Share-based Compensation

The Company accounts for its share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of grant, which is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock award. The fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market price of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant. See Note 11 for further discussion of share-based compensation.

Foreign Currency Gains and Losses

Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded as part of other nonoperating expense, net in American's consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency losses for


,


and


were

$55 million

,

$41 million

and

$17 million

, respectively.

Subsequent Events

In connection with preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and in accordance U.S. GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of

December 31, 2013

and identified items as set forth in Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements.




. Special Items, Net

The following table summarizes the components of American's Special items, net, as of

December 31, 2013

,


and


(in millions):

(1)

Consists primarily of impairment charges to write-down certain Boeing 757 aircraft and certain related long-lived assets to their estimated fair value in connection with reclassification of these assets to held for sale.

(2)

Consists primarily of charges resulting from a

$107 million

fair value adjustment to the pilot long-term disability plan and a

$43 million

charge to benefits expense due to a reorganization related increase in workers' compensation claims in the applicable period including adverse developments on older claims. Charges in 2012 are in connection with voluntary and involuntary employee separations from American and were paid through the end of 2013.

(3)

Employee related expenses consist of

$47 million

in severance to satisfy certain separation agreements resulting from the Merger and professional fees and

$56 million

related to equity awards granted in connection with the Merger, partially offset by the cancellation of equity awards in connection with the Merger.

(4)

Recognition of a

$67 million

gain on the sale of slots at LaGuardia and Ronald Regan Washington National Airport as part of the settlement reached with the Department of Justice.

See Note


to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for information on the Merger Agreement.


. Investments and Fair Value Measurements

Short-term investments consisted of (in millions):

Short-term investments at

December 31, 2013

, by contractual maturity included (in millions):



All short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

American utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. American's short-term investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities. American's fuel derivative contracts, which consist primarily of call options, collars (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold put option) and call spreads (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold call option), are valued using energy and commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs with quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves and volatilities. Heating oil, jet fuel and crude oil are the primary underlying commodities in the hedge portfolio. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

(1)

Unrealized gains or losses on short-term investments, restricted cash and short-term investments and derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at each measurement date.

(2)

American's short-term investments mature in one year or less except for

$250 million

of Bank notes/Certificates of deposit/Time deposits,

$511 million

of U.S. Government agency investments and

$2.1 billion

of Corporate obligations.

A

$56 million

Level 1 restricted money market security was liquidated in August 2013. The cash proceeds were subsequently reinvested in a Level 2 U.S. Treasury Obligation. American's policy regarding the recording of transfers between levels is to reflect any such transfers at the end of the reporting period.

As of

December 31, 2013

, American had no exposure to European sovereign debt.




. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

Aircraft Acquisition Commitments

American had total aircraft acquisition commitments as of

December 31, 2013

as follows:

As of

December 31, 2013

, payments for the above purchase commitments and certain engines, and future lease payments for all leased aircraft are presented in the table below (in millions):

(1)

These amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturers. American's purchase deposits totaled

$847 million

as of

December 31, 2013

. American has granted Boeing a security interest in American's purchase deposits with Boeing.

In February 2013, American entered into agreements with Boeing that provide for, among other things, the assumption and restructuring of certain existing aircraft purchase agreements, the entering into of a definitive purchase agreement with respect to Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, the confirmation of the purchase of the Boeing 787 aircraft (which previously had been subject to certain reconfirmation rights) and certain financing commitments. American also entered into an amendment to its agreement with Airbus S.A.S. in January 2013.

In December 2013, American entered into agreements with Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier) and Embraer S.A. (Embraer) under which it plans to acquire


Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft to be delivered in 2014 and 2015 and


Embraer E175 aircraft to be delivered between 2015 and 2017. The agreement also provides for the option to purchase up to


additional CRJ900 aircraft and


additional E175 aircraft.

Facility and support commitments

American has contracts related to facility construction or improvement projects, primarily at airport locations as well as information technology support. The contractual obligations related to these contracts are presented in the table below (in millions):



Capacity Purchase Agreements with Third-Party Regional Carriers

As of

December 31, 2013

, American's capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers had expiration dates ranging from


to


, with rights of American to extend the respective terms of each agreement. See Part I, Item 2. Properties for information on the aircraft contractually obligated to American under such capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers.

American has entered into agreements with the third-party regional carriers that operate certain of their aircraft using American's flight designator codes. American controls the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retains all revenues associated with revenue flights by those aircraft. American pays the third-party regional carriers an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, based on the airlines' costs of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. As of

December 31, 2013

, American's minimum fixed obligations under its capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers were as follows (approximately, in millions):

(1)

Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially.

Operating Leases

American leases certain aircraft, engines and ground equipment, in addition to the majority of its ground facilities and terminal space. As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company had


aircraft under operating leases, with remaining terms ranging from

one month

to approximately

14 years

. Airports are utilized for flight operations under lease arrangements with the municipalities or agencies owning or controlling such airports. Substantially all leases provide that the lessee must pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses applicable to the leased property. Some leases also include renewal and purchase options.

As of

December 31, 2013

, obligations under noncancellable operating leases for future minimum lease payments were as follows (in millions):

(1) As of

December 31, 2013

,

$298 million

is included on the accompanying balance sheet in Accrued liabilities and Deferred gains and credits, net relating to rent expense being recorded in advance of future operating lease payments.

Rent expense, excluding landing fees, was

$1.6 billion

,

$1.4 billion

and

$1.6 billion

in


,


and


, respectively.

Sale-leaseback Arrangements

During


, American financed


Boeing 737-800 and

three

777-300ER aircraft under sale-leaseback arrangements, which are accounted for as operating leases. Gains and losses associated with these sale-leaseback transactions are amortized over the respective remaining lease term and are included in the consolidated balance sheets as deferred gains and prepaid rent, respectively.

American has entered into sale-leaseback arrangements with certain leasing companies to finance


Boeing 737-800 scheduled to be delivered beginning in 2014. The financings of each aircraft under these arrangements are subject to certain terms and conditions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Aircraft

American has


owned aircraft and


leased aircraft which were financed with pass through trust certificates, or EETCs, issued by pass through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the



acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allowed American to raise the financing for several aircraft at one time and place such funds in escrow pending the purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.

Each trust covered a set amount of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced within a specific period of time. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the funds in escrow to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes were issued, at American's election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leased the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and in certain instances are guaranteed by AAG. As of

December 31, 2013

,

$3.5 billion

associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity and concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American to absorb decreases in value or entitles American to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American does not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Each lease does have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American to purchase the aircraft near the end of the lease term. However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircraft's fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American concluded it was not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American accounts for its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American's has no future obligations under these leveraged lease financing as of

December 31, 2013

.

Special Facility Revenue Bonds

American guarantees the payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment which is leased to American. Under such leases, American is required to make rental payments through


, sufficient to pay maturing principal and interest payments on the related bonds. To the extent these transactions were committed to prior to May 21, 1998, they are accounted for as operating leases. Approximately

$426 million

of the special facility revenue bonds are outstanding at

December 31, 2013

with total future payments of approximately

$619 million

as of

December 31, 2013

. Approximately

$112 million

of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the bonds in 2014. Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling accruals or are considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments.

Legal Proceedings

Chapter 11 Cases

. As previously disclosed, on the Petition Date, November 29, 2011, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order approving and confirming the Debtors' Plan. On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group, with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG. From the Petition Date through the Effective Date, pursuant to automatic stay provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and orders granted by the Bankruptcy Court, all actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors generally were stayed. Following the Effective Date, actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date, generally have been permanently enjoined. Any unresolved claims will continue to be subject to the claims reconciliation process under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court. However, certain pending litigation related to pre-petition liabilities may proceed in courts other than the Bankruptcy Court to the extent the parties to such litigation have obtained relief from the permanent injunction.

Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan has established a disputed claim reserve to hold shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and AAG Common Stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders that ultimately become allowed Single-Dip general unsecured claimholders after emergence. The shares provided for under the Plan are determined based upon



a disputed claim reserve amount of approximately

$755 million

. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of the remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to AAG but rather will be distributed by priority first, if necessary, to satisfy unsecured claims or labor-related obligations, and then to former AMR shareholders as of the Effective Date. AAG is not required to distribute additional shares above the

756 million

shares contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay all allowed unsecured claims. However, resolution of disputed claims could have a material effect on Single-Dip creditor recoveries under the Plan and the amount of additional share distributions, if any, that are made to former AMR shareholders as the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock that remain available for distribution upon resolution of disputed claims is limited pursuant to the Plan.

There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a determination that certain non-pension, post-employee benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be terminated without liability to American. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet ruled on this matter and we cannot predict whether American will receive relief from any of these obligations.

Government Antitrust Actions

. On August 13, 2013, the U.S. government, along with the States of Arizona, Florida, Tennessee and Texas, the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia (collectively, the plaintiff states), filed a complaint against US Airways Group and AMR in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the proposed Merger would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and sought to permanently enjoin the transaction. On September 5, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding the State of Michigan as a plaintiff. On October 1, 2013, the State of Texas entered into an agreement with US Airways Group and AMR that resolved that state’s objections to the Merger, and its claims were dismissed with prejudice on October 7, 2013. On November 11, 2013, US Airways and American entered into agreements with the U.S. government and the plaintiff states resolving all claims in the litigation. The agreement with the U.S. government requires the carriers to divest assets at certain airports and remains subject to public comment and court approval. In the agreement with the United States government, among other things, we agreed to divest and not reacquire for

ten years

certain rights and assets consisting of


Slot pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport, and


Slot pairs at LaGuardia, in each case together with and associated gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those Slot pairs, and

two

gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport. The agreement with the plaintiff states, which was entered by the court on November 12, 2013, requires our airlines, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, to maintain certain hub operations in a manner generally consistent with historical operations and to continue to provide scheduled daily service to certain specified communities, both for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from Washington Reagan National Airport

Merger Class Action

. On March 1, 2013, a complaint captioned Plumbers & Steamfitters Local Union No. 248 Pension Fund v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., No. CV2013-051605, was filed as a putative class action on behalf of the stockholders of US Airways Group in the Superior Court for Maricopa County, Arizona. On July 3, 2013, an amended complaint, captioned Dennis Palkon, et al. v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., No. CV2013-051605, was filed with the same court. The amended complaint names as defendants US Airways Group and the members of its board of directors, and alleges that the directors failed to maximize the value of US Airways Group in connection with the Merger and that US Airways Group aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duty. The relief sought in the amended complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or rescission in the event it has been consummated. The court in the above-referenced action denied the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order that had sought to enjoin the US Airways Group Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The above-referenced action was stayed pending the outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. government and various states on August 13, 2013 (described above). This stay has now been lifted and a motion to dismiss this action filed by US Airways Group is pending before the court. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.

Private Party Antitrust Action

. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint names as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, and alleges that the effect of the Merger may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. The relief sought in the complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants, and on October 2, 2013, dismissed the initial California action. The Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On January 10, 2014, the Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add a claim for money damages and to request injunctive relief requiring the carriers to hold separate their assets. Trial is set for June 2014. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.



General

. The Company and its subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within the control of the Company. Therefore, although the Company will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on the Company are uncertain.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

The Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. The Company is not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs.

In its aircraft financing agreements, American generally indemnifies the financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other relevant parties against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the negligence of the indemnified parties.

American's loan agreements and other London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate American to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii) any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy requirements. In addition, American's loan agreements, derivative contracts and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax provision that requires American to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law.

These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts American could be obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle the lender to foreclose on the collateral to realize the amount due.

In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans and derivative transactions, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, American may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant transaction.

American has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real estate leases where American as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities related to American's use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, American provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to American's use of the leased property.

Under certain contracts with third parties, American indemnifies the third-party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third-party, or certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. American has liability insurance protecting American for some of the obligations it has undertaken under these indemnities.

American is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its operations. American is also subject to regulatory assessments in the ordinary course of business. American establishes reserves for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from these regulatory matters, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on American's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, after consideration of available insurance.

Venezuela Cash and Short-term Investments

The business environment in Venezuela has been challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluation, high inflation and governmental restrictions, including currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

$710 million

of our unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars, valued at a weighted average rate of

6.04

bolivars to the dollar. The period of time to exchange those funds into dollars and repatriate them has been increasing and is presently more than a



year. On January 23, 2014, the Venezuelan government issued a regulation to implement a new system for determining the exchange rate based on the result of limited periodic sales of dollars known as Sicad auctions (currently

11.80

to the dollar based on the February 21, 2014 Sicad auction) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of conversion and repatriation of local currency. The government also enacted a new law effective February 19, 2014 that authorizes additional methods of exchanging Venezuelan bolivars at rates other than the controlled base rate of 6.3 to the dollar or the existing Sicad auction rate, but the regulations necessary to implement the law are still pending and it is not clear at this point whether or how the new methods may impact the pending balances of Venezuelan bolivars held by airlines. We are working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. Further, the current, devalued rates may have an ongoing adverse effect on our reported results if we are unable to fully adjust prices on flights to and from Venezuela, of which there can be no assurance. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors "

We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control."

Other

In 2010, American and Japan Airlines entered into a JBA under which, amongst other things, American provided Japan Airlines a guarantee of certain minimum incremental revenue resulting from the successful operation of the joint business for the first three years following its implementation, subject to certain terms and conditions. As of

December 31, 2013

, American reached an agreement with JAL to settle the liability at an amount already recorded.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, American entered into a settlement agreement resolving a commercial dispute. The settlement agreement includes two elements which were valued at relative fair value and will be recognized when earned. American determined that the settlement includes a litigation gain of

$280 million

, which was valued using future cash flows and recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012. The settlement also includes an incentive which is contingent upon signing a future contract and will be recognized over the term of the future contract. The contract was signed in January, 2014.

As a result of the Terrorist Attacks and the subsequent liability protections provided for by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act), the Company recorded a liability for the Terrorist Attacks claims equal to the related insurance receivable due to American. The Stabilization Act provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims, whether compensatory or punitive, arising from the Terrorist Attacks, against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability coverage maintained by the air carrier. As of

December 31, 2013

, the remaining liability and the amount of the offsetting receivable were each

$1.0 billion

.

At

December 31, 2013

, the Company was operating


jet aircraft under capital leases. Leases can generally be renewed at rates based on fair market value at the end of the lease term for a number of additional years.

As of

December 31, 2013

, AAG had issued guarantees covering approximately

$1.3 billion

of American's tax-exempt bond debt (and interest thereon) and

$4.7 billion

of American's secured debt (and interest thereon).

In connection with the Merger and pursuant to the Plan on December 9, 2013, (i) American entered into a joinder to loan agreement and became an obligor of US Airways Group's

$1.6 billion

2013 Citicorp credit facilities and (ii) American entered into a second supplemental indenture that guaranteed the payment obligations associated with the US Airways Group's

6.125%

Notes, due in 2018.

2013-1 EETCs

On March 12, 2013, American closed its private offering of

two

tranches of enhanced equipment trust certificates (the Series 2013-1A/B EETCs) in the aggregate face amount of

$664 million

. The Series 2013-1A/B EETCs are comprised of a



senior tranche of Class A Certificates with an interest rate of

4.00%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of July 15, 2025, and a junior tranche of Class B Certificates with an interest rate of

5.625%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of January 15, 2021. The Series 2013-1A/B EETCs represent an interest in the assets of two separate pass through trusts, each of which hold equipment notes issued by American. Interest on the issued and outstanding equipment notes will be payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2013, and principal on such equipment notes is scheduled for payment on January 15 and July 15 of certain years, commencing on January 15, 2014. As of

December 31, 2013

, the equipment notes are secured by

eight

currently owned Boeing 737-823 aircraft,

one

currently owned Boeing 777-223ER aircraft, and

four

currently owned Boeing 777-323ER aircraft. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act).

On June 5, 2013, American closed its private offering of Class C enhanced equipment trust certificates (the Series 2013-1C EETCs) in the aggregate face amount of

$120 million

. The Series 2013-1C EETCs rank junior to the Series 2013-1A/B EETCs. The Series 2013-1C EETCs were issued with an interest rate of

6.125%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of July 15, 2018. The 2013-1C EETCs represent an interest in the assets of a separate pass through trust, which will hold certain equipment notes issued by American. The Series 2013-1C EETCs are secured by the same aircraft securing the Series 2013-1A/B EETCs. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

2013-2 EETCs

American filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court on October 9, 2012, requesting entry of an order authorizing American to, among other things: (i) obtain post-petition financing in an amount of up to

$1.5 billion

secured on a first priority basis by, among other things, up to


Boeing 737-823 aircraft,


Boeing 757-223 aircraft,

one

Boeing 767-323ER aircraft and


Boeing 777-223ER aircraft as part of a new enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) financing (the Refinancing EETC) to be offered pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (ii) use cash on hand (including proceeds of the Refinancing EETC) to indefeasibly repay the existing pre-petition obligations secured by such aircraft, as applicable, which are currently financed through, as the case may be, an EETC financing entered into by American in July 2009 (the Series 2009-1 Pass Through Certificates), a secured notes financing entered into by American in July 2009 (the 2009-2 Senior Secured Notes) and an EETC financing entered into by American in October 2011 (the Series 2011-2 Pass Through Certificates and, together with the Series 2009-1 Pass Through Certificates and the 2009-2 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Financings), in each case without the payment of any make-whole amount or other premium or prepayment penalty.

The Bankruptcy Court approved the motion on January 17, 2013 and entered an order (the EETC Order) to such effect on February 1, 2013. The trustees for the Existing Financings appealed the EETC Order and judgments rendered in certain related adversary proceedings. The appeals (the Appeals) were briefed and oral argument before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Second Circuit) was heard on June 20, 2013. On September 12, 2013, the Second Circuit fully affirmed the Company's right to repay the Existing Financings without the payment of any make-whole amount or other premium or prepayment penalty. On September 26, 2013, the trustees for the Existing Financings filed a petition for an en banc rehearing of the Appeals by the Second Circuit. On November 18, 2013, the Second Circuit denied such request for rehearing. On February 12, 2014, the trustees for the Existing Financings filed a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court. American intends to continue to assert vigorously its right to repay the Existing Financings without the payment of any make-whole amounts or other premium or prepayment penalty.

On July 31, 2013, American closed its private offering of the Refinancing EETC (the Series 2013-2A EETC) in the aggregate face amount of

$1.4 billion

with an interest rate of

4.95%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of January 15, 2023. In September 2013, American repaid the Existing Financings, including securities tendered to the Company under a tender offer for the Existing Financings that commenced on June 27, 2013, and received the proceeds from the Series 2013-2A EETC. In conjunction with the repayment of the Existing Financings, American incurred cash charges of

$19 million

, included in Interest expense, net of capitalized interest and a charge of

$54 million

, included in Miscellaneous, net, of which

$21 million

is cash, related to the premium on tender for the Existing Financings, and

$33 million

is non-cash, related to the write-off of unamortized issuance costs. The 2013-2A EETC represents an interest in the assets of a separate pass through trust, which will hold certain equipment notes issued by American. The Series 2013-2A EETC is secured by the same aircraft previously used to secure the Existing Financings. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

On November 27, 2013, American closed its private offering of Class B enhanced equipment trust certificates (the Series 2013-2B EETCs) in the aggregate face amount of

$512 million

. The Series 2013-2B EETCs rank junior to the Series 2013-2A EETCs. The Series 2013-2B EETCs were issued with an interest rate of

5.60%

per annum and a final expected



distribution date of July 15, 2020. The 2013-2C EETCs represent an interest in the assets of a separate pass through trust, which will hold certain equipment notes issued by American. The Series 2013-2B EETCs are secured by the same aircraft securing the Series 2013-2A EETCs. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

On December 20, 2013, American closed its private offering of Class C enhanced equipment trust certificates (the Series 2013-2C EETCs) in the aggregate face amount of

$256 million

. The Series 2013-2C EETCs generally rank junior to the Series 2013-2A and 2B EETCs. The Series 2013-2C EETCs were issued with an interest rate of

6.00%

per annum and a final expected distribution date of January 15, 2017. The 2013-2C EETCs represent an interest in the assets of a separate pass through trust, which will hold certain equipment notes issued by American. The Series 2013-2C EETCs are secured by the same aircraft securing the Series 2013-2A and 2B EETCs. The certificates were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

Credit Facilities

On June 27, 2013, American and AAG entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with certain lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a

$1.9 billion

term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) and a

$1.0 billion

revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities). As of

December 31, 2013

, American had borrowed

$1.9 billion

under the Term Loan Facility. The Credit Facilities are secured obligations of American and guaranteed by AAG. The Revolving Facility provides that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder and have letters of credit issued thereunder in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of up to

$1.0 billion

. As of

December 31, 2013

, there were

no

borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

Upon consummation of the Merger, US Airways Group and US Airways joined the Credit Facilities as guarantors. Following the joinder, certain minimum dollar-thresholds under the negative and financial covenants in the Credit Facilities were automatically increased. The Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility mature on June 27, 2019 and June 27, 2018, respectively, unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties. The Term Loan Facility is repayable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to

0.25%

of the original principal amount thereof with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility.

Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time, with a premium of

1.00%

applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following December 27, 2013. Mandatory prepayments at par of term loans and revolving loans are required to the extent necessary to comply with American's covenants regarding the collateral coverage ratio and certain dispositions of collateral. In addition, if a "change of control" (as defined in the Credit Agreement) occurs, American will, absent an amendment or waiver, be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities and terminate the Revolving Facility.

The Credit Facilities bear interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at American's option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of

0.75%

with respect to the Term Loan) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin  is

3.00%

for borrowings under both the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Credit Facilities are secured by certain collateral, including liens on certain route authorities to operate between certain specified cities, certain take-off and landing rights at certain airports and American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities as more fully described below in "Collateral Related Covenants".

The Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross-acceleration to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Credit Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. The Credit Facilities also include affirmative, negative, and financial covenants that, among other things, require AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than

$2.0 billion

and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries, including American, to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.

Senior Secured Notes

In March 2011, American issued

$1.0 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2016 (the Senior Secured Notes) guaranteed on an unsecured basis by AAG. In connection with the closing of the Merger, US Airways and US Airways Group entered into a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 9, 2013, pursuant to which US Airways and



US Airways Group became guarantors. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of

7.50%

per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2011. As is customary for financings of this nature, the indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of events of default under the related indenture. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes are secured by certain route authorities, airport landing and takeoff slots, and rights to use or occupy space in airport terminals, in each case that American uses to operate non-stop services between certain airports and American is required maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding amounts under the Senior Secured Notes as more fully described above in "Collateral Related Covenants."

American, at its option, may redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2013, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time prior to March 15, 2013, American, at its option, may redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to

100%

of their principal amount plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time prior to March 15, 2014, American, at its option, may redeem (1) up to

35%

of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of

107.5%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and (2) during any 12-month period, up to

10%

of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of

103%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If American sells certain assets or if a "change of control" (as defined in the indenture) occurs, American must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at prices specified in the indenture.

The indenture for the Senior Secured Notes includes covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends. The indenture for the Senior Secured Notes also contains events of default customary for similar financings, including cross-default to certain material indebtedness of American. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated and become due and payable.

Other Financing Transactions

In June 2013, American also remarketed approximately

$216 million

of Tulsa Municipal Airport Revenue Refunding Bonds Trust Series 2000B, 2001A, and 2001B due June 1, 2035 (Series 2000B) and December 1, 2035 (Series 2001 A&B).

Citibank Advanced Purchase Agreement

In


, American entered into an arrangement under which Citibank paid to American

$1.0 billion

in order to pre-purchase AAdvantage Miles (the Pre-Purchase Miles) under American's AAdvantage frequent flier loyalty program (the Pre-Purchase). Approximately

$890 million

of the Pre-Purchase proceeds was accounted for as a loan from Citibank with the remaining

$110 million

recorded as Deferred Revenue in Other liabilities and deferred credits.

To effect the Pre-Purchase, American and Citibank entered into an Amended and Restated AAdvantage Participation Agreement (as so amended and restated, the Amended Participation Agreement). Under the Amended Participation Agreement, American agreed that it would apply in equal monthly installments, over a five year period beginning on January 1, 2012, the Pre-Purchase Miles to Citibank cardholders' AAdvantage accounts.

Pursuant to the Pre-Purchase, Citibank has been granted a first-priority lien on certain of American's AAdvantage program assets. Commencing on December 31, 2011, American has the right to repay in cash, without premium or penalty, any or all of the amounts owed to Citibank that have not already been satisfied by the award of Pre-Purchase Miles to Citibank cardholders' accounts. American is also obligated, in certain circumstances (including certain specified termination events under the Amended Participation Agreement, certain cross defaults and cross acceleration events, and if any Pre-Purchase Miles remain at the end of the term) to repay in cash all outstanding amounts owed Citibank.

The Amended Participation Agreement includes provisions that grant Citibank the right to use Pre-Purchase Miles on an accelerated basis under specified circumstances.



Collateral Related Covenants

Certain of American's debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require American to periodically appraise the collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, American is required, as applicable, to subject additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part, with premium (if any), or pay additional interest on the related indebtedness, as described below.

Specifically, American is required to meet certain collateral coverage tests on a periodic basis on

two

financing transactions: (1) the Senior Secured Notes and (2) Credit Facilities, as described below:

At

December 31, 2013

, American was in compliance with the most recently completed collateral coverage tests for the Senior Secured Notes and Credit Facilities.

Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were

$706 million

,

$498 million

and

$628 million

for

and


, respectively.


. Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Fuel Price Risk Management

As of

December 31, 2013

, American had fuel derivative contracts outstanding covering

22 million

barrels of jet fuel that will be settled over the next

eighteen

months. American does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. American has not entered into any fuel hedges since the Effective Date and our current policy is not to do so.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, American assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. Derivatives that meet the requirements are granted special hedge accounting treatment, and American’s hedges generally meet these requirements. Accordingly, American’s fuel derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, and the fair value of American’s hedging contracts is recorded in Current Assets or Current Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the underlying jet fuel is purchased. American determines the ineffective portion of its fuel hedge contracts by comparing the cumulative change in the total value of the fuel hedge contract, or group of fuel hedge contracts, to the cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel hedge. If the total cumulative change in value of the fuel hedge contract more than offsets the total cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel hedge, the difference is considered ineffective and is immediately recognized as a component of Aircraft fuel expense. Effective gains or losses on fuel hedging contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings as a component of Aircraft fuel expense when the underlying jet fuel being hedged is used.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related commodities. American assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. In doing so, American



uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g., NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel. American also monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges’ market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be "highly effective" if the R-squared is greater than

80%

and the dollar offset correlation is within

80%

to

125%

. American discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to discontinue the hedging relationship. Subsequently, any changes in the fair value of these derivatives are marked to market through earnings in the period of change.

For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, American recognized net gains/(losses) of approximately

$(12) million

,

$4 million

and

$301 million

, respectively, as a component of Aircraft fuel expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to its fuel hedging agreements, including the ineffective portion of the hedges. The net fair value of American’s fuel hedging agreements at

December 31, 2013

and


, representing the amount American would receive upon termination of the agreements (net of settled contract assets), totaled

$107 million

and

$62 million

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2013

, American estimates that during the next

twelve months

it will reclassify from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings approximately

$45 million

in net

gains

(based on prices as of

December 31, 2013

) related to its fuel derivative hedges.

The impact of aircraft fuel derivative instruments (all cash flow hedges) on American's Consolidated Statements of Operations is depicted below (in millions):

(1)    Includes the effective portion of hedge gain (loss)

(2)    Includes the ineffective portion of hedge gain (loss)

(3)    Includes the effective and ineffective portion of hedge gain (loss)

The impact of aircraft fuel derivative instruments (all cash flow hedges) on American's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income is depicted below (in millions):

(1)    Includes the effective portion of hedge gain (loss)



While certain of American's fuel derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting agreements with its counterparties, American does not offset its fuel derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain of these agreements would also allow for the offsetting of fuel derivatives with interest rate derivatives. The impact of aircraft fuel derivative instruments (all cash flow hedges) on American's Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the impact of offsetting aircraft fuel derivative instruments, is depicted below (in millions):

(1)

Fuel derivative assets are included in Fuel derivative contracts on American's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2)

Fuel derivative liabilities are included in Accrued liabilities on American's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(3)

As of

December 31, 2013

, American had posted cash collateral of an immaterial amount.

American is also exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these financial instruments, and although no assurances can be given, American does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date, reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. To manage credit risks, American selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. American also maintains industry-standard security agreements with a number of its counterparties which may require American or the counterparty to post collateral if the value of selected instruments exceeds specified mark-to-market thresholds or upon certain changes in credit ratings. The amount of collateral required to be posted from time to time may be substantial.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of American’s long-term debt classified as Level 2 were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analyses, based on American's current estimated incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. All of American’s long term debt not classified as subject to compromise is classified as Level 2.

The carrying value and estimated fair values of American’s long-term debt, including current maturities, not classified as subject to compromise, were (in millions):



The carrying value and estimated fair value of American’s long-term debt, including current maturities, classified as subject to compromise, were (in millions):

All of American's long term debt classified as subject to compromise as of

December 31, 2012

is classified as Level 2.

American is also party to certain interest rate swap agreements that are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Ineffectiveness for these instruments is required to be measured at each reporting period. The ineffectiveness and fair value associated with all of American's interest rate cash flow hedges for all periods presented was not material.


. Income Taxes

The significant components of the income tax provision (benefit) were (in millions):

The income tax expense (benefit) differed from amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate as follows (in millions):

American recorded a net income tax benefit of

$354 million

which is composed of a

$538 million

non-cash income tax benefit, a

$214 million

tax charge for additional valuation allowance, and a

$30 million

income tax credit. American recorded a

$538 million

non-cash income tax benefit from continuing operations during the fourth quarter of 2013. Under current accounting rules, American is required to consider all items (including items recorded in other comprehensive income) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, American recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the year, which will be exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholder's equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations for this item, American's year-end net deferred tax position is not impacted by this tax allocation. American recorded similar amounts when reporting other



comprehensive income in 2009 and 2012. The resulting residual income tax expense will remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until all amounts in AOCI that relate to the plan or program that gave rise to the residual income taxes are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. American will reclassify to earnings all residual tax amounts relating to our Pension and Retiree Medical Liability (specifically relating to Pension and OPEB activity) and Derivative Financial Instruments (specifically relating to Fuel Hedging Contracts activity) in the period in which there are no longer any amounts in AOCI associated with those plans or programs. American anticipates recognizing a non-cash income tax expense of

$313 million

in continuing operations during


upon the settlement of the currently outstanding Fuel Hedging Contract arrangements.

American provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax assets, will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (primarily reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible. The assessment of realization of deferred tax assets considers those tax planning strategies that management believes to be prudent and feasible strategies American would implement, if necessary, to prevent a tax attribute from expiring. During the fourth quarter of 2013, American recorded a

$214 million

tax charge attributable to additional valuation allowance required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.

A portion of change in the valuation allowance reflects the recording by American in


,


and


of an income tax expense (credit) of approximately

$(30) million

,

$0 million

and

$(25) million

, respectively, resulting from American’s elections under applicable sections of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012), allowing corporations to accelerate utilization of certain research and alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.

In addition to the changes in the valuation allowance from operations described in the table above, the valuation allowance was also impacted by the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), described in Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements. The total increase in the valuation allowance was

$155 million

,

$282 million

, and

$1.1 billion

in


,


and


, respectively.

The components of American's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):

At

December 31, 2013

, American had available for federal income tax purposes an AMT credit carryforward of approximately

$467 million

, which is available for an indefinite period, and federal net operating losses of approximately

$9.5



billion

for regular tax purposes, which will expire, if unused, beginning in


. These net operating losses include an unrealized benefit of approximately

$647 million

related to the implementation of share-based compensation accounting guidance that will be recorded in equity when realized. American had available for state income tax purposes net operating losses of

$3.8 billion

, which expire, if unused, in years


through


. The amount that will expire in


is

$96 million

if not used.

American files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. American’s 2004 through


tax years are still subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination and American is under examination, in administrative appeals, or engaged in tax litigation in certain jurisdictions. American believes that the effect of any additional assessment(s) will be immaterial to its consolidated financial statements.

Cash payments (refunds) for income taxes were

$7 million

,

$5 million

and

$(0.5) million

for


,


and


, respectively.

Under special tax rules (the Section 382 Limitation), cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceeding 50% during a rolling 3-year period can potentially limit a company’s future use of net operating losses and tax credits. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "

Chapter 11 Reorganization Risks regarding the potential impact of these rules on American’s utilization of its net operating losses

."

American has an unrecognized tax benefit of approximately

$5 million

, which did not change during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Changes in the unrecognized tax benefit have no impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. Accrued interest on tax positions is recorded as a component of interest expense but was not significant at December 31, 2013.

The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefit are (in millions):

American estimates that the unrecognized tax benefit will not significantly change within the next twelve months.


. Share Based Compensation

In December 2013, the Board of Directors of AAG approved the 2013 AAG Incentive Award Plan (the 2013 Plan). Awards may be in the form of an option, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award, performance award, dividend equivalent award, deferred stock award, deferred stock unit award, stock payment award or stock appreciation right. The 2013 Plan authorizes the grant of awards for the issuance of

40 million

shares plus any shares underlying awards granted under the 2013 Plan, or any pre-existing US Airways Group plan, that are forfeited, terminate or are cash settled (in whole or in part) without a payment being made in the form of shares. In addition, any shares that are available for issuance under the US Airways Group 2011 Incentive Award Plan (the 2011 Plan) as of the effective date of the Merger may be used for awards under the 2013 Plan; provided, that awards using such available shares under the 2011 Plan shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under 2011 Plan and shall only be made to individuals who were not providing services to AAG prior to the Merger. Award granted under the 2013 Plan upon the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, will not reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2013 Plan.

In addition, pursuant to the Plan, and as approved by the Bankruptcy Court,

certain officers, directors and employees received share-based incentive awards, Alignment and Equity Incentive, related to the Merger and future service. Awards issued in conjunction with the Plan are discussed in more detail below.

In


, share-based compensation expense of

$37 million

, related to the Merger, was recorded under Special items, net and

$28 million

was recorded under Salaries, wages and benefits. In


and


the total charge for share-based compensation expense, included in Salaries, wages, and benefits expense, was

$26 million

and

$35 million

, respectively.

Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Awards

As of

December 31, 2013

, American has outstanding restricted stock unit awards with service conditions (time vested) and performance conditions. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the underlying



shares of common stock on the date of grant. For time vested awards, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award. For awards with performance conditions, the expense is recognized based on the expected achievement at each reporting period. Stock-settled restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) are classified as equity awards as the vesting results in the issuance of shares of AAG Common Stock. Cash-settled restricted stock unit awards (CRSUs) are classified as liability awards as the vesting results in payment of cash by American.

Alignment Awards

On December 9, 2013, Alignment awards were granted in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and are expected to be settled in AAG Common Stock subject to potential NOL restrictions. The awards were provided to legacy AMR employees in order to align interests and create parity with peers at US Airways and one-third of the awards vested on the Company's emergence from bankruptcy. The remaining awards vest equally on the one and two year anniversary of emergence. Employees terminated in connection with the Merger fully vest in their awards on the termination date. Compensation expenses recorded in connection with these awards have been and will be charged to Merger related expenses.

Activity during


for the alignment awards is presented below:

As of

December 31, 2013

, there was

$43 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the alignment awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.9

years. The total fair value of awards settled during the year ended

December 31, 2013

was

$28 million

.

Equity Incentive Awards

Equity incentive awards granted Pursuant to the Plan have a vesting commencement date of April 10, 2013 and were granted in the form of RSUs that are expected to be settled in AAG Common Stock subject to potential NOL restrictions. Payment dates are April 2014, April 2015 and April 2016 with pro-rata vesting based on the number of days served from April 10, 2013. Related expense has been and will be charged to Salaries, Wages and benefits.

Activity during


for equity incentive awards is presented below:

The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of equity incentive share awards granted during


was

$24.60

. As of

December 31, 2013

, there was

$41 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to equity incentive share awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.6

years.



Merger Equity Grant

The Merger Equity Grant was granted on the Effective Date to certain officers and directors and employees in the form of RSUs and will be settled in equity for domestic employees and in cash for international employees. Each restricted stock unit award granted under the program will vest, subject to the executive’s continued employment, with respect to (i) 50% of the restricted stock units on December 16, 2015; (ii) 25% of the restricted stock units on the earlier to occur of (a) December 16, 2015, if the Company is issued a Single Operating Certificate prior to or on that date or (b) the date on which the Company is issued a Single Operating Certificate, provided that such date is prior to or on December 9, 2016; and (iii) 25% of the restricted stock units on the date the board of directors or compensation committee of the board of directors determines that the Company has achieved at least $1 billion in net synergies with respect to fiscal year 2015 or 2016. Compensation expenses recorded in connection with these awards have been and will be charged to Merger related expenses.

As of

December 31, 2013

, there was

$184 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.9

years.

Cash-settled restricted stock

CRSU award activity for all plans is as follows (shares in thousands):

As of

December 31, 2013

, the liability related to CRSUs was less than a million and will continue to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting date until all awards are vested. As of

December 31, 2013

, the total unrecognized compensation expense for CRSUs was

$7 million

and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.9 years

.

Prior to the Petition Date, American adopted certain plans which provided for the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and other share-based awards. American granted stock compensation under three plans: the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 1998 Plan), the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the 2003 Plan) and the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). Collectively, the 1998 Plan and the 2009 Plan are referred to as the LTIP Plans. No awards were made under American's plans in 2012 or 2013. American had share-based incentive awards including stock options/stock appreciation rights granted under the LTIP Plans and the 2003 Plan, performance share awards granted under the LTIP plans and based upon a requisite service period and contingently issuable based upon the AMR's relative stock price performance compared to certain of its competitors over a three year period, deferred share awards granted under the LTIP plans and based solely on a requisite service period and career equity awards granted to certain employees of the Company vesting upon the retirement of those individuals. Deferred share and career equity awards totaling

5,899,500

shares vested in AMR common stock pursuant to the Plan. These plan participants become holders of interest in AMR Corporation and will receive distributions of AAG common stock in accordance with the Plan (See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Plan). All remaining outstanding awards were canceled in accordance with the Plan upon emergence from Chapter 11.



Activity of all previous AMR awards is as follows:


. Retirement Benefits

American sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for eligible employees. The defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. American uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its defined benefit plans. In addition, American provides certain postemployment benefits to its employees. These benefits include disability-related and workers’ compensation benefits for certain employees. American accrues for the cost of such benefit expenses once an appropriate triggering event has occurred.

As of

December 31, 2013

, American’s estimate of the long-term rate of return on plan assets was

8.00%

based on the target asset allocation. Expected returns on longer duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are based on a combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and expected value to be generated through active management, currency overlay and securities lending programs. American’s annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets as of

December 31, 2013

, was approximately

8.93%

.

The objectives of American’s investment policies are to: maintain sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement benefits; produce a long-term rate of return that meets or exceeds the assumed rate of return for plan assets; limit the volatility of asset performance and funded status; and diversify assets among asset classes and investment managers.



Based on these investment objectives, a long-term strategic asset allocation has been established. This strategic allocation seeks to balance the potential benefit of improving funded position with the potential risk that the funded position would decline. The current strategic target asset allocation is as follows:

Each asset class is actively managed and, historically, the plans’ assets have produced returns, net of management fees, in excess of the expected rate of return over the last ten years. Public equity and emerging market fixed income securities are used to provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the long-term than longer duration U.S. bonds. Public stocks are managed using a value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. Longer duration U.S. bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. Additionally, the Company engages currency overlay managers in an attempt to increase returns by protecting non-U.S. dollar denominated assets from a rise in the relative value of the U.S. dollar. American also participates in securities lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis. These programs are subject to market risk.

Investments in securities traded on recognized securities exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the last bid price. The money market fund is valued at fair value which represents the net asset value of the shares of such fund as of the close of business at the end of the period. Investments in limited partnerships are carried at estimated net asset value as determined by and reported by the general partners of the partnerships and represent the proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships. Common/collective trusts are valued at net asset value based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the trusts as determined by the sponsor of the trusts. The 103-12 investment trust is valued at net asset value which is determined by the issuer at the end of each month and is based on the aggregate fair value of trust assets less liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the period.

American is required to make minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of ERISA, the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Pension Relief Act of 2010, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century Act of 2012. In 2013 American contributed

$489 million

to its defined benefit pension plans, which covered minimum contributions for periods prior to the American’s Chapter 11 filing and periods thereafter (see Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), as well as certain interest and penalty interest due with respect to contributions for pre-petition periods. On

January 15, 2014

, American contributed an additional

$34 million

to its defined benefit pension plans representing the final quarterly contribution for the 2013 plan year.

American's minimum required contribution to its pension plans for


is

$120 million

. Currently, American's minimum funding obligation for its pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Upon expiration of these rules, American's funding obligations are likely to increase materially.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid (in millions):

Modifications to Retirement and Life Insurance Benefits

Effective November 1, 2012, American's defined benefit pension plans were frozen and eligible employees began to receive a replacement benefit under the $uper $aver 401(k) Plan. American matches employee contributions up to

5.5%

of eligible earnings and, with the ratification of a new CBA by pilots on December 7, 2012, pilots receive contributions of

14%

under the same plan.

In December 2012, the Pilot A Plan, a defined benefit plan, was amended to remove the lump-sum option and the installment option forms of benefit effective December 31, 2012. A small group of American pilots is appealing the Bankruptcy Court's decision authorizing American to eliminate the lump sum option and installment option forms of benefit. This is the same group of pilots that is appealing the Bankruptcy Court's decisions authorizing American to reject the pilot CBA and approve the new pilot CBA. All of these appeals have been consolidated, and are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

The Pilot B Plan, a defined contribution plan, was terminated on November 30, 2012. With the exception of a small residual balance to cover final plan expenses, American expects all remaining funds, which represent a small group of uncashed distribution checks, to be distributed by the end of second quarter 2014.

On July 6, 2012, American commenced an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court seeking a determination on the issue of vesting for former employees who retired before November 1, 2012 and were eligible for certain retiree medical coverage. The Court held a hearing on January 23, 2013 and has not ruled on this matter as of the date of this report. The Company



has been negotiating with the retiree committee since July 2012, seeking a consensual agreement to terminate subsidized retiree medical coverage and life insurance coverage.

As a result of the modifications to the retirement benefits as discussed above, a portion of the pension and postretirement benefits liability, primarily relating to retiree medical and other benefits, was classified as liabilities subject to compromise as of December 31, 2012. This amount was reinstated upon emergence since there was no resolution in the Chapter 11 Cases. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements for the breakout of liabilities subject to compromise, including that related to pension and postretirement benefits.

Curtailment and Plan Amendment in the Third Quarter of 2012

In accordance with ASC 715 "Retirement Benefits" (ASC 715), in the third quarter of 2012, American remeasured its defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a result of modifications to its retirement plans and reductions in certain work groups (see above and Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements). American updated its significant actuarial assumptions used for the remeasurements including the discount rate, which was lowered to

4.10%

and

3.80%

for the defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical plans, respectively.

The remeasurement of the defined benefit plans resulted in an actuarial loss of

$1.9 billion

offset by a curtailment gain of

$1.8 billion

. In addition, a loss of

$58 million

, representing unamortized prior service cost as of the remeasurement date of the frozen defined benefit plans, is included as a component of reorganization items, net.

Further, as a result of modifications to its retiree medical plans, American recognized a negative plan amendment of

$1.9 billion

, which is included as a component of actuarial gain arising in current year in other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the future service life of the active plan participants for whom the benefit was eliminated, or approximately

eight

years. In addition, a net credit of

$124 million

, representing unamortized prior service credits of

$157 million

offset by a curtailment loss of

$33 million

, is included as a component of reorganization items, net.


. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows (in millions):

As of

December 31, 2013

, American estimates that during the next twelve months it will reclassify from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) into earnings approximately

$45 million

in net gains (based on prices as of

December 31, 2013

) related to its fuel derivative hedges.



Reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


are as follows (in millions):

American recognized a

$538 million

non-cash income tax benefit, offset by a

$538 million

charge to other comprehensive income, during the fourth quarter of 2013 related to gains in other comprehensive income. Also, American recognized a

$569 million

non-cash income tax benefit, offset by a

$569 million

charge to other comprehensive income, during the fourth quarter of 2012 related to gains in other comprehensive income. See Note


to American's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Amounts allocated to other comprehensive income for income taxes as further described in Note


will remain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) until American ceases all related activities, such as termination of the pension plan.


. Segment Reporting

American’s operations of American and AMR Eagle are treated as an integrated route network and the route scheduling system maximizes the operating results of American. American’s chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions to maximize American’s consolidated financial results. Based on the way American treats the network and the manner in which resource allocation decisions are made, American has only one operating segment for financial reporting purposes consisting of the operations of American and AMR Eagle.

These amounts are classified as Payable to affiliate on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement between American and the American Eagle carriers, American receives all passenger revenue from flights performed for it by the American Eagle carriers and pays the American Eagle carriers a fee for each flight.

Amounts paid to the American Eagle carriers under the capacity purchase agreement are available to pay for various operating expenses of the American Eagle carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance, and other aircraft related expenses. As of

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the AAG's and American’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2013. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that AAG's and American’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013. During the quarter ending on December 31, 2013, AAG acquired US Airways Group. Other than the addition of US Airways Group's internal control over financial reporting and any related changes in control to integrate US Airways Group into AAG, there was no change in AAG’s or American's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AAG's and American's internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of AAG and American is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of AAG or American, respectively;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of AAG or American are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of AAG or American, respectively; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of AAG’s or America’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992 Framework).

Based on our assessment and those criteria, management concludes that AAG and American maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.

AAG’s and American's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of AAG’s and American's internal control over financial reporting. That report has been included herein.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

American Airlines Group Inc.

We have audited American Airlines Group Inc.’s (the Company) (formerly AMR Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (the COSO criteria). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting." Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We did not audit the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of US Airways Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary whose financial statements reflect total assets and operating revenues consisting of 39% and 3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effectiveness of US Airways Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting, inclusive of controls over the accounting for the Company’s business combination with US Airways Group, Inc., was audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the effectiveness of US Airways Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based upon the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit and the report of other auditors provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, American Airlines Group Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated

February 27, 2014

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
