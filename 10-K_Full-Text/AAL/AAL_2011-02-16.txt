PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October
    1982. Virtually all of AMR’s operations fall within the
    airline industry. AMR’s principal subsidiary, American
    Airlines, Inc. (American), was founded in 1934. At the end of
    2010, American provided scheduled jet service to approximately
    160 destinations throughout North America, the Caribbean, Latin
    America, Europe and Asia.

AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle), a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of AMR, owns two regional airlines which do business
    as “American Eagle” — American Eagle
    Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, the
    American
    Eagle

®

carriers). American also contracts with an independently owned
    regional airline, which does business as
    “AmericanConnection” (the
    AmericanConnection

®

carrier).

The AMR Eagle fleet is operated to feed passenger traffic to
    American pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement between
    American and AMR Eagle under which American receives all
    passenger revenue from flights and pays AMR Eagle a fee for each
    flight. The capacity purchase agreement reflects what the
    Company believes are current market rates received by other
    regional carriers for similar flying. Amounts paid to AMR Eagle
    under the capacity purchase agreement are available to pay for
    various operating expenses of AMR Eagle, such as crew expenses,
    maintenance and aircraft ownership. As of December 31,
    2010, AMR Eagle operated approximately 1,500 daily departures,
    offering scheduled passenger service to over 175 destinations in
    North America, Mexico and the Caribbean. On a separate company
    basis, AMR Eagle reported $2.3 billion in revenue in 2010.
    However, this historical financial information is not indicative
    of what AMR Eagle’s future revenues might be if AMR Eagle
    were a stand-alone entity.

American, AMR Eagle and the
    AmericanConnection

®

airline serve more than 250 cities in approximately
    50 countries with, on average, 3,400 daily flights. The
    combined network fleet numbers approximately 900 aircraft.
    American Airlines is also a founding member of

one

world

®

alliance, which enables member airlines to offer their customers
    more services and benefits than any member airline can provide
    individually. These services include a broader route network,
    opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles across the
    combined

one

world network and more airport lounges.
    Together,

one

world members serve 750 destinations in
    approximately 150 countries, with about 8,500 daily
    departures. American is also one of the largest scheduled air
    freight carriers in the world, providing a wide range of freight
    and mail services to shippers throughout its system onboard
    American’s passenger fleet.

Competition

Domestic Air Transportation

The domestic
    airline industry is fiercely competitive. Currently, any
    United States (U.S.) air carrier deemed fit by the
    U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is free to operate
    scheduled passenger service between any two points within the
    U.S. and its possessions. Most major air carriers have
    developed

hub-and-spoke

systems and schedule patterns in an effort to maximize the
    revenue potential of their service. American operates in five
    primary domestic markets: Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago
    O’Hare, Miami, New York City and Los Angeles.

The American
    Eagle

®

carriers increase the number of markets the Company serves by
    providing connections at American’s primary markets. The
    AmericanConnection

®

carrier currently provides connecting service to American
    through Chicago O’Hare. American’s competitors also
    own or have marketing agreements with regional carriers which
    provide similar services at their major hubs and other locations.

On most of its domestic non-stop routes, the Company faces
    competing service from at least one, and sometimes more than
    one, domestic airline including: AirTran Airways (Air Tran),
    Alaska Airlines (Alaska), Continental Airlines (Continental),
    Delta Air Lines (including Northwest Airlines) (Delta), Frontier
    Airlines, JetBlue Airways (JetBlue), Hawaiian Airlines,
    Southwest Airlines (Southwest), Spirit Airlines, United Airlines
    (United), US Airways, Virgin America Airlines and their
    affiliated regional carriers. Competition is even greater
    between cities that require a connection, where the major
    airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, the
    Company faces competition on some of its connecting routes from
    carriers operating

point-to-point

service on such


routes. The Company also competes with all-cargo and charter
    carriers and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail
    transportation. On all of its routes, pricing decisions are
    affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from
    other airlines.

American commenced commercial collaboration in New York and
    Boston with JetBlue during 2010. American’s agreement with
    JetBlue provides customers with interline service in
    non-overlapping markets, letting customers connect between 15 of
    American’s international destinations from New York and
    Boston and 26 domestic cities flown by JetBlue. Further,
    American expanded its relationship with JetBlue so that
    AAdvantage members and members of JetBlue’s customer
    loyalty program will be able to earn AAdvantage miles or JetBlue
    points, respectively, when they fly on American and JetBlue
    cooperative interline routes.

Most of the Company’s largest domestic competitors and
    several smaller carriers have reorganized under the protection
    of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
    (Chapter 11) in recent years. It is possible that in
    the future one or more of the Company’s competitors may
    seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11. Successful
    reorganizations present the Company with competitors with
    significantly lower operating costs derived from renegotiated
    labor, supply and financing contracts.

International Air Transportation

In addition
    to its extensive domestic service, the Company provides
    international service to the Caribbean, Canada, Latin America,
    Europe and Asia. The Company’s operating revenues from
    foreign operations (flights serving international destinations)
    were approximately 40 percent of the Company’s total
    operating revenues in each of the three years 2010, 2009, and
    2008. Additional information about the Company’s foreign
    operations is included in Note 14 to the consolidated
    financial statements.

In providing international air transportation, the Company
    competes with foreign investor-owned carriers, foreign
    state-owned carriers and U.S. airlines that have been
    granted authority to provide scheduled passenger and cargo
    service between the U.S. and various overseas locations. In
    general, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly
    connect passengers to and from markets beyond the nonstop city
    pair have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however,
    foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to
    carry passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign
    countries. To improve access to each other’s markets,
    various U.S. and foreign air carriers — including
    American — have established marketing relationships
    with other airlines and rail companies. American currently has
    marketing relationships with Air Berlin, Air Pacific, Air Tahiti
    Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Pacific,
    China Eastern Airlines, Dragonair, Deutsche Bahn German Rail, EL
    AL, Etihad Airways, EVA Air, Finnair, GOL, Gulf Air, Hawaiian
    Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines (JAL), Jet Airways, JetStar
    Airways, LAN (includes LAN Airlines, LAN Argentina, LAN Ecuador
    and LAN Peru), Malév Hungarian Airlines, Niki Airlines,
    Qantas Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, and Vietnam
    Airlines.

American is also a founding member of the

one

world
    alliance, which includes British Airways, Cathay Pacific,
    Finnair, LAN Airlines, Iberia, Qantas, JAL, Malév
    Hungarian, Mexicana, Royal Jordanian and S7 Airlines.
    S7 Airlines, which is Russia’s largest domestic
    airline, joined the

one

world alliance in November 2010.
    Kingfisher, India’s leading domestic airline, is scheduled
    to join the alliance in 2011 and Air Berlin, the 5th largest
    airline in Europe, is scheduled to join in 2012. The

one

world alliance links the networks of the member
    carriers to enhance customer service and smooth connections to
    the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the
    carriers’ frequent flyer programs and access to the
    carriers’ airport lounge facilities.

In July 2010, American obtained clearance from the European
    Commission (EC) and approval by the DOT for antitrust immunity
    (ATI) for its cooperation with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair
    and Royal Jordanian. This approval enables American, British
    Airways and Iberia, through a joint business agreement (JBA), to
    cooperate on flights between North America and most countries in
    Europe, and allows pooling and sharing of certain revenues and
    costs, expanded codesharing, enhanced frequent flyer program
    reciprocity, and cooperation in other areas. American began
    implementation of the JBA with British Airways and Iberia and
    expanded cooperation with Finnair and Royal Jordanian in October
    2010.

In February 2010, American and JAL entered into a JBA which will
    enhance their scope of cooperation on routes between North
    America and Asia through adjustments to their respective
    networks, flight schedules, and other business activities. This,
    in turn, will allow both carriers to better complement each
    other’s operations and to develop and offer competitive
    products and quality service to their customers. In the fourth
    quarter of 2010,


American and JAL received approval for ATI on certain routes
    between North America and Asia from the DOT and the Ministry of
    Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan (MLIT).
    Implementation of the JBA is subject to successful negotiation
    of certain detailed financial and commercial arrangements and
    other approvals. American expects to begin implementing the JBA
    with JAL in 2011.

Price Competition

The airline industry is
    characterized by substantial and intense price competition. Fare
    discounting by competitors has historically had a negative
    effect on the Company’s financial results because the
    Company is generally required to match competitors’ fares,
    as failing to match would provide even less revenue due to
    customers’ price sensitivity.

There are a number of low-cost carriers (LCCs) in the domestic
    market and the Company competes with LCCs over a very large part
    of its network. Several major airlines, including the Company,
    have implemented efforts to lower their costs since lower cost
    structures enable airlines to offer lower fares. In addition,
    several air carriers have reorganized in recent years under
    Chapter 11, including United, Delta and US Airways. These
    cost reduction efforts and bankruptcy reorganizations have
    allowed carriers to decrease operating costs. In the past, lower
    cost structures have generally resulted in fare reductions. If
    fare reductions by the Company are not offset by increases in
    passenger traffic, changes in the mix of traffic that improve
    yields

and/or

cost
    reductions, the Company’s operating results will be
    negatively impacted.

Regulation

General

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978,
    as amended, eliminated most domestic economic regulation of
    passenger and freight transportation. However, DOT and the
    Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still exercise certain
    regulatory authority over air carriers. DOT maintains
    jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare
    agreements, international route authorities, certain consumer
    protection and competition matters, such as advertising, denied
    boarding compensation and baggage liability.

The FAA regulates flying operations generally, including
    establishing standards for personnel, aircraft and certain
    security measures. As part of that oversight, the FAA has
    implemented a number of requirements that the Company has
    incorporated and is incorporating into its maintenance programs.
    The Company is progressing toward the completion of over 500
    airworthiness directives, a number of which require the Company
    to perform significant maintenance work and to incur additional
    expenses. Based on its current implementation schedule, the
    Company expects to be in compliance with the applicable
    requirements within the required time periods. DOT and DOJ have
    jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The
    U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects
    of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor
    relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under
    the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation
    Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between
    airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and
    collective bargaining agreements. In addition, as a result of
    heightened levels of concern regarding data privacy, the Company
    is subject to an increasing number of domestic and foreign laws
    regarding the privacy and security of passenger and employee
    data.

In December 2009, the DOT issued a new rule intended to enhance
    air passenger protections. The new rule, which went into effect
    in April 2010, created new areas of regulation in passenger
    protection, including a requirement that certain carriers,
    including American, adopt contingency plans for lengthy tarmac
    delays at most U.S. airports. A carrier’s failure to
    meet certain service performance criteria under the rule could
    subject it to substantial civil penalties.

On September 10, 2010, the FAA introduced a Notice of
    Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to change for all carriers
    certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation
    Regulations, including American and the AMR Eagle carriers, the
    required amount and timing of rest periods for pilots between
    work assignments, modifying duty and rest requirements based on
    the time of day, number of scheduled segments, flight types,
    time zones and other factors. The Company and other carriers are
    seeking clarification with the FAA of certain provisions of the
    proposed rule changes to determine if the new requirements could
    have a material adverse impact on the Company. If these
    regulations were promulgated in their current form, we believe
    they could have a material adverse impact on the Company.


International

International air
    transportation is subject to extensive government regulation.
    The Company’s operating authority in international markets
    is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the
    respective countries or governmental authorities (such as the
    European Union), and in some cases, fares and schedules require
    the approval of DOT

and/or

the
    relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with
    international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and
    regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral and
    multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign
    governments of countries served by the Company are periodically
    subject to renegotiation. Changes in U.S. or foreign
    government aviation policies could result in the alteration or
    termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route
    authorities, or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s
    international operations. In addition, at some foreign airports,
    an air carrier needs slots (landing and take-off authorizations)
    before the air carrier can introduce new service or increase
    existing service. The availability of such slots is not assured
    and the inability of the Company to obtain and retain needed
    slots could therefore inhibit its efforts to compete in certain
    international markets.

In April 2007, the U.S. and the EU approved an open skies
    air services agreement that provides airlines from the
    U.S. and EU member states open access to each other’s
    markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly
    beyond the U.S. and any airport in the EU including
    London’s Heathrow Airport. The provisions of the agreement
    took effect on March 30, 2008. Under the agreement, every
    U.S. and EU airline is authorized to operate between
    airports in the U.S. and Heathrow. Notwithstanding the open
    skies agreement, Heathrow is a slot-controlled airport. The
    agreement has resulted in the Company facing increased
    competition in serving Heathrow. The Company is also facing
    competition in other European markets. In March 2010, the EU and
    the U.S. committed to the extension of the “open
    skies” air services agreement. The extension of this
    agreement reinforces the relationship between the EU and the
    U.S. and furthers the cause of aviation liberalization. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 11 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

In December 2009, the U.S. and Japan reached a tentative
    open skies air services agreement that provides airlines from
    the U.S. and Japan open access to each other’s
    markets. The tentative agreement was signed by U.S. and
    Japanese representatives on October 25, 2010. The open
    skies agreement enables carriers of the two parties to operate
    between any two airports in the U.S. and Japan as well as
    fly to points beyond the two countries without restriction.

The U.S. and Colombia reached an open skies aviation pact
    in November 2010 that will remove restrictions between the two
    countries by the end of 2012. The proposed deal, which still
    needs to be finalized, will remove existing restrictions on the
    number of flights that can be operated between the countries.
    Also in 2010, the U.S. and Brazil entered into an open
    skies aviation services agreement that will provide for a
    phase-in of open skies by October 2015. The agreement
    immediately removes restrictions on pricing and on the routes
    between each country that can be served by U.S. and
    Brazilian scheduled and charter airlines.

Security

In November 2001, the Aviation and
    Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted in the
    U.S. The ATSA created a new government agency, the
    Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is part of
    the Department of Homeland Security and is responsible for
    aviation security. The ATSA mandates that the TSA provide for
    the screening of all passengers and property, including
    U.S. mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other
    articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft. The
    ATSA also provides for security in flight decks of aircraft and
    requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights.

Effective February 1, 2002, the ATSA imposed a $2.50 per
    enplanement security service fee, which is being collected by
    the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for
    these enhanced security measures. Additionally, air carriers are
    annually required to submit to the government an amount equal to
    what the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property
    in 2000. In recent years, the government has sought to increase
    both of these fees under spending proposals for the Department
    of Homeland Security. American and other carriers have announced
    their opposition to these proposals as there is no assurance
    that any increase in fees could be passed on to customers.

Airline Fares

Airlines are permitted to
    establish their own domestic fares without governmental
    regulation. DOT maintains authority over certain international
    fares, rates and charges, but applies this authority on a
    limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are
    sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the
    foreign countries which the Company serves. While air carriers
    are required to file and adhere to international fare


and rate tariffs, substantial commissions, fare overrides and
    discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize
    many international markets.

Airport Access

Operations at four major
    domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by the
    Company are regulated by governmental entities through
    allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory
    mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct
    operations at those airports. Each slot represents the
    authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport
    during a specified time period.

In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of
    slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations, or similar
    capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan National in
    Washington, D.C., LaGuardia and JFK in New York, and
    Newark. The Company’s operations at these airports
    generally require the allocation of slots or analogous
    regulatory authorities. Similarly, the Company’s operations
    at Tokyo’s Narita Airport, London’s Heathrow Airport
    and other international airports are regulated by local slot
    coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport
    Association’s Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and
    applicable local law. The Company currently has sufficient slots
    or analogous authorizations to operate its existing flights, and
    it has generally been able to obtain the rights to expand its
    operations and to change its schedules. There is no assurance,
    however, that the Company will be able to do so in the future
    because, among other reasons, such allocations are subject to
    changes in governmental policies.

In 2006, the Wright Amendment Reform Act of 2006 (the Act)
    became law. The Act is based on an agreement by the cities of
    Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, DFW International Airport,
    Southwest, and the Company to modify the Wright Amendment, which
    authorizes certain flight operations at Dallas Love Field within
    defined geographic areas. Among other things, the Act eventually
    eliminates domestic geographic restrictions on operations while
    limiting the maximum number of gates at Love Field. The Company
    believes the Act is a pragmatic resolution of the issues related
    to the Wright Amendment and the use of Love Field.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject
    to various laws and government regulations concerning
    environmental matters and employee safety and health in the
    U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have
    a particular impact on the Company include the Airport Noise and
    Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the Clean Air Act, the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe
    Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the
    Superfund Act). Certain operations of the Company concerning
    employee safety and health matters are also subject to the
    oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    (OSHA). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
    OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to
    promulgate regulations that have an impact on the Company’s
    operations. In addition to these federal activities, various
    states have been delegated certain authorities under the
    aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local
    governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and
    health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to or
    stricter than federal requirements.

The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise
    problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as
    they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign
    commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities
    in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction
    programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The
    ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions
    on aircraft. While the Company has had sufficient scheduling
    flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to
    date, the Company’s operations could be adversely affected
    if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or
    widespread.

Many aspects of the Company’s operations are subject to
    increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Concerns about
    climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, in particular, may
    result in the imposition of additional legislation or
    regulation. For example, the EU recently approved measures that
    impose emissions limits on airlines with operations to, from or
    within the EU as part of an emissions trading system beginning
    in 2012. The Company is continuing to assess the potential costs
    of the EU measures. Such legislative or regulatory action by the
    U.S., state or foreign governments currently or in the future
    may adversely affect the Company’s business and financial
    results. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional
    information.

The environmental laws to which the Company is subject include
    those related to responsibility for potential soil and
    groundwater contamination. The Company is conducting
    investigation and remediation activities to address soil and
    groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and
    maintenance bases. The Company


anticipates that the ongoing costs of such activities will be
    immaterial. The Company has also been named as a potentially
    responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. The
    Company’s alleged volumetric contributions at such sites
    are small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs and
    the Company expects that any future payments of its share of
    costs at such sites will be immaterial.

Labor

The airline business is labor intensive. Wages, salaries and
    benefits represented approximately 31 percent of the
    Company’s consolidated operating expenses for the year
    ended December 31, 2010. The average full-time equivalent
    number of employees of the Company’s subsidiaries for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 was 78,250.

The majority of these employees are represented by labor unions
    and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Relations with
    such labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act
    (RLA). Under this act, the collective bargaining agreements
    among the Company’s subsidiaries and these organizations
    generally do not expire but instead become amendable as of a
    stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any
    such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner
    prescribed under the RLA and as agreed to by the parties. Under
    the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for
    direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either
    party may request the NMB to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA
    prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and
    mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last
    for many months, and even for several years. If no agreement is
    reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at
    some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared,
    the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either
    party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is
    rejected by either party, a

30-day

“cooling off” period commences. During that period (or
    after), a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established,
    which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a
    solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed
    by another “cooling off” period of 30 days. At
    the end of a “cooling off” period, unless an agreement
    is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor
    organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a
    strike, and the airline may resort to its own
    “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of
    its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to
    replace any striking workers.

In April 2003, American reached agreements (the Labor
    Agreements) with its three major unions: the Allied Pilots
    Association (the APA) which represents American’s pilots,
    the Transport Workers Union of America

(AFL-CIO)

(the TWU), which represents seven different employee groups, and
    the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (the APFA),
    which represents American’s flight attendants. The Labor
    Agreements substantially moderated the labor costs associated
    with the employees represented by the unions. In conjunction
    with the Labor Agreements, American also implemented various
    changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-unionized
    personnel, including officers and other management (the
    Management Reductions). The Labor Agreements became amendable in
    2008 (although the parties agreed that they could begin the
    negotiations process as early as 2006).

In 2006, American and the APA commenced negotiations under the
    RLA. In April of 2008, following a request by the APA, a
    mediator was appointed by the NMB. The parties have been in
    mediated negotiations since that time. The APA has filed a
    number of grievances, lawsuits and complaints, most of which
    American believes are part of a corporate campaign related to
    the union’s labor agreement negotiations with American.
    While American is vigorously defending these claims, and has
    achieved favorable outcomes in many of them, a number still are
    ongoing and unfavorable outcomes of one or more of them could
    require American to incur additional costs, change the way it
    conducts some parts of its business, or otherwise adversely
    affect the Company.

Also in 2006, American and the TWU commenced negotiations with
    respect only to dispatchers, one of the seven groups at American
    represented by the TWU. Subsequently, following a request by the
    parties, a mediator was appointed by the NMB for the dispatcher
    negotiations. Thereafter, in November 2007, American and the TWU
    commenced negotiations under the RLA with respect to the other
    employee groups represented by the TWU. Direct negotiations
    between American and the TWU employees with respect to those
    other groups continued until December 2008, at which time the
    parties jointly filed with the NMB for mediation with respect to
    the fleet service, stores, ground school instructors, and
    simulator technician groups of employees. The NMB appointed a
    mediator soon thereafter. Then, in February 2009, following a
    request by the TWU, a mediator was appointed by the NMB


with respect to the mechanics and the technical specialists. The
    Company negotiated tentative agreements with several workgroups
    within the TWU, including the Maintenance Control Technician
    group, the Material Logistics Specialists group and the Mechanic
    and Related group. Agreements with the TWU groups are subject to
    ratification by the relevant membership of TWU, and while the
    Maintenance Control Technician group ratified their agreement,
    the Material Logistics Specialists group and the Mechanic and
    Related group tentative agreements were not ratified. Mediated
    negotiations with the TWU with respect to those groups continue.

American and the APFA commenced negotiations in the first half
    of 2008. Direct negotiations between the parties continued until
    December 2008, at which time the parties jointly filed an
    application to the NMB asking that a mediator be appointed. The
    NMB appointed a mediator soon thereafter. Since that time, the
    parties have been conducting mediated negotiations as scheduled
    by the NMB.

The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents
    American Eagle pilots, reached agreement with American Eagle
    effective September 1, 1997, to have all of the pilots of
    the American
    Eagle

®

carriers (currently American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive
    Airlines, Inc.) covered by a single contract. This agreement
    lasts until January 1, 2013. The agreement provided to the
    parties the right to seek limited changes in 2000, 2004 and
    2008. If the parties were unable to agree on the limited
    changes, the agreement provided that any issues would be
    resolved by interest arbitration, without the exercise of
    self-help (such as a strike). ALPA and American Eagle negotiated
    a tentative agreement in 2000, but that agreement failed in
    ratification. Thereafter, the parties participated in interest
    arbitration. The interest arbitration panel determined the
    limited changes that should be made and these changes were
    appropriately effected. In 2004 and in 2008, the parties
    successfully negotiated limited changes. The pilot agreement is
    amendable January 1, 2013; however, the parties have agreed
    that contract openers may be exchanged 120 days prior to
    that date.

The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) represents the flight
    attendants of the American Eagle carriers. The current agreement
    between the American Eagle carriers and the AFA became amendable
    on October 27, 2009. The parties are in direct negotiations.

The other union employees at the American Eagle carriers are
    covered by separate agreements with the TWU. The agreements
    between the American Eagle carriers and the TWU were amendable
    beginning on October 1, 2007, and the parties commenced
    negotiations. In January 2009, an application for mediation was
    filed with the NMB and a mediator was appointed to assist the
    parties. In January 2010, American Eagle and the TWU reached a
    tentative agreement with respect to aircraft maintenance
    technicians and fleet service clerks for 24 months,
    effective the date of signing. The mechanics ratified the
    tentative agreement in March of 2010. The fleet service clerks
    failed to ratify the January 2010 tentative agreement. A second
    tentative agreement was reached with the TWU with respect to the
    fleet service clerks in June of 2010; that tentative agreement
    also was not ratified. Mediation with the TWU concerning
    American Eagle’s dispatchers and fleet services clerks
    continues.

Fuel

The Company’s operations and financial results are
    significantly affected by the availability and price of jet
    fuel. The Company’s fuel costs and consumption for the
    years 2008 through 2010 were:

The impact of fuel price changes on the Company and its
    competitors depends on various factors, including hedging
    strategies. The Company has a fuel hedging program in which it
    enters into jet fuel and heating oil hedging contracts to dampen
    the impact of the volatility of jet fuel prices. The Company
    does not take a view on the direction of fuel prices; instead,
    the Company layers in fuel hedges on a systematic basis. As a
    result, the impact on the Company from its fuel hedging program
    can be very different from the impact of fuel hedging on the
    Company’s competitors who follow a different hedging
    philosophy. Depending on movements in the price of fuel, the
    Company’s fuel hedging program can result in gains or
    losses on its fuel hedges.


During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company’s fuel hedging
    program increased (decreased) the Company’s fuel expense by
    approximately $142 million, $651 million and
    ($380) million, respectively. As of January 2011, the
    Company had cash flow hedges, with option contracts, primarily
    heating oil collars and call options, covering approximately
    35 percent of its estimated 2011 fuel requirements. The
    consumption hedged for 2011 by cash flow hedges is capped at an
    average price of approximately $2.52 per gallon of jet fuel, and
    the Company’s collars have an average floor price of
    approximately $1.92 per gallon of jet fuel (both the capped and
    floor price exclude taxes and transportation costs). A
    deterioration of the Company’s financial position could
    negatively affect the Company’s ability to hedge fuel in
    the future. See the Risk Factors under Item 1A for
    additional information regarding fuel.

Additional information regarding the Company’s fuel program
    is also included in Item 7(A) “Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” Item 7
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 7 to
    the consolidated financial statements.

Frequent
    Flyer Program

American established the
    AAdvantage

®

frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) to develop passenger loyalty
    by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage.
    The Company believes that the AAdvantage program is one of its
    competitive strengths. AAdvantage benefits from a growing base
    of approximately 67 million members with desirable
    demographics who have demonstrated a strong willingness to
    collect AAdvantage miles over other loyalty program incentives
    and are generally disposed to adjusting their purchasing
    behavior in order to earn additional AAdvantage miles.
    AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American,
    American Eagle, and the
    AmericanConnection

®

carrier or by using services of other participants in the
    AAdvantage program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free,
    discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or
    other participating airlines, or for other awards. Once a member
    accrues sufficient mileage for an award, the member may book
    award travel. Most travel awards are subject to capacity
    controlled seating. A member’s mileage credit does not
    expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying
    activity at least once every 18 months.

American sells mileage credits and related services to other
    participants in the AAdvantage program. There are over 1,000
    program participants, including a leading credit card issuer,
    hotels, car rental companies and other products and services
    companies in the AAdvantage program. The Company believes that
    program participants benefit from the sustained purchasing
    behavior of AAdvantage members, which translates into a
    recurring stream of revenues for AAdvantage. Under its
    agreements with AAdvantage members and program participants, the
    Company reserves the right to change the AAdvantage program at
    any time without notice, and may end the program with six months
    notice. As of December 31, 2010, AAdvantage had
    approximately 67 million total members, and
    587 billion outstanding award miles. During 2010,
    AAdvantage issued approximately 185 billion miles, of which
    approximately 62% were sold to program participants. See
    “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” under
    Item 7 for more information on AAdvantage.

Cargo

American Airlines Cargo, a division of American Airlines, Inc.,
    provides over 90 million pounds of weekly cargo lift
    capacity to major cities in the United States, Europe, Canada,
    Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America and Asia. American’s
    cargo network is one of the largest air cargo networks in the
    world, with facilities and interline connections available
    across the globe. During 2010, American Airlines Cargo accounted
    for approximately 3.0% of the Company’s operating revenues
    by generating $672 million in freight and mail revenue, an
    increase of 16.3% versus 2009.

Other
    revenues

Other revenues, which approximate 10.8% of total revenues,
    includes revenue from the marketing services related to the sale
    of mileage credits in the AAdvantage program as discussed above,
    membership fees and related revenue from the Company’s
    Admirals Club operations, and other miscellaneous service
    revenue, including administrative service charges and baggage
    handling fees. Other revenues have been increasing as the
    Company unbundles its services and charges for ancillary
    services.


Other
    Matters

Seasonality and Other Factors

The
    Company’s results of operations for any interim period are
    not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year since
    the air transportation business is subject to seasonal
    fluctuations. Higher demand for air travel has traditionally
    resulted in more favorable operating and financial results for
    the second and third quarters of the year than for the first and
    fourth quarters. Fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives,
    fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural
    disasters, outbreaks of disease, and other factors could impact
    this seasonal pattern. Unaudited quarterly financial data for
    the two-year period ended December 31, 2010 is included in
    Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. In
    addition, the results of operations in the air transportation
    business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in
    response to general economic conditions.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance for
    public liability, passenger liability, property damage and
    all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft. As a result of the
    terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (the Terrorist
    Attacks), aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of
    insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for
    liability to persons other than employees or passengers for
    claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events
    (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these insurers
    significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in
    general. While the price of commercial insurance has declined
    since the period immediately after the Terrorist Attacks, in the
    event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of
    insurance coverage available to the Company, or significantly
    increase its cost, the Company would be adversely affected.

The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial
    war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines through
    September 30, 2011, covering losses to employees,
    passengers, third parties and aircraft. If the
    U.S. government were to cease providing such insurance in
    whole or in part, it is likely that the Company could obtain
    comparable coverage in the commercial market, but the Company
    would incur substantially higher premiums and more restrictive
    terms. There can be no assurance that comparable war-risk
    coverage will be available in the commercial market. If the
    Company is unable to obtain adequate war-risk coverage at
    commercially reasonable rates, the Company would be adversely
    affected.

Other Government Matters

In time of war or
    during a national emergency or defense oriented situation,
    American and other air carriers can be required to provide
    airlift services to the Air Mobility Command under the Civil
    Reserve Air Fleet program. In the event the Company has to
    provide a substantial number of aircraft and crew to the Air
    Mobility Command, its operations could be adversely impacted.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our ability to become profitable and our ability to continue to
    fund our obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number
    of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond our control.

As a
    result of significant losses in recent years, our financial
    condition has been materially weakened.

We incurred significant losses in recent years, which has
    materially weakened our financial condition. We lost
    $893 million in 2005, $781 million in 2004,
    $1.2 billion in 2003, $3.5 billion in 2002 and
    $1.8 billion in 2001. Although we earned a profit of
    $456 million in 2007 and $189 million in 2006, we lost
    $2.1 billion in 2008 (which included a $1.2 billion
    impairment charge), and, primarily as a result of very weak
    demand for air travel driven by the severe downturn in the
    global economy, we lost $1.5 billion in 2009 and
    $471 million in 2010. Because of our weakened financial
    condition, we are vulnerable both to the impact of unexpected
    events (such as terrorist attacks) and to deterioration of the
    operating environment (such as a significant increase in jet
    fuel prices or significant increased competition).

The
    severe global economic downturn resulted in very weak demand for
    air travel and lower investment asset returns, which has had and
    could continue to have a significant negative impact on
    us.

Although demand for air travel has improved as the global
    economy continues to recover from the recent severe downturn,
    demand continues to be weak by historical standards. We began to
    experience weakening demand late in 2008, and this weakness
    continued into 2010. We reduced capacity in 2008, and in the
    first half of 2009 we announced additional reductions to our
    capacity plan. In connection with these capacity reductions, the
    Company incurred special charges related to aircraft, employee
    reductions and certain other charges. Demand for air travel may
    weaken if the global economy does not continue to recover. No
    assurance can be given that capacity adjustments or other steps
    we may take in response to changes in demand will be successful.
    Capacity reductions or other steps might result in additional
    special charges in the future. Further, other carriers may make
    capacity adjustments which may reduce the expected benefits of
    any steps we may take to respond to changes in demand.
    Industry-wide capacity may increase to the extent the economy
    continues to recover from the global recession. If industry
    capacity increases, and if consumer demand does not continue to
    pace those increases, we, and the airline industry as a whole,
    could be negatively impacted.

The economic downturn has resulted in broadly lower investment
    asset returns and values. Our pension assets suffered a material
    decrease in value in 2008 related to broader stock market
    declines, which resulted in higher pension expense in 2009 and
    2010 and will result in higher pension expense and higher
    required contributions in future years. In addition, under
    certain circumstances, we may be required to maintain cash
    reserves under our credit card processing agreements and to post
    cash collateral on fuel hedging contracts. These issues
    individually or collectively may have a material adverse impact
    on our liquidity. Also, disruptions in the capital markets and
    other sources of funding may make it impossible for us to obtain
    necessary additional funding or make the cost of that funding
    prohibitive.

We
    face numerous challenges as we seek to maintain sufficient
    liquidity, and we will need to raise substantial additional
    funds. We may not be able to raise those funds, or to do so on
    acceptable terms.

In the next several years, we have significant debt, lease and
    other obligations, including significant pension funding
    obligations. We also expect to make substantial capital
    expenditures during that time. For example, in 2011, we will be
    required to make approximately $2.5 billion of principal
    payments on long-term debt and capital leases, and we expect to
    spend approximately $1.6 billion on capital expenditures,
    including aircraft commitments. In addition, in 2011, we are
    required to contribute approximately $520 million to our
    pension plans. Moreover, the global economic downturn, rising
    fuel prices, the potential obligation to post reserves under
    credit card processing agreements and the potential obligation
    to post cash collateral on fuel hedging contracts, among other
    things, have negatively impacted, and may in the future
    negatively impact, our liquidity. To meet our commitments and to
    maintain sufficient liquidity as we continue to implement our
    revenue enhancement and cost reduction initiatives, we will need
    continued access to substantial additional funding. Moreover,
    while we have arranged financings that, subject to certain terms
    and conditions (including, in the case of financing arrangements
    covering a significant


number of aircraft, a condition that, at the time of borrowing,
    we have a certain amount of unrestricted cash and short term
    investments), cover all of our aircraft delivery commitments
    through 2011, we will continue to need to raise substantial
    additional funds to meet our commitments.

Our ability to obtain future financing is limited by the value
    of our unencumbered assets. Almost all of our aircraft assets
    (including aircraft eligible for the benefits of
    Section 1110) are encumbered as a result of financing
    activity in recent years. This financing activity has
    significantly reduced the quantity of our assets which could be
    used as collateral in future financing. Also, the market value
    of our aircraft assets has declined in recent years, and may
    continue to decline. In addition, many of the other financing
    sources traditionally available to us may be difficult to
    access, and no assurance can be given as to the amount of
    financing available to us.

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (the
    “Terrorist Attacks”), our credit ratings have been
    lowered to significantly below investment grade. These
    reductions have increased our borrowing costs and otherwise
    adversely affected borrowing terms, and limited borrowing
    options. Additional reductions in our credit ratings might have
    other effects on us, such as further increasing borrowing or
    other costs or further restricting our ability to raise funds.

A number of other factors, including our financial results in
    recent years, our substantial indebtedness, the difficult
    revenue environment we face, our reduced credit ratings, recent
    historically high fuel prices, and the financial difficulties
    experienced in the airline industry, adversely affect the
    availability and terms of funding for us. In addition, the
    global economic downturn resulted in greater volatility, less
    liquidity, widening of credit spreads, and substantially more
    limited availability of funding. As a result of these and other
    factors, although we believe we have or can access sufficient
    liquidity to fund our operations and obligations, there can be
    no assurances to that effect. An inability to obtain necessary
    additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material
    adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our
    operations.

We
    could be required to maintain reserves under our credit card
    processing agreements, which could materially adversely impact
    our liquidity.

American has agreements with a number of credit card companies
    and processors to accept credit cards for the sale of air travel
    and other services. Under certain of these agreements, the
    related credit card processor may hold back a reserve from
    American’s credit card receivables following the occurrence
    of certain events, including the failure of American to maintain
    certain levels of liquidity (as specified in each agreement).

Under such agreements, the amount of the reserve that may be
    required generally is based on the credit card processor’s
    exposure to the Company under the applicable agreement and, in
    the case of a reserve required because of American’s
    failure to maintain a certain level of liquidity, the amount of
    such liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was
    not required to maintain any reserve under such agreements. If
    circumstances were to occur that would allow the credit card
    processor to require the Company to maintain a reserve, the
    Company’s liquidity would be negatively impacted.

Our
    initiatives to generate additional revenues and to reduce our
    costs may not be adequate or successful.

As we seek to improve our financial condition, we must continue
    to take steps to generate additional revenues and to reduce our
    costs. Although we have a number of initiatives underway to
    address our cost and revenue challenges, some of these
    initiatives involve changes to our business which we may be
    unable to implement. In addition, it has become increasingly
    difficult to identify and implement significant revenue
    enhancement and cost savings initiatives. The adequacy and
    ultimate success of our initiatives to generate additional
    revenues and reduce our costs cannot be assured. Moreover,
    whether our initiatives will be adequate or successful depends
    in large measure on factors beyond our control, notably the
    overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield
    and industry capacity growth, and fuel prices. It will be very
    difficult for us to continue to fund our obligations on an
    ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the overall
    industry revenue environment does not continue to improve or if
    fuel prices were to increase and persist for an extended period
    at high levels.


We may
    be adversely affected by increases in fuel prices, and we would
    be adversely affected by disruptions in the supply of
    fuel.

Our results are very significantly affected by the cost, price
    volatility and the availability of jet fuel, which are in turn
    affected by a number of factors beyond our control. Due to the
    competitive nature of the airline industry, we may not be able
    to pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing
    fares. Although we had some success in raising fares and
    imposing fuel surcharges in reaction to high fuel prices, these
    fare increases and surcharges did not keep pace with the
    extraordinary increases in the price of fuel that occurred in
    2007 and 2008. Although fuel prices have abated considerably
    from the record high prices recorded in July 2008, they have
    steadily increased since the first quarter of 2009 and remain
    high and extremely volatile by historical standards.
    Furthermore, reduced demand or increased fare competition, or
    both, and resulting lower revenues may offset any potential
    benefit of any reductions in fuel prices.

While we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in
    fuel availability, dependence on foreign imports of crude oil,
    limited refining capacity and the possibility of changes in
    government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and
    marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability
    of jet fuel. If there are additional outbreaks of hostilities or
    other conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere, or a
    reduction in refining capacity (due to natural disasters or
    weather events, for example), or governmental limits on the
    production or sale of jet fuel (including as a consequence of
    increased environmental regulation), there could be a reduction
    in the supply of jet fuel and significant increases in the cost
    of jet fuel. Major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or
    significant increases in its cost would have a material adverse
    impact on us.

We have a large number of older aircraft in our fleet, and these
    aircraft are not as fuel efficient as more recent models of
    aircraft. We believe it is imperative that we continue to
    execute our fleet renewal plans. However, there will be
    significant delays in the deliveries of the Boeing

787-9

aircraft we currently have on order.

Our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide
    meaningful price protection. While we seek to manage the risk of
    fuel price increases by using derivative contracts, there can be
    no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives
    in place to provide any particular level of protection against
    increased fuel costs. In addition, a deterioration of our
    financial position could negatively affect our ability to enter
    into derivative contracts in the future. Moreover, declines in
    fuel prices below the levels established in derivative contracts
    may require us to post material amounts of cash collateral to
    secure the loss positions on such contracts, and if such
    contracts close when fuel prices are below the applicable
    levels, we would be required to make payments to close such
    contracts; these payments would be treated as additional fuel
    expense.

We
    could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to
    resolve favorably our pending litigation with certain Global
    Distribution Systems (GDSs) and business discussions with
    certain on-line travel agents.

We are currently involved in litigation with certain GDSs and in
    business discussions with certain on-line travel agents. An
    adverse outcome in any of these matters could have a material
    adverse effect on our level of bookings, business and results of
    operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” — GDS Discussion.” In addition,
    our contracts with the GDSs operated by Sabre, Travelport and
    Amadeus expire in 2011. We could be adversely affected if we are
    unable to renegotiate contract renewals on acceptable terms.

Our
    indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could
    adversely affect our business and liquidity.

We have and will continue to have significant amounts of
    indebtedness, obligations to make future payments on aircraft
    equipment and property leases, and obligations under aircraft
    purchase agreements, as well as a high proportion of debt to
    equity capital. We expect to incur substantial additional debt
    (including secured debt) and


lease obligations in the future. We also have substantial
    pension funding obligations. Our substantial indebtedness and
    other obligations have important consequences. For example, they:

•

limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working
    capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and
    general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on
    which such funding can be obtained;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other
    obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other
    purposes;

•

make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and catastrophic
    external events; and

•

limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce
    our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic
    conditions.

Our
    business is affected by many changing economic and other
    conditions beyond our control, and our results of operations
    tend to be volatile and fluctuate due to
    seasonality.

Our business and our results of operations are affected by many
    changing economic and other conditions beyond our control,
    including, among others:

•

actual or potential changes in international, national, regional
    and local economic, business and financial conditions, including
    recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist
    attacks or political instability;

•

changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns
    or demographic trends;

•

changes in the competitive environment due to industry
    consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations and
    other factors;

•

actual or potential disruptions to the air traffic control
    systems;

•

increases in costs of safety, security and environmental
    measures;

•

outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and

•

weather and natural disasters.

As a result, our results of operations tend to be volatile and
    subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to
    generally greater demand for air travel during the summer, our
    revenues in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be
    stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the
    year.

The
    airline industry is fiercely competitive and may undergo further
    consolidation or changes in industry alliances, and we are
    subject to increasing competition.

Service over almost all of our routes is highly competitive and
    fares remain at low levels by historical standards. We face
    vigorous, and, in some cases, increasing, competition from major
    domestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter
    carriers, foreign air carriers, low-cost carriers and,
    particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail
    transportation. We also face increasing and significant
    competition from marketing/operational alliances formed by our
    competitors. Competition with foreign air carriers and with such
    marketing/operational alliances has been increasing in recent
    years in part due to the adoption of liberalized open skies
    aviation agreements between the United States and an increasing
    number of countries around the world. Moreover, the percentage
    of routes on which we compete with carriers having substantially
    lower operating costs than ours has grown significantly over
    time, and we now compete with low-cost carriers over a very
    large part of our network. Our ability to compete effectively
    depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost
    structure. If we cannot do so, then our business, financial
    condition and operating results would be adversely affected.

Certain airline alliances have been, or may in the future be,
    granted immunity from antitrust regulations by governmental
    authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint
    pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by the
    Company’s competitors can undertake activities that are not
    available to the Company, the Company’s ability to
    effectively compete may be hindered.


Pricing decisions are significantly affected by competition from
    other airlines. Fare discounting by competitors historically has
    had a negative effect on our financial results because we must
    generally match competitors’ fares, since failing to match
    would result in even less revenue. We have faced increased
    competition from carriers with simplified fare structures, which
    are generally preferred by travelers. Any fare reduction or fare
    simplification initiative may not be offset by increases in
    passenger traffic, reduction in cost or changes in the mix of
    traffic that would improve yields. Moreover, decisions by our
    competitors that increase or reduce overall industry capacity,
    or capacity dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign
    region, market or route, can have a material impact on related
    fare levels.

There have been numerous mergers and acquisitions within the
    airline industry and numerous changes in industry alliances.
    Southwest Airlines and AirTran Airways announced during 2010
    plans to merge, and the recent mergers of United Air Lines, Inc.
    with Continental Airlines, Inc. and Delta Airlines with
    Northwest Airlines Corporation have resulted in the formation of
    larger competitors than the Company with more extensive networks
    than the Company. We are seeking to address these competitive
    challenges with our cornerstone market and alliance strategies;
    however, there can be no assurances as to the level of success
    of these strategies.

In the future, there may be additional mergers and acquisitions,
    and changes in airline alliances, including those in which the
    Company may participate and those that may be undertaken by
    others. Any airline industry consolidation or changes in airline
    alliances, including

one

world, could substantially alter
    the competitive landscape and result in changes in our corporate
    or business strategy. We regularly assess and explore the
    potential for consolidation in our industry and changes in
    airline alliances, our strategic position and ways to enhance
    our competitiveness, including the possibilities for our
    participation in merger activity. Consolidation involving other
    participants in our industry could result in the formation of
    one or more airlines with greater financial resources, more
    extensive networks,

and/or

lower
    cost structures than exist currently, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our competitive position and
    adversely affect our business and results of operations. For
    similar reasons, changes in airline alliances could have a
    similar impact on us.

In 2008, we entered into a joint business agreement and related
    marketing arrangements with British Airways and Iberia,
    providing for commercial cooperation on flights between North
    America and most countries in Europe, pooling and sharing of
    certain revenues and costs, expanded codesharing, enhanced
    frequent flyer program reciprocity, and cooperation in other
    areas. In July 2010, American obtained clearance from the
    European Commission (“

EC

”) and approval by the
    Department of Transportation (“

DOT

”) for
    antitrust immunity (“

ATI

”) for its planned
    cooperation with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair and Royal
    Jordanian. Regulatory conditions for ATI approval for the
    British Airways, Iberia, Finnair and Royal Jordanian cooperative
    agreement include a collective obligation of the Company,
    British Airways and Iberia to lease to other carriers up to
    seven takeoff and landing slot pairs at London Heathrow airport
    and up to three John F. Kennedy airport operational authorities,
    depending on market conditions. American began implementation of
    the JBA with British Airways and Iberia and expanded cooperation
    with Finnair and Royal Jordanian in October 2010. No assurances
    can be given as to any arrangements that may ultimately be
    implemented or any benefits that we may derive from such
    arrangements.

In February 2010, American and JAL announced the decision to
    strengthen their relationship. The carriers, both members of the

one

world alliance, jointly applied to DOT for ATI on
    certain routes, and jointly notified the Ministry of Land
    Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan of the proposed
    cooperation. As a part of the application, American and JAL
    entered into a joint business agreement which will enhance their
    scope of cooperation on routes between North America and Asia
    through adjustments to their respective networks, flight
    schedules, and other business activities. This, in turn, will
    allow both carriers to better complement each other’s
    operations and to develop and offer competitive products and
    quality service to their customers. In November 2010, American
    obtained approval by DOT for ATI for its planned cooperation
    with JAL. Implementation of the JBA with JAL is subject to
    successful negotiation of certain detailed financial and
    commercial arrangements and other approvals. American expects to
    begin implementing the JBA with JAL in 2011. No assurances can
    be given as to any arrangements that may ultimately be
    implemented or any benefits that we may derive from such
    arrangements.

Any plans to enter into or expand ATI joint business agreements
    or similar arrangements, including implementation of the joint
    business agreements referred to above, are subject to various
    conditions, including various U.S. and foreign regulatory
    approvals, successful negotiation of certain detailed financial
    and commercial


arrangements, and other approvals. Governmental entities from
    which such approvals must be obtained, including DOT and foreign
    governmental authorities or entities such as the EU, have
    imposed or may impose requirements or limitations as a condition
    of granting any such approvals, such as requiring divestiture of
    routes, gates, slots or other assets. No assurances can be given
    as to any arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any
    benefits we may derive from such arrangements.

We
    compete with reorganized carriers, which results in competitive
    disadvantages for us.

We must compete with air carriers that have reorganized under
    the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in
    recent years, including United, Delta and U.S. Airways. It
    is possible that other significant competitors may seek to
    reorganize in or out of Chapter 11.

Successful reorganizations by other carriers present us with
    competitors with significantly lower operating costs and
    stronger financial positions derived from renegotiated labor,
    supply, and financing contracts. These competitive pressures may
    limit our ability to adequately price our services, may require
    us to further reduce our operating costs, and could have a
    material adverse impact on us.

Fares
    are at low levels and our reduced pricing power adversely
    affects our ability to achieve adequate pricing, especially with
    respect to business travel.

Our passenger yield (on an inflation-adjusted basis) remains low
    by historical standards. We believe that this is due in large
    part to a corresponding decline in our pricing power. Our
    reduced pricing power is the product of several factors
    including: greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers
    (particularly business travelers); pricing transparency
    resulting from the use of the internet; greater competition from
    low-cost carriers and from carriers that have reorganized in
    recent years under the protection of Chapter 11; other
    carriers being better hedged against rising fuel costs and able
    to better absorb high jet fuel prices; fare simplification
    efforts by certain carriers; and the economy. We believe that
    this pricing environment could persist indefinitely.

Our
    corporate or business strategy may change.

In light of the rapid changes in the airline industry, we
    evaluate our assets on an ongoing basis with a view to
    maximizing their value to us and determining which are core to
    our operations. We also regularly evaluate our corporate and
    business strategies, and they are influenced by factors beyond
    our control, including changes in the competitive landscape we
    face. Our corporate and business strategies are, therefore,
    subject to change.

AMR is considering, and may engage in discussions with third
    parties regarding, the divestiture of AMR Eagle and other
    separation transactions, and may decide to proceed with one or
    more such transactions. There can be no assurance that AMR will
    complete any separation transactions or that any announced plans
    or transactions will be consummated, and no prediction can be
    made as to the impact of any such transactions on stockholder
    value or on us. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” — Recent Events.”

Our
    business is subject to extensive government regulation, which
    can result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our
    operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in
    the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages. In
    particular, recently enacted and possible future environmental
    regulations may adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international
    regulatory requirements. Many of these requirements result in
    significant costs. For example, the FAA from time to time issues
    directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and
    operation of aircraft. In addition, the FAA has recently
    proposed regulations that would affect crewmember hiring and
    crewmember rest and duty requirements. It is unknown at this
    time whether, and in what form, these regulations may be
    promulgated. However, if these regulations were promulgated in
    their current form, we believe they could have a material
    adverse impact on the Company. In addition, as a result of
    heightened levels of concern regarding data privacy, the Company
    is subject to an increasing number of domestic and foreign laws
    regarding the privacy and security of passenger and employee
    data.


Compliance with regulatory requirements drives significant
    expenditures and has in the past, and may in the future, cause
    disruptions to our operations. In addition, the ability of
    U.S. carriers to operate international routes is subject to
    change because the applicable arrangements between the
    U.S. and foreign governments may be amended from time to
    time (such as through the adoption of an open skies policy), or
    because appropriate slots or facilities are not made available.
    Any such change could adversely impact the value of our
    international route authorities and related assets.

Moreover, additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates
    and charges have been enacted from time to time that have
    significantly increased the costs of airline operations, reduced
    the demand for air travel or restricted the way we can conduct
    our business. For example, the ATSA, which became law in 2001,
    mandated the federalization of certain airport security
    procedures and resulted in the imposition of additional security
    requirements on airlines.

The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the
    manner in which we conduct our business each may be affected by
    changes in law and future actions taken by governmental
    agencies, including:

•

changes in law which affect the services that can be offered by
    airlines in particular markets and at particular airports, or
    the types of fees that can be charged to passengers;

•

the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals
    (including foreign government approvals) needed for codesharing
    alliances and other arrangements with other airlines;

•

restrictions on competitive practices (for example court orders,
    or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an
    airline’s ability to respond to a competitor);

•

the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations
    that impact customer service standards (for example,
    “passenger bill of rights”);

•

restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the
    use of takeoff and landing slots at airports or the auction or
    reallocation of slot rights currently or previously held by
    us; or

•

the adoption of more restrictive locally imposed noise
    restrictions.

In addition, the U.S. air traffic control (ATC) system,
    which is operated by the FAA, is not successfully managing the
    growing demand for U.S. air travel. U.S. airlines
    carry about 750 million passengers a year and are forecast
    to accommodate a billion passengers annually by 2021. Air
    traffic controllers rely on outdated technologies that routinely
    overwhelm the system and compel airlines to fly inefficient,
    indirect routes. We support a common sense approach to ATC
    modernization that would allocate costs to all ATC system users
    in proportion to the services they consume. Reauthorization of
    legislation that funds the FAA, which includes proposals
    regarding upgrades to the ATC system, is under consideration in
    Congress. It is uncertain whether such legislation will become
    law. In the meantime, FAA funding continues under temporary
    periodic extensions.

Many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly
    stringent environmental regulations. Concerns about climate
    change and greenhouse gas emissions, in particular, may result
    in the imposition of additional legislation or regulation. The
    EU has adopted a directive under which each EU member state is
    required to extend the existing EU emissions trading scheme
    (ETS) to aviation. This will require the Company to annually
    submit emission allowances in order to operate flights to and
    from EU member states in January 2012 and thereafter, including
    flights between the U.S. and EU member states. In December
    2009, the ATA, joined by American, Continental and United, filed
    a legal action in the United Kingdom challenging the
    implementation of the EU ETS as applied to aviation. We believe
    that non-EU governments are also likely to consider formal
    challenges to the EU ETS as applied to aviation. It is not clear
    whether the EU ETS will withstand such challenges. However,
    unless interim relief is granted, we will be required to
    continue to comply with the EU ETS during the pendency of the
    legal challenges. Although the cost of compliance with the EU
    ETS is difficult to predict given the uncertainty of a number of
    variables, such as the number and price of emission allowances
    we may be required to purchase, such costs could be significant.

Other legislative or regulatory actions addressing climate
    change and emissions from aviation that may be taken in the
    future by the U.S., state or foreign governments or through
    international treaties may adversely affect our business and
    financial results. The United Nations’ International Civil
    Aviation Organization (“ICAO”), for


example, recently adopted a resolution identifying certain fuel
    efficiency goals and emission trading system principles for
    international aviation, which may provide a basis for such
    future legislative or regulatory action. Climate change
    legislation was previously introduced in the U.S. Congress;
    such legislation could be re-introduced in the future by the
    U.S. Congress and state legislatures, and could contain
    provisions affecting the aviation industry. In addition, the EPA
    could seek to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft.
    It is currently unknown how climate change legislation or
    regulation, if enacted, would specifically apply to the aviation
    industry. However, the impact on us of any climate change
    legislation or regulation is likely to be adverse and related
    costs of compliance could be significant. Such legislation or
    regulation could result in, among other things, increased fuel
    costs, carbon taxes or fees, the imposition of requirements to
    purchase emission offsets or credits, increased aircraft and
    equipment costs, and restrictions on the growth of airline
    operations. We continue to evaluate ongoing climate change
    developments at the international, federal and state levels and
    assess the potential associated impacts on our business and
    operations.

We
    could be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist
    attacks.

Actual or threatened U.S. military involvement in overseas
    operations has, on occasion, had an adverse impact on our
    business, financial position (including access to capital
    markets) and results of operations, and on the airline industry
    in general. The continuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, or
    other conflicts or events in the Middle East or elsewhere, may
    result in similar adverse impacts.

The Terrorist Attacks had a material adverse impact on us. The
    occurrence of another terrorist attack (whether domestic or
    international and whether against us or another entity) could
    again have a material adverse impact on us.

Our
    international operations are subject to economic and political
    instability and could be adversely affected by numerous events,
    circumstances or government actions beyond our
    control.

Our current international activities and prospects could be
    adversely affected by factors such as reversals or delays in the
    opening of foreign markets, exchange controls, currency and
    political risks (including changes in exchange rates and
    currency devaluations), environmental regulation, increases in
    taxes and fees and changes in international government
    regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain
    or retain needed route authorities

and/or

slots.

For example, the open skies air services agreement between the
    U.S. and the EU which took effect in March 2008
    provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open
    access to each other’s markets, with freedom of pricing and
    unlimited rights to fly beyond the U.S. and any airport in
    the EU including London’s Heathrow Airport. The agreement
    has resulted in American facing increased competition in these
    markets, including Heathrow. In addition, an open skies air
    services agreement between the U.S. and Japan that provides
    airlines from the U.S. and Japan open access to each
    other’s markets took effect in November 2010.

We
    could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that
    affects travel behavior.

In the second quarter of 2009, there was an outbreak of the H1N1
    virus which had an adverse impact throughout our network but
    primarily on our operations to and from Mexico. In 2003, there
    was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),
    which had an adverse impact primarily on our Asia operations. In
    addition, in the past there have been concerns about outbreaks
    or potential outbreaks of other diseases, such as avian flu. Any
    outbreak of a disease (including an additional outbreak of the
    H1N1 virus) that affects travel behavior could have a material
    adverse impact on us. In addition, outbreaks of disease could
    result in quarantines of our personnel or an inability to access
    facilities or our aircraft, which could adversely affect our
    operations.

Our
    labor costs are higher than those of our
    competitors.

Wages, salaries and benefits constitute a significant percentage
    of our total operating expenses. In 2010, they constituted
    approximately 31 percent of our total operating expenses.
    All of the major

hub-and-spoke

carriers with whom American competes have achieved significant
    labor cost savings through or outside of bankruptcy proceedings.
    We believe American’s labor costs are higher than those of
    its primary competitors, and it is unclear


how long this labor cost disadvantage may persist. These higher
    labor costs may adversely affect our ability to achieve and
    sustain profitability while competing with other airlines with
    lower labor costs. Additionally, we cannot predict the outcome
    of our ongoing negotiations with our unionized work groups.
    Significant increases in pay and benefits resulting from changes
    to our collective bargaining agreements could have a material
    adverse effect on us.

We
    could be adversely affected if we are unable to have
    satisfactory relations with any unionized or other employee work
    group.

Our business is labor intensive. To the extent that we are
    unable to have satisfactory relations with any unionized or
    other employee work group, our operations and our ability to
    execute our strategic plans could be adversely affected. In
    addition, any disruption by an employee work group (e.g.,
    sick-out, slowdown, full or partial strike, or other job action)
    may materially adversely affect our operations and impair our
    financial performance.

In April 2003, American reached agreements (the “Labor
    Agreements”) with each of its three major unions, the APA,
    the TWU) and the APFA. The Labor Agreements substantially
    moderated the labor costs associated with the employees
    represented by the unions. In conjunction with the Labor
    Agreements, American also implemented various changes in the pay
    plans and benefits for non-unionized personnel. The Labor
    Agreements became amendable in 2008 (although the parties agreed
    that they could begin the negotiations process as early as
    2006). American has been in negotiations with the APA since
    September 20 2006, the TWU since May 11, 2006 (with respect
    to Dispatchers), and since November 7, 2007 (with respect
    to the other six groups at American represented by the TWU), and
    with the APFA since June 2008 (expedited negotiations) and
    September 10, 2008 (standard negotiations), to amend their
    respective Labor Agreements. At this time, all such negotiations
    are mediated negotiations under the auspices of the National
    Mediation Board (“NMB”). NMB mediation with the APA
    began on May 6, 2008, with the TWU (with respect to the
    Dispatchers) on October 28, 2008, with the other TWU groups
    on various dates in 2009, and with the APFA on January 22,
    2009. These negotiations are governed by the Railway Labor Act
    (“

RLA

”), which prescribes no set timetable for
    the negotiations and mediation process. The negotiations and
    mediation process in the airline industry typically is slow and
    sometimes contentious. The RLA prohibits the parties from
    engaging in self-help prior to the exhaustion of the RLA’s
    bargaining process. That process is not exhausted until the NMB
    has declared the parties are at a bargaining impasse, one or
    both parties has declined the NMB’s proffer of binding
    arbitration, and a

30-day

cooling off period has expired without the appointment of a
    Presidential Emergency Board. If we are unable to reach
    agreement with any of our unionized work groups, and the
    RLA’s bargaining process has been fully exhausted, we may
    be subject to lawful strikes, work stoppages or other job
    actions.

In May, 2010, American negotiated tentative agreements with
    several workgroups within the TWU, including the Maintenance
    Control Technician group, the Material Logistics Specialists
    group and the Mechanic and Related group. Agreements with the
    TWU groups are subject to ratification by the relevant
    membership of TWU, and, while the Maintenance Control Technician
    group ratified their agreement, the Material Logistics
    Specialists group and the Mechanic and Related group tentative
    agreements were not ratified.

Mediated negotiations with the APA, with the APFA and with the
    TWU with respect to groups other than the Maintenance Control
    Technician group continue. In addition, the APA has filed a
    number of grievances, lawsuits and complaints, most of which
    American believes are part of a corporate campaign related to
    the union’s labor agreement negotiations with American.
    While American is vigorously defending these disputes,
    unfavorable outcomes in one or more of them could require
    American to incur additional costs, change the way it conducts
    some parts of its business, or otherwise adversely affect us.

Increases
    in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have an
    adverse impact on us.

We carry insurance for public liability, passenger liability,
    property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to our
    aircraft. As a result of the Terrorist Attacks, aviation
    insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage
    available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons
    other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from
    acts of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At
    the same time, these insurers significantly increased the
    premiums for aviation insurance in general. While the price of
    commercial insurance has declined since the period immediately
    after the Terrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance
    carriers further


reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to us, or
    significantly increase its cost, we would be adversely affected.

The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial
    war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines through
    September 30, 2011, covering losses to employees,
    passengers, third parties and aircraft. If the
    U.S. government were to cease providing such insurance in
    whole or in part, it is likely that we could obtain comparable
    coverage in the commercial market, but we could incur
    substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if
    such coverage is available at all. If we are unable to obtain
    adequate war-risk coverage at commercially reasonable rates, we
    would be adversely affected.

We may
    be unable to retain key management personnel.

We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our
    key management employees, and there can be no assurance that we
    will be able to retain them. Any inability to retain our key
    management employees, or attract and retain additional qualified
    management employees, could have a negative impact on us.

We are
    increasingly dependent on technology and could be adversely
    affected by a failure or disruption of our computer,
    communications or other technology systems.

We are heavily and increasingly dependent on technology to
    operate our business, reduce our costs and enhance customer
    service. The computer and communications systems on which we
    rely could be disrupted due to various events, some of which are
    beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures,
    terrorist attacks, equipment failures, system implementation
    failures, software failures and computer viruses and hackers. We
    have taken certain steps to help reduce the risk of some (but
    not all) of these potential disruptions. There can be no
    assurance, however, that the measures we have taken are adequate
    to prevent or remedy disruptions or failures of these systems.
    Any substantial or repeated failure of these systems could
    impact our operations and customer service, result in the loss
    of important data, loss of revenues, and increased costs, and
    generally harm our business. Moreover, a failure of certain of
    our vital systems could limit our ability to operate our flights
    for an extended period of time, which would have a material
    adverse impact on our operations and our business. In addition,
    we will need to continue to make significant investments in
    technology to pursue initiatives to reduce costs and enhance
    customer service. If we are unable to make these investments,
    our business could be negatively impacted.

We are
    at risk of losses and adverse publicity which might result from
    an accident involving any of our aircraft.

If one of our aircraft were to be involved in an accident, we
    could be exposed to significant tort liability. The insurance we
    carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be
    inadequate. In the event that our insurance is not adequate, we
    may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In
    addition, any accident involving an aircraft operated by us
    could adversely affect the public’s perception of us.

Interruptions
    or disruptions in service at one or more of our primary market
    airports could have an adverse impact on us.

Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at our
    primary market airports in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Chicago,
    Miami, New York City and Los Angeles. Each of these operations
    includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets
    in the geographic region around the primary market to other
    major cities. A significant interruption or disruption in
    service at one or more of our primary markets could adversely
    impact our operations.

The
    airline industry is heavily taxed.

The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and
    taxation that negatively impact our revenue. The
    U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of
    all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in
    the past decade for domestic flights and various U.S. fees
    and taxes also are assessed on international flights. In
    addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we
    operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees
    and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number
    and amount in recent years. Certain of


these fees and taxes must be included in the fares we advertise
    or quote to our customers. Due to the competitive revenue
    environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been
    absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to
    the passenger. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce
    demand for air travel, and thus our revenues.

American leases all 39 Super ATR aircraft from a third party and
    in turn, subleases those aircraft to AMR Eagle for operation.

Substantially all of the Company’s aircraft leases include
    an option to purchase the aircraft or to extend the lease term,
    or both, with the purchase price or renewal rental to be based
    essentially on the market value of the aircraft at the end of
    the term of the lease or at a predetermined fixed amount.

Ground
    Properties

The Company leases or has built as leasehold improvements on
    leased property: most of its airport and terminal facilities in
    the U.S. and overseas; its training facilities in
    Fort Worth, Texas; its principal overhaul and maintenance
    bases at Tulsa International Airport (Tulsa, Oklahoma) and
    Alliance Airport (Fort Worth, Texas); its regional
    reservation offices; and local ticket and administration offices
    throughout the system. In November 2010,


AMR closed its Kansas City overhaul and maintenance base. The
    Company owns its headquarters building in Fort Worth,
    Texas. American has entered into agreements with the Tulsa
    Municipal Airport Trust; the Alliance Airport Authority,
    Fort Worth, Texas; the New York City Industrial Development
    Agency; and the Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O’Hare,
    Newark, San Juan, and Los Angeles airport authorities to
    provide funds for the cost of constructing, improving and
    modifying facilities and acquiring equipment which are or will
    be leased to the Company. The Company also uses public airports
    for its flight operations under lease or use arrangements with
    the municipalities or governmental agencies owning or
    controlling them and leases certain other ground equipment for
    use at its facilities.

For information concerning the estimated lives and residual
    values for owned ground properties, lease terms and amortization

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

On February 14, 2006, the Antitrust Division of the United
    States Department of Justice (DOJ) served the Company with a
    grand jury subpoena as part of an ongoing investigation into
    possible criminal violations of the antitrust laws by certain
    domestic and foreign air cargo carriers. At this time, the
    Company does not believe it is a target of the DOJ
    investigation. The New Zealand Commerce Commission notified the
    Company on February 17, 2006 that it is investigating
    whether the Company and certain other cargo carriers entered
    into agreements relating to fuel surcharges, security
    surcharges, war-risk surcharges, and customs clearance
    surcharges. On February 22, 2006, the Company received a
    letter from the Swiss Competition Commission informing the
    Company that it is investigating whether the Company and certain
    other cargo carriers entered into agreements relating to fuel
    surcharges, security surcharges, war-risk surcharges, and
    customs clearance surcharges. On March 11, 2008, the
    Company received a request for information from the Swiss
    Competition Commission concerning, among other things, the scope
    and organization of the Company’s activities in
    Switzerland. On June 27, 2007 and October 31, 2007,
    the Company received requests for information from the
    Australian Competition and Consumer Commission seeking
    information regarding fuel surcharges imposed by the Company on
    cargo shipments to and from Australia and regarding the
    structure of the Company’s cargo operations. On
    September 1, 2008, the Company received a request from the
    Korea Fair Trade Commission seeking information regarding cargo
    rates and surcharges and the structure of the Company’s
    activities in Korea. On January 23, 2007, the Brazilian
    competition authorities, as part of an ongoing investigation,
    conducted an unannounced search of the Company’s cargo
    facilities in Sao Paulo, Brazil. On April 24, 2008, the
    Brazilian competition authorities charged the Company with
    violating Brazilian competition laws. On December 31, 2009,
    the Brazilian competition authorities made a non-binding
    recommendation to the Brazilian competition tribunal that it
    find the Company in violation of competition laws. The
    authorities are investigating whether the Company and certain
    other foreign and domestic air carriers violated Brazilian
    competition laws by illegally conspiring to set fuel surcharges
    on cargo shipments. The Company is vigorously contesting the
    allegations and the preliminary findings of the Brazilian
    competition authorities. On December 19, 2006 and
    June 12, 2007, the Company received requests for
    information from the European Commission seeking information
    regarding the Company’s corporate structure, and revenue
    and pricing announcements for air cargo shipments to and from
    the European Union. On December 18, 2007, the European
    Commission issued a Statement of Objection (SO) against 26
    airlines, including the Company. The SO alleges that these
    carriers participated in a conspiracy to set surcharges on cargo
    shipments in violation of EU law. On November 12, 2010, the
    EU Commission notified the Company that it was closing its
    proceedings against the Company without imposing any fine or
    finding any wrongdoing. The Company intends to cooperate fully
    with all pending investigations. In the event that any
    investigations uncover violations of the U.S. antitrust
    laws or the competition laws of some other jurisdiction, or if
    the Company were named and found liable in any litigation based
    on these allegations, such findings and related legal
    proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
    Forty-five purported class action lawsuits have been filed in
    the U.S. against the Company and certain foreign and
    domestic air carriers alleging that the defendants violated
    U.S. antitrust laws by illegally conspiring to set prices
    and surcharges on cargo shipments. These cases, along with other
    purported class action lawsuits in which the Company was not
    named, were consolidated in the United States District Court for
    the Eastern District of New York as

In re Air Cargo Shipping
    Services Antitrust Litigation

, 06-MD-1775 on June 20,
    2006. Plaintiffs are seeking trebled money damages and
    injunctive relief. To facilitate a settlement on a class basis,
    the company agreed to be named in a


separate class action complaint, which was filed on
    July 26, 2010. The settlement of that complaint, in which
    the company does not admit and denies liability, was given
    preliminary approval by the court on September 8, 2010. The
    settlement has not yet received final approval, and some members
    of the class have elected to opt out, thereby preserving their
    rights to sue the Company separately. Any adverse judgment could
    have a material adverse impact on the Company. Also, on
    January 23, 2007, the Company was served with a purported
    class action complaint filed against the Company, American, and
    certain foreign and domestic air carriers in the Supreme Court
    of British Columbia in Canada (

McKay v. Ace Aviation
    Holdings, et al.

). The plaintiff alleges that the defendants
    violated Canadian competition laws by illegally conspiring to
    set prices and surcharges on cargo shipments. The complaint
    seeks compensatory and punitive damages under Canadian law. On
    June 22, 2007, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their
    claims against the Company. The dismissal is without prejudice
    and the Company could be brought back into the litigation at a
    future date. If litigation is recommenced against the Company in
    the Canadian courts, the Company will vigorously defend itself;
    however, any adverse judgment could have a material adverse
    impact on the Company.

On June 20, 2006, DOJ served the Company with a grand jury
    subpoena as part of an ongoing investigation into possible
    criminal violations of the antitrust laws by certain domestic
    and foreign passenger carriers. At this time, the Company does
    not believe it is a target of the DOJ investigation. The Company
    intends to cooperate fully with this investigation. On
    September 4, 2007, the Attorney General of the State of
    Florida served the Company with a Civil Investigative Demand as
    part of its investigation of possible violations of federal and
    Florida antitrust laws regarding the pricing of air passenger
    transportation. In the event that this or other investigations
    uncover violations of the U.S. antitrust laws or the
    competition laws of some other jurisdiction, such findings and
    related legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact
    on the Company. Approximately 52 purported class action lawsuits
    have been filed in the U.S. against the Company and certain
    foreign and domestic air carriers alleging that the defendants
    violated U.S. antitrust laws by illegally conspiring to set
    prices and surcharges for passenger transportation. On
    October 25, 2006, these cases, along with other purported
    class action lawsuits in which the Company was not named, were
    consolidated in the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of California as

In re International Air
    Transportation Surcharge Antitrust Litigation

, Civ.

No. 06-1793

(the Passenger MDL). On July 9, 2007, the Company was named
    as a defendant in the Passenger MDL. On August 25, 2008,
    the plaintiffs dismissed their claims against the Company in
    this action. On March 13, 2008, and March 14, 2008, an
    additional purported class action complaint, Turner v.
    American Airlines, et al., Civ.

No. 08-1444

(N.D. Cal.), was filed against the Company, alleging that the
    Company violated U.S. antitrust laws by illegally
    conspiring to set prices and surcharges for passenger
    transportation in Japan and certain European countries,
    respectively. The Turner plaintiffs have failed to perfect
    service against the Company, and it is unclear whether they
    intend to pursue their claims. In the event that the Turner
    plaintiffs pursue their claims, the Company will vigorously
    defend these lawsuits, but any adverse judgment in these actions
    could have a material adverse impact on the Company.

On August 21, 2006, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed
    against American and American Beacon Advisors, Inc. (then a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) in the United States
    District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (

Ronald A.
    Katz Technology Licensing, L.P. v. American Airlines, Inc.,
    et al.

). This case has been consolidated in the Central
    District of California for pre-trial purposes with numerous
    other cases brought by the plaintiff against other defendants.
    The plaintiff alleges that American infringes a number of the
    plaintiff’s patents, each of which relates to automated
    telephone call processing systems. The plaintiff is seeking past
    and future royalties, injunctive relief, costs and
    attorneys’ fees. On December 1, 2008, the court
    dismissed with prejudice all claims against American Beacon. On
    May 22, 2009, following its granting of summary judgment to
    American based on invalidity and non-infringement, the court
    dismissed all claims against American. Plaintiff filed a notice
    of appeal on June 22, 2009 with respect to the court’s
    ruling for American. Although the Company believes that the
    plaintiff’s claims are without merit and is vigorously
    defending the lawsuit, a final adverse court decision awarding
    substantial money damages or placing material restrictions on
    existing automated telephone call system operations would have a
    material adverse impact on the Company.

On January 5, 2010, Sabre notified the Company that it was
    immediately introducing bias against the display of
    American’s services in its global distribution system
    (GDS), as well as substantially increasing the rates that it
    would charge the Company for bookings made through the Sabre
    GDS. Sabre contended that its agreement with the Company
    permitted it to take these actions. On January 10, 2010,
    the Company filed a lawsuit in Tarrant County,


Texas State Court against Sabre alleging, among other claims,
    that Sabre’s actions breached its agreement with the
    Company. That same day, the Company successfully obtained a
    temporary restraining order that prohibited Sabre from
    continuing to bias the display of American’s services. On
    January 23, 2010, the Company and Sabre entered into a
    Stand-Down Agreement, pursuant to which American agreed to
    suspend the litigation against Sabre, and Sabre agreed not to
    reintroduce biasing against American’s services in its GDS
    and to return to the pricing in effect on January 4, 2010.
    The parties further agreed to enter into good faith
    negotiations. The Stand-Down Agreement will remain in effect
    until June 1, 2010. In the event that the Stand Down
    Agreement expires without a new agreement with Sabre, and the
    Court does not further enjoin Sabre from introducing bias
    against American’s services, actions taken by Sabre could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking
    Information

The discussions under Business, Risk Factors, Properties and
    Legal Proceedings, and the following discussions under
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” and “Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” contain
    various forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, which represent the Company’s expectations or
    beliefs concerning future events. When used in this document and
    in documents incorporated herein by reference, the words
    “expects,” “estimates,” “plans,”
    “anticipates,” “indicates,”
    “believes,” “forecast,”
    “guidance,” “outlook,” “may,”
    “will,” “should,” “seeks,”
    “targets” and similar expressions are intended to
    identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, statements that
    describe the Company’s objectives, plans or goals, or
    actions the Company may take in the future, are forward-looking
    statements. Forward-looking statements include, without
    limitation, the Company’s expectations concerning
    operations and financial conditions, including changes in
    capacity, revenues, and costs; future financing plans and needs;
    the amounts of its unencumbered assets and other sources of
    liquidity; fleet plans; overall economic and industry
    conditions; plans and objectives for future operations;
    regulatory approvals and actions; and the impact on the Company
    of its results of operations in recent years and the sufficiency
    of its financial resources to absorb that impact. Other
    forward-looking statements include statements which do not
    relate solely to historical facts, such as, without limitation,
    statements which discuss the possible future effects of current
    known trends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future
    effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted,
    guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking statements in this
    report are based upon information available to the Company on
    the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to
    publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether
    as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
    Guidance given in this report regarding capacity, fuel
    consumption, fuel prices, fuel hedging and unit costs are
    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are
    subject to a number of factors that could cause the
    Company’s actual results to differ materially from the
    Company’s expectations. The Risk Factors listed in
    Item 1A could cause the Company’s actual results to
    differ materially from historical results and from those
    expressed in forward-looking statements.

Recent
    Events

In late 2009, the Company unveiled a new business
    plan — FlightPlan 2020, which is an evolution of the
    Turnaround Plan that guided the Company through the last decade.
    FlightPlan 2020 is a strategic framework developed to secure the
    Company’s future by focusing on what will be required to
    succeed in the airline business over the next decade. It
    establishes the Company’s priorities and a clear plan to
    better position the Company to meet the challenges of the coming
    years. This plan for achieving sustained profitability has five
    tenets: (i) Invest Wisely, (ii) Earn Customer Loyalty,
    (iii) Strengthen and Defend our Global Network,
    (iv) Be a Good Place for Good People and (v) Fly
    Profitably. All strategic actions by the Company going forward
    are expected to be designed to realize the goals of FlightPlan
    2020.

Under FlightPlan 2020, the Company has launched its network
    strategy that focuses resources in its cornerstone markets of
    Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago O’Hare, Miami, New
    York City and Los Angeles, and has continued to execute its
    fleet renewal and replacement plan. Further, the Company
    continues to pursue its strategy to form cooperative agreements
    with

one

world members and other airlines.

In 2008, American entered into a joint business agreement (JBA)
    and related marketing arrangements with British Airways and
    Iberia. These agreements provide for commercial cooperation on
    flights between North America and most countries in Europe,
    pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, expanded
    codesharing, enhanced frequent flyer program reciprocity, and
    cooperation in other areas.

In July 2010, American obtained clearance from the European
    Commission (EC) and approval by the Department of Transportation
    (DOT) for antitrust immunity (ATI) for its planned cooperation
    with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair and Royal Jordanian.
    Regulatory conditions for ATI approval for the British Airways,
    Iberia, Finnair and Royal Jordanian cooperative agreement
    include a collective obligation of the Company, British Airways,
    and


Iberia to lease to other carriers up to seven takeoff and
    landing slot pairs at London Heathrow airport and up to three
    John F. Kennedy airport operational authorities, depending on
    market conditions. American began implementation of the JBA with
    British Airways and Iberia and expanded cooperation with Finnair
    and Royal Jordanian in October 2010. No assurances can be given
    as to any arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any
    benefits that we may derive from such arrangements.

In February 2010, American and JAL announced the decision to
    strengthen their relationship. The carriers, entered into a JBA
    which will enhance their scope of cooperation on routes between
    North America and Asia through adjustments to their respective
    networks, flight schedules, and other business activities. This,
    in turn, will allow both carriers to better complement each
    other’s operations and to develop and offer competitive
    products and quality service to their customers.

As a part of these commercial benefits, American determined that
    with ATI and by participating in a joint business agreement with
    American, JAL could realize approximately $100 million in
    annual incremental revenue. American has given JAL a guarantee
    to that effect covering the first three years following
    implementation of the joint business agreement, subject to
    certain terms and conditions. At this time, the amount (if any)
    that AMR may ultimately owe under the agreement is unclear. The
    Company and other

one

world members have also discussed
    various possible financing arrangements with JAL. The Company
    has agreed to negotiate in good faith towards a capital
    investment in JAL by American,

one

world and a private
    investment firm in the future if invited by JAL and the
    Government of Japan. To date, the Government of Japan has
    declined any such investment, and the Company does not expect
    that any such investment will be made in the near term. Any such
    investment would be on and subject to terms and conditions
    customary to such an arrangement. The Company also expects that
    the amount of such a capital investment, if any, by American and
    other

one

world carriers, would not exceed
    $300 million, with additional investment from private
    partners.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, American and JAL received
    approval for ATI on certain routes between North America
    and Asia from the DOT and MLIT. Implementation of the JBA is
    subject to successful negotiation of certain detailed financial
    and commercial arrangements and other approvals. American
    expects to begin implementing the JBA with JAL in 2011. No
    assurances can be given as to any arrangements that may
    ultimately be implemented or any benefits that the Company may
    derive from such arrangements.

In 2010, American also commenced commercial collaboration in New
    York and Boston with JetBlue. American’s agreement with
    JetBlue provides customers with interline service in
    non-overlapping markets, letting customers connect between 15 of
    American’s international destinations from New York and
    Boston and 26 domestic cities flown by JetBlue. Further,
    American expanded its relationship with JetBlue so that
    AAdvantage members and members of JetBlue’s customer
    loyalty program will be able to earn AAdvantage miles or JetBlue
    points, respectively, when they fly on American and JetBlue
    cooperative interline routes. Under the terms of the agreements
    for commercial collaboration, American transferred eight slot
    pairs at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C.
    (which were owned by American) and one slot pair at White
    Plains, New York (which were owned by AMR Eagle) to JetBlue, and
    JetBlue transferred twelve slot pairs at JFK to American. The
    reciprocal frequent flyer earning benefits and slot transfers
    became effective in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Further in 2010, the Company announced that it plans to extend
    its network through new commercial collaboration agreements with
    several airlines, including Air Berlin, Europe’s fifth
    largest airline, GOL Airlines of Brazil, Jetstar Airways, which
    is an affiliate airline of Qantas Airways (a

one

world
    alliance member), and Canada’s WestJet. These agreements
    include both interline and codeshare arrangements that allow
    customers of the Company and the respective airline to book and
    travel on the other’s network. Selected agreements are
    subject to regulatory approval and no assurances can be given as
    to any arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any
    benefits that the Company may derive from such arrangements.

The Company currently estimates that the implementation of its
    cornerstone strategy, the implementation of the Company’s
    JBA with British Airways/Iberia and proposed cooperation with
    JAL, and various other alliance and network activities will
    result in incremental revenues and cost savings of over
    $500 million per year. The Company expects that it will
    realize the majority of these incremental revenues and cost
    savings in 2011, and the remainder by year end 2012. This
    estimate is based on a number of assumptions that are inherently
    uncertain, and the Company’s ability to realize these
    benefits depends on various factors, some of which are beyond
    the Company’s control, such


as factors referred to above in “Forward-Looking
    Information.” No assurances can be given as to any benefits
    the Company may derive from such arrangements.

The Company is in active labor contract negotiations with each
    of its organized labor groups. The Company negotiated tentative
    agreements with several workgroups within the Transport Workers
    Union of American

AFL-CIO

(TWU) including the Maintenance Control Technician group, the
    Material Logistics Specialists group and the Mechanic and
    Related group. Agreements with the TWU groups are subject to
    ratification by the relevant membership of TWU, and while the
    Maintenance Control Technician group ratified their agreement,
    the Material Logistics Specialists group and the Mechanic and
    Related group tentative agreements were not ratified. Mediated
    negotiation continues under the auspices of the National
    Mediation Board with the TWU, the Allied Pilots Association
    (APA) and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants
    (APFA).

Based on analysis of airline industry labor contracts, the
    Company currently estimates that American’s labor cost
    disadvantage (the amount by which its labor costs exceed what
    such costs would be if they were determined based on the average
    of other network carrier labor contracts) is approximately
    $600 million per year. The Company expects this gap to
    narrow as open industry labor contracts are settled. This
    expectation is based on a number of assumptions. The airline
    industry labor contract negotiation process is inherently
    uncertain and the results of labor contract negotiations are
    difficult to predict.

In June 2010, AMR reiterated its intent to evaluate the possible
    divestiture of AMR Eagle, its wholly-owned regional carrier. The
    AMR Eagle fleet is operated to feed passenger traffic to
    American pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement between
    American and AMR Eagle under which American receives all
    passenger revenue from AMR Eagle flights and pays AMR Eagle a
    fee for each flight. The capacity purchase agreement reflects
    what AMR believes are current market rates received by other
    regional carriers for similar flying. Amounts paid to AMR Eagle
    under the capacity purchase agreement are available to pay for
    various operating expenses of AMR Eagle, such as crew expenses,
    maintenance, aircraft ownership (including the debt service on
    the loans made to finance the AMR Eagle fleet of jet aircraft),
    and aircraft lease payments for the AMR Eagle fleet of turboprop
    aircraft. AMR continues to evaluate both the desirability and
    the form of such a divestiture, which may include a spin-off to
    AMR shareholders, a sale to a third party, or some other form of
    separation. Any divestiture of AMR Eagle could involve the
    restructuring of some or all of AMR Eagle’s assets and
    liabilities, and the assumption of certain of AMR Eagle’s
    liabilities by American. If AMR were to decide to pursue a
    divestiture of AMR Eagle, no prediction can be made as to
    whether any such divestiture would be completed, and the
    completion of any divestiture transaction and its timing would
    depend upon a number of factors, including general economic,
    industry and financial market conditions, as well as the
    ultimate form and structure of the divestiture. In addition, no
    prediction can be made as to the potential impacts on AMR or
    American of any divestiture of AMR Eagle due to, among others,
    uncertainties regarding the form and structure of any
    divestiture, the potential restructuring of assets and
    liabilities, and the nature and scope of any resulting
    amendments to the capacity purchase agreement between American
    and AMR Eagle.

During 2010, Congress passed and the President signed new
    healthcare legislation. While the new law did and will continue
    to impact certain of our active employee healthcare plans,
    according to recently released interim final regulations
    promulgated under the legislation, the Company’s retiree
    medical benefits will be exempt from many of the mandates of the
    legislation. Thus, we currently believe this impact will not be
    material. We will continue to review the impact of the new law
    as governmental agencies issue interpretations regarding its
    meaning and scope. Also in 2010, the President signed the
    Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which
    could impact the Company, but those effects cannot be predicted
    at this time as the related rules and regulations have not been
    finalized.

Contingencies

The Company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation
    and claims incident to the ordinary course of business.
    Management believes, after considering a number of factors,
    including (but not limited to) the information currently
    available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of
    contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior
    experience, that the ultimate disposition of the litigation
    (except as noted in “Legal Proceedings” in
    item 3) and claims will not materially affect the
    Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations. When appropriate, the Company accrues for these
    contingencies based on its assessments of the likely outcomes of
    the


related matters. The amounts of these contingencies could
    increase or decrease in the near term, based on revisions to
    those assessments.

The Company files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws
    of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company’s
    2004 through 2009 tax years are still subject to examination by
    the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign
    jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination, and the
    Company is under examination, in administrative appeals, or
    engaged in tax litigation in certain jurisdictions. See Income
    Taxes under “Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates” under Item 7.

On August 26, 2010, the Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA) proposed a $24.2 million civil penalty against
    American, claiming that American failed to properly perform
    certain portions of an FAA Airworthiness Directive concerning
    certain wiring to the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft auxiliary
    hydraulic pump. American plans to challenge the proposed civil
    penalty. The Company has concluded that the amount of the
    penalty, if any, that may be paid is not estimable at
    December 31, 2010.

GDS
    Discussion

Over the past several years, American has been developing a
    direct connection technology, designed to distribute its fare
    content and bookings capability directly to travel agents in
    order to achieve greater efficiencies, cost savings, and
    technological advances in the distribution of our services.
    Historically, approximately 60% of American’s bookings are
    booked through travel agencies, which typically use one or more
    global distribution systems, or “GDSs”, to view fare
    content from American and other industry participants. American
    is currently in litigation with two of the GDSs, Sabre and
    Travelport, and is in business discussions with two large online
    travel agencies, Orbitz and Expedia, related to American’s
    efforts to implement its direct connection technology.

On November 5, 2010, Travelport, the GDS used by Orbitz,
    filed a lawsuit against American seeking a ruling that a notice
    of termination delivered by American to Orbitz breached
    American’s content distribution agreement with Travelport.
    Subsequently, on December 2, 2010, Travelport doubled the
    booking fees it charges American for some international

point-of-sale

bookings through Travelport, and made it more difficult for
    travel agents to find American’s fares on the Travelport
    system display. We believe these actions violate our agreement
    with Travelport. In response, American filed counterclaims
    against Travelport for breach of contract, and implemented a
    charge on bookings through Travelport in an effort to offset the
    booking fee increase. There can be no assurance that we will be
    successful in offsetting this expense completely, or that we
    will ultimately prevail in the lawsuit filed by Travelport or on
    our counterclaims. We are vigorously pursuing our counterclaims
    and rights in the litigation, as well as engaged in active
    negotiations with Travelport to resolve the lawsuit and our
    counterclaims.

On December 21, 2010, American terminated its agreement
    with Orbitz. Prior to termination of such agreement,
    approximately 3% of American’s passenger revenue, on an
    annualized basis, was generated from bookings made via Orbitz.
    We are engaged in active negotiations with Orbitz to enter into
    a new agreement.

On December 31, 2010, American’s agreement with
    Expedia expired, and Expedia discontinued selling American
    tickets on its website. Prior to expiration of that agreement,
    approximately 5.4% of American’s passenger revenue, on an
    annualized basis, was booked through Expedia. We are engaged in
    active negotiations with Expedia to enter into a new agreement.

On January 5, 2011, Sabre made it more difficult for travel
    agents to find American’s fares on the Sabre system display
    and doubled the fees it charges American for bookings through
    its GDS. Sabre also terminated portions of its GDS agreements
    with American, effective July 2011. This termination, if valid,
    would entitle Sabre to make it more difficult for travel agents
    to find American’s fares through its GDS and materially
    increase the fees it charges American for bookings through its
    GDS, as well as allowing Sabre to terminate its GDS agreements
    with American entirely in August 2011. Sabre alleges that our
    contract allowed it to take these actions in response to
    statements that American made in the press concerning our direct
    connection technology. Sabre is the largest non-direct source of
    American’s bookings. In 2010, over $7 billion of
    American’s passenger revenues were generated from bookings
    made through the Sabre GDS. In response to Sabre’s actions,
    on January 10, 2011, American filed a lawsuit against Sabre
    in Texas state court on several grounds. The court temporarily
    enjoined Sabre from “biasing” or making it more
    difficult to find American’s fares on the Sabre GDS, and
    set a preliminary injunction hearing for February 14,


2011. On January 23, 2011, American and Sabre entered into
    a Stand Down Agreement that suspended the litigation until
    June 1, 2011 and vacated the February 14 hearing date.
    During this period, Sabre agreed (1) not to take any
    actions to bias the display of American’s services;
    (2) to return to the pricing in effect on January 4,
    2011; and (3) withdraw its notice of termination of certain
    parts of the agreement. We can give no assurances that we will
    resolve our disputes with Sabre or prevail in a temporary
    injunction hearing should such a hearing become necessary after
    the Stand Down Agreement with Sabre expires on June 1,
    2011. The failure to resolve these issues or prevail in a
    subsequent hearing could have a material adverse impact on our
    level of bookings, business and results of operations.

While we believe that some of the bookings through Orbitz,
    Travelport, Expedia and Sabre have transitioned or will
    transition to other distribution channels, such as other travel
    agencies, metasearch sites and American’s AA.com web site,
    it is not possible at this time to estimate what the ultimate
    impact would be to our business if we are unsuccessful in
    resolving one or more of these matters. If as a result of these
    matters it becomes more difficult for our customers to find and
    book flights on American, we could be put at a competitive
    disadvantage against our competitors and this may result in
    lower bookings. If we are unable to sell American inventory
    through any or all of these channels, our level of bookings,
    business and results of operations could be materially adversely
    affected. We also believe the actions taken by Travelport and
    Sabre described above are not permitted by the applicable
    contracts. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims and
    defenses in the lawsuits described above, but there can be no
    assurance of the outcome of any such lawsuit.

Financial
    Highlights

The Company recorded a net loss of $471 million in 2010
    compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion in 2009. The
    Company’s smaller net loss in 2010 reflects an improvement
    in a weak global economy; which led to higher passenger
    revenues, partially offset by higher fuel prices. Mainline
    passenger revenue increased by $1.7 billion to
    $16.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to 2009. Mainline passenger unit revenues increased
    10.4 percent in 2010 due to an 8.7 percent increase in
    passenger yield compared to 2009 and a load factor increase of
    approximately 1.2 points. Passenger yield remains below the
    Company’s peak yield set in the year 2000, despite
    cumulative inflation of approximately 27 percent over the
    same time frame. The Company believes this is the result of a
    fragmented industry with numerous competitors and excess
    capacity, increased low cost carrier competition, increased
    price competition due to the internet, and other factors. Since
    deregulation in 1978, the Company’s passenger yield has
    increased 78 percent, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI),
    as measured by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor
    Statistics, has grown by over 225 percent. The Company
    believes increases in passenger yield will continue to
    significantly lag CPI indefinitely.

The increase in total passenger revenue was partially offset by
    significantly higher

year-over-year

fuel prices. Fuel expense, taking into account the impact of
    fuel hedging, increased by $847 million to
    $6.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to 2009. Hedging losses accounted for approximately
    $142 million of the overall increase in fuel expense. The
    Company paid an average of $2.32 per gallon in 2010 compared to
    an average of $2.01 per gallon in 2009, including effects of
    hedging. Although fuel prices have abated considerably from the
    record high prices recorded in July 2008, they have increased
    since the first quarter of 2009, particularly recently, and
    remain high and extremely volatile by historical standards. In
    addition, the Company’s unit costs, excluding fuel and
    special charges, were greater for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 than for the same period in 2009. Factors
    driving the increase include revenue related costs, such as
    credit card fees and booking fees and commissions, and higher
    aircraft rent related to the Company’s fleet renewal plan.
    The Company remains focused on cost reductions, but expects such
    factors to result in continuing cost pressures in 2011.

In addition, the Company’s 2010 results were negatively
    impacted by a net amount of $81 million in special items
    related to the Venezuelan currency remeasurement in January 2010
    and a non-cash impairment charge to write down certain routes
    and slot authorities in Latin America as a result of open skies
    agreements. Comparatively, the Company’s 2009 operating
    results were negatively impacted by a net amount of
    $107 million in special items, restructuring charges and a
    non-cash tax item, including $184 million from the
    impairment of certain route and slot authorities, primarily in
    Latin America, and losses on certain sale leaseback
    transactions. Restructuring charges for 2009 were
    $171 million and related to announced capacity reductions,
    including the grounding of the Airbus A300 fleet and the
    impairment of certain Embraer RJ-135 aircraft. Also included in
    2009 results is a $248 million non-


cash tax benefit resulting from the allocation of the tax
    expense to other comprehensive income items recognized during
    2009. The 2009 restructuring charges, the 2009 non-cash tax item
    and the 2010 and 2009 route impairments are described in
    Notes 2, 8 and 11, respectively, to the consolidated
    financial statements.

The Company’s ability to become profitable and its ability
    to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis will
    depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely beyond
    the Company’s control. Certain risk factors that affect the
    Company’s business and financial results are discussed in
    the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A.

In order to remain competitive and to improve its financial
    condition, the Company must continue to take steps to generate
    additional revenues and to reduce its costs. Although the
    Company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost
    and revenue challenges, some of these initiatives involve
    changes to the Company’s business which it may be unable to
    implement. It has become increasingly difficult to identify and
    implement significant revenue enhancement and cost savings
    initiatives. The adequacy and ultimate success of the
    Company’s initiatives to generate additional revenues and
    reduce costs cannot be assured. Moreover, whether the
    Company’s initiatives will be adequate or successful
    depends in large measure on factors beyond its control, notably
    the overall industry environment, including passenger demand,
    yield and industry capacity growth, and fuel prices. It will be
    very difficult for the Company to continue to fund its
    obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability,
    if the overall industry revenue environment does not continue to
    improve or if fuel prices were to increase and persist for an
    extended period at high levels.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted
    Assets

At December 31, 2010, the Company had
    $4.5 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term
    investments and $450 million in Restricted cash and
    short-term investments, both at fair value, versus
    $4.4 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term
    investments and $460 million in Restricted cash and
    short-term investments in 2009.

The Company’s unrestricted short-term investment portfolio
    consist of a variety of what the Company believes are highly
    liquid, low risk instruments including money market funds,
    government agency investments, repurchase investments,
    short-term obligations, corporate obligations, bank notes,
    certificates of deposit and time deposits. AMR’s objectives
    for its investment portfolio are (1) the safety of
    principal, (2) liquidity maintenance, (3) yield
    maximization, and (4) the full investment of all available
    funds. The Company’s risk management policy further
    emphasizes superior credit quality (primarily based on
    short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating
    organizations) in selecting and maintaining investments in its
    portfolio and enforces limits on the proportion of funds
    invested with one issuer, one industry, or one type of
    instrument. The Company regularly assesses the market risks of
    its portfolio, and believes that its established policies and
    business practices adequately limit those risks. As a result,
    the Company does not anticipate any material adverse impact from
    these risks.

Significant Indebtedness and Future
    Financing

Indebtedness is a significant risk to
    the Company as discussed in the Risk Factors listed in
    Item 1A. During the last five years, the Company raised an
    aggregate of approximately $8.8 billion in financing to
    fund operating losses, capital commitments (mainly for aircraft
    and ground properties), debt maturities, employee pension
    obligations and to bolster its liquidity. As of the date of this

Form 10-K,

the Company believes that it should have sufficient liquidity to
    fund its operations, including repayment of debt and capital
    leases, capital expenditures and other contractual obligations;
    however, there can be no assurances to that effect.

In addition, the Company has financing commitments covering all
    aircraft scheduled to be delivered to the Company in 2011 and
    2012, except for the two Boeing

777-300ER

aircraft recently ordered. Such financing commitments are
    subject to certain terms and conditions, including in some
    instances a condition that the Company have at least a certain
    minimum amount of liquidity.

In 2011, the Company will be required to make approximately
    $2.4 billion of principal payments on long-term debt and
    approximately $100 million in principal payments on capital
    leases, and the Company expects to spend approximately
    $1.6 billion on capital expenditures, including aircraft
    commitments. In addition, the fragile economy, rising fuel
    prices, the possibility of being required to post reserves under
    credit card processing


agreements, and the obligation to post cash collateral on fuel
    hedging contracts and fund pension plan contributions, among
    other things, may in the future negatively impact the
    Company’s liquidity. To maintain sufficient liquidity, and
    because the Company has significant debt, lease and other
    obligations in the next several years, including commitments to
    purchase aircraft, as well as significant pension funding
    obligations (refer to “Contractual Obligations” in
    Item 7), the Company will need access to substantial
    additional funding. An inability to obtain necessary additional
    funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact
    on the Company and on its ability to sustain its operations.

On January 25, 2011, American closed on a $657 million
    offering of Class A and Class B Pass Through
    Trust Certificates (the Certificates). The equipment notes
    expected to be held by each pass through trust will be issued
    for each of (a) 15 Boeing

737-823

aircraft delivered new to American from 1999 to 2001,
    (b) six Boeing

757-223

aircraft delivered new to American in 1999 and 2001,
    (c) two Boeing

767-323ER

aircraft delivered new to American in 1999 and (d) seven
    Boeing

777-223ER

aircraft delivered new to American from 1999 to 2000. At
    closing, 27 of the aircraft were encumbered by either private
    mortgages or by liens to secure debt incurred in connection with
    the issuance of enhanced equipment trust certificates in 2001,
    all of which mature in 2011. As a result, the proceeds from the
    sale of the Certificates of each trust will initially be held in
    escrow with a depositary, pending the financing of each aircraft
    under an indenture relating to the Certificates. Interest of
    5.25% and 7.00% per annum on the issued and outstanding
    Series A equipment notes and Series B equipment notes,
    respectively, will be payable semiannually on January 31 and
    July 31 of each year, commencing on July 31, 2011, and
    principal on such equipment notes is scheduled for payment on
    January 31 and July 31 of certain years, commencing on
    July 31, 2011. The payment obligations of American under
    the equipment notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed
    by AMR Corporation.

The Company’s substantial indebtedness and other
    obligations have important consequences. For example, they:
    (i) limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional
    funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
    investments and general corporate purposes, as well as adversely
    affect the terms on which such funding could be obtained;
    (ii) require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion
    of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness
    and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for
    other purposes; (iii) make the Company more vulnerable to
    economic downturns and catastrophic external events; and
    (iv) limit the Company’s ability to withstand
    competitive pressures and reduce its flexibility in responding
    to changing business and economic conditions.

The Company’s possible remaining financing sources
    primarily include: (i) a very limited amount of additional
    secured aircraft debt or sale leaseback transactions involving
    owned aircraft; (ii) debt secured by other assets;
    (iii) securitization of future operating receipts;
    (iv) the sale or monetization of certain assets;
    (v) unsecured debt; and (vi) issuance of equity or
    equity-like securities. Besides unencumbered aircraft, the
    Company’s most likely sources of liquidity include the
    financing of route authorities, takeoff and landing slots, spare
    parts, and the sale or financing of certain of AMR’s
    business units and subsidiaries, such as AMR Eagle. The
    Company’s ability to obtain future financing is limited by
    the value of its unencumbered assets. Almost all of the
    Company’s aircraft assets (including aircraft eligible for
    the benefits of Section 1110 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Code) are encumbered. Also, the market value of these aircraft
    assets has declined in recent years, and may continue to
    decline. The Company believes it has at least $2 billion in
    assets that could be used as possible financing sources as of
    the date of this filing. However, many of these assets may be
    difficult to finance, and the availability and level of the
    financing sources described above cannot be assured. The Company
    also believes it has the ability to refinance aircraft as those
    aircraft become unencumbered.

In July 2010, the Company entered into an amendment to Purchase
    Agreement No. 1977 with The Boeing Company (Boeing) to
    exercise rights to acquire additional Boeing

737-800

aircraft. Pursuant to the amendment, American exercised rights
    to purchase 35 Boeing

737-800

aircraft for delivery in 2011 and 2012. In conjunction with this
    transaction, American has arranged for backstop financing of the
    additional Boeing

737-800

aircraft deliveries, subject to certain terms and conditions.

As of December 31, 2010, American had 15 Boeing

737-800

purchase commitments for 2011 and 28 Boeing

737-800

purchase commitments in 2012 and in addition to those
    commitments, American had firm commitments for eleven Boeing

737-800

aircraft and seven Boeing

777-200

aircraft scheduled to be delivered in

2013-2016.


AMR Eagle has firm commitments for 8 Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft
    scheduled to be delivered in 2011. Payments for the
    Company’s aircraft purchase commitments will approximate
    $884 million in 2011, $951 million in 2012,
    $491 million in 2013, $291 million in 2014,
    $169 million for 2015, and $79 million for 2016. These
    amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the
    manufacturers.

On January 14, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment
    to Purchase Agreement No. 1980 with Boeing to exercise
    rights to acquire two Boeing

777-300ER

aircraft for delivery in 2012. The Company’s total purchase
    commitments are expected to be approximately $2.8 billion
    as of the end of the first quarter 2011, reflecting this
    transaction and aircraft purchase deposits paid during that
    period.

In 2008, the Company entered into a new purchase agreement with
    Boeing for the acquisition of 42 firm Boeing

787-9

aircraft and purchase rights to acquire up to 58 additional B787
    aircraft. Per the purchase agreement, the first such aircraft
    was scheduled to be delivered in 2012, and the last firm
    aircraft was scheduled to be delivered in 2018 with deliveries
    of additional aircraft, if any, scheduled between 2015 and 2020.
    In July 2010, the Company and Boeing agreed upon a revised
    delivery schedule due to the impact of the overall Boeing 787
    program delay on American’s delivery positions. The first
    aircraft is currently scheduled to be delivered in 2014, and the
    last firm aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2018 with
    deliveries of additional aircraft, if any, scheduled between
    2016 and 2021. Additionally, the revised delivery schedule
    includes terms and conditions consistent with the original
    agreement and allows the Company the confirmation rights
    described below.

Under the current

787-9

purchase agreement and supplemental agreement, except as
    described below, American will not be obligated to purchase a

787-9

aircraft unless it gives Boeing notice confirming its election
    to do so at least 18 months prior to the scheduled delivery
    date for that aircraft. If American does not give that notice
    with respect to an aircraft, the aircraft will no longer be
    subject to the

787-9

purchase agreement. These confirmation rights may be exercised
    until a specified date (May 1, 2014 under the current
    agreement) provided that those rights will terminate earlier if
    American reaches a collective bargaining agreement with its
    pilot union that includes provisions enabling American to
    utilize the

787-9

to
    American’s satisfaction in the operations desired by
    American, or if American confirms its election to purchase any
    of the initial 42

787-9

aircraft. While there can be no assurances, American expects
    that it will have reached an agreement as described above with
    its pilots union prior to the first notification date. In either
    of those events, American would become obligated to purchase all
    of the initial 42 aircraft then subject to the purchase
    agreement. If neither of those events occurs prior to the
    specified date (May 1, 2014 under the current agreement)
    then on that date American may elect to purchase all of the
    initial 42 aircraft then subject to the purchase agreement,
    and if it does not elect to do so, the purchase agreement will
    terminate in its entirety.

Credit Ratings

AMR’s and American’s
    credit ratings are significantly below investment grade.
    Additional reductions in AMR’s or American’s credit
    ratings could further increase the Company’s borrowing or
    other costs and further restrict the availability of future
    financing.

Credit Card Processing and Other
    Reserves

American has agreements with a number of
    credit card companies and processors to accept credit cards for
    the sale of air travel and other services. Under certain of
    these agreements, the credit card processor may hold back a
    reserve from American’s credit card receivables following
    the occurrence of certain events, including the failure of
    American to maintain certain levels of liquidity (as specified
    in each agreement).

Under such agreements, the amount of the reserve that may be
    required generally is based on the processor’s exposure to
    the Company under the applicable agreement and, in the case a
    reserve is required because of AMR’s failure to maintain a
    certain level of liquidity, the amount of such liquidity. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company was not required to maintain
    any reserve under such agreements. If circumstances were to
    occur that would allow the credit card processor to require the
    Company to maintain a reserve, the Company’s liquidity
    would be negatively impacted.

Cash Flow Activity

The Company’s cash
    flow from operating activities during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 generated $1.2 billion, which is an
    increase of $311 million from the same period in 2009
    primarily due to an improved revenue environment in 2010 as
    compared to 2009.


The Company made debt and capital lease payments of
    $1.2 billion in 2010 while capital expenditures during 2010
    were $2.0 billion and primarily included new aircraft and
    aircraft modifications. Substantially all of the aircraft were
    financed through previously arranged financing transactions.

Due to the current value of the Company’s derivative
    contracts, some agreements with counterparties require
    collateral to be deposited by the counterparty. As of
    December 31, 2010, the cash collateral held by AMR from
    such counterparties was $73 million as compared to
    $14 million held by such counterparties at
    December 31, 2009. Cash held at December 31, 2010 from
    counterparties is included in short-term investments. As a
    result of movements in fuel prices, the cash collateral amounts
    held by AMR or the counterparties to such contracts, as the case
    may be, can vary significantly.

In the past, the Company has from time to time refinanced,
    redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce
    its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its balance
    sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash
    positions and other considerations, the Company may continue to
    take such actions.

Certain of the Company’s debt financing agreements contain
    loan to value ratio covenants and require the Company to
    periodically appraise the collateral. Pursuant to such
    agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified
    threshold, the Company may be required to subject additional
    qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash
    collateral) or, in the alternative, to pay down such financing,
    in whole or in part, with premium (if any).

Compensation

On January 18, 2011, the
    Company approved the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) for
    American. All U.S. based employees of American are eligible
    to participate in the AIP. The AIP is American’s annual
    bonus plan and provides for the payment of awards in the event
    certain financial

and/or

customer service metrics are satisfied.

Working Capital

AMR (principally American)
    historically operates with a working capital deficit, as do most
    other airline companies. In addition, the Company has
    historically relied heavily on external financing to fund
    capital expenditures. More recently, the Company has also relied
    on external financing to fund operating losses, employee pension
    obligations and debt maturities.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

American has
    determined that it holds a significant variable interest in, but
    is not the primary beneficiary of, certain trusts that are the
    lessors under 83 of its aircraft operating leases. These leases
    contain a fixed price purchase option, which allows American to
    purchase the aircraft at a predetermined price on a specified
    date. However, American does not guarantee the residual value of
    the aircraft. As of December 31, 2010, future lease
    payments required under these leases totaled $1.1 billion.

Certain special facility revenue bonds have been issued by
    certain municipalities primarily to purchase equipment and
    improve airport facilities that are leased by American and
    accounted for as operating leases. Approximately
    $1.5 billion of these bonds (with total future payments of
    approximately $3.2 billion as of December 31,
    2010) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both.
    Approximately $177 million of these special facility
    revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require
    American to make operating lease payments sufficient to
    repurchase the bonds at various times: $112 million in 2014
    and $65 million in 2015. Although American has the right to
    remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that these bonds
    will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or
    purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce
    existing rent leveling accruals or are considered prepaid
    facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease
    commitments.

In addition, the Company had other operating leases, primarily
    for aircraft and airport facilities, with total future lease
    payments of $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2010.
    Entering into aircraft leases allows the Company to obtain
    aircraft without immediate cash outflows.

Pension Obligations

The Company is required to
    make minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension plans
    under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the Pension Funding
    Equity Act of 2004, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and the
    Pension Relief Act of 2010. The Company estimates its 2011
    required contribution to its defined benefit pension plans to be
    approximately $520 million under the provisions of these
    acts.

The Company’s obligation for pension and retiree medical
    and other benefits increased from $7.4 billion at
    December 31, 2009 to $7.9 billion at December 31,
    2010, largely the result of a lower discount rate associated
    with declining interest rates in the bond markets in 2010. A
    significant portion of this increase is recorded in Accumulated
    other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’
    equity.

Results
    of Operations

The Company recorded a net loss of $471 million in 2010
    compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion in 2009. The
    Company’s smaller net loss in 2010 reflects a strengthening
    of the revenue environment in a weak global economy which led to
    higher passenger revenues, partially offset by higher fuel
    prices. In addition to higher fuel expenses, the Company’s
    2010 results were negatively impacted by $81 million in
    special items. The special items consist of $53 million
    related to the Venezuelan currency remeasurement in January 2010
    and a $28 million non-cash impairment of certain routes in
    Latin America.

The Company recorded a net loss of $1.5 billion in 2009
    compared to a net loss of $2.1 billion in 2008. The
    Company’s 2009 loss was primarily attributable to a
    significant decrease in passenger revenue due to lower traffic
    and passenger yield. The 2009 results were also negatively
    impacted by a net amount of $107 million in special items,
    restructuring charges and a non-cash tax item. 2009 special
    items of $184 million included the impairment of certain
    route and slot authorities, primarily in Latin America, and
    losses on certain sale leaseback transactions. Restructuring
    charges for 2009 were $171 million and related to announced
    capacity reductions, including the grounding of the Airbus A300
    fleet and the impairment of certain Embraer RJ-135 aircraft.
    Also included in 2009 results is a $248 million non-cash
    tax benefit resulting from the allocation of the tax expense to
    other comprehensive income items recognized during 2009. The
    2009 restructuring charges, the 2009 non-cash tax item and the
    2010 and 2009 route impairments are described in Notes 2, 8
    and 11, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company recorded a net loss of $2.1 billion in 2008.
    The Company’s 2008 results included an impairment charge of
    $1.1 billion to write the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and
    Embraer RJ-135 fleets and certain related long-lived assets down
    to their estimated fair values, a $71 million accrual for
    employee severance cost and a $33 million expense related
    to the grounding of leased Airbus A300 aircraft prior to lease
    expiration, all in connection with announced capacity reductions
    and included in Special charges in the Consolidated Statements
    of Operations. In addition, the Company’s 2008 results
    included the sale of American Beacon for a net gain of
    $432 million included in

Miscellaneous-net

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the impact of a
    pension settlement charge of $103 million for one of the
    Company’s defined benefit plans included in Wages, salaries
    and benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Revenues

2010 Compared to 2009

The Company’s
    revenues increased approximately $2.3 billion, or
    11.3 percent, to $22.2 billion in 2010 compared to
    2009 due to increased traffic and higher average fares.
    American’s passenger revenues increased by
    11.5 percent, or $1.7 billion, on a capacity (ASM)
    increase of 1.0 percent. American’s passenger load
    factor increased approximately 1.2 points to 81.9 percent
    and passenger revenue yield per passenger mile increased
    8.7 percent to 13.36 cents. This resulted in an increase in
    passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) of
    10.4 percent to 10.94 cents. In 2010, American derived
    approximately 60 percent of its passenger revenues from
    domestic operations and approximately 40 percent from
    international operations (flights serving


international destinations). Following is additional information
    regarding American’s domestic and international RASM and

Regional Affiliates’ passenger revenues, which are based on
    industry standard proration agreements for flights connecting to
    American flights, increased $315 million or
    15.7 percent as a result of passenger yield increase of
    8.4 percent. Regional Affiliates’ traffic increased
    6.7 percent to 8.8 billion revenue passenger miles
    (RPMs), while capacity increased 5.3 percent to
    12.2 billion ASMs, resulting in a 1.0 point increase in
    passenger load factor to 72.4 percent.

Cargo revenues increased 16.3 percent, or $94 million,
    primarily as a result of increased volume, particularly in the
    Latin America and Pacific regions.

Other revenues increased 5.3 percent, or $121 million,
    to $2.4 billion due to increases in certain passenger
    service charge volumes and fees and increased revenue associated
    with the sale of mileage credits in the AAdvantage frequent
    flyer program.

2009 Compared to 2008

The Company’s
    revenues decreased approximately $3.8 billion, or
    16.2 percent, to $19.9 billion in 2009 compared to
    2008. American’s passenger revenues decreased by
    17.5 percent, or $3.2 billion, on a capacity decrease
    of approximately 7.2 percent year over year. Mainline
    passenger load factor increased approximately 0.1 points to
    80.7 percent and passenger revenue yield per passenger mile
    decreased 11.2 percent to 12.28 cents. This resulted in a
    decrease in passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) of
    11.1 percent to 9.91 cents. In 2009, American derived
    approximately 60 percent of its passenger revenues from
    domestic operations and approximately 40 percent from
    international operations (flights serving international
    destinations). Following is additional information regarding

Regional Affiliates’ passenger revenues, which are based on
    industry standard proration agreements for flights connecting to
    American flights, decreased by $474 million, or
    19.1 percent, to $2.0 billion as a result of a
    reduction in capacity, decreased passenger traffic and lower
    yield. Regional Affiliates’ traffic decreased
    6.7 percent to 8.3 billion revenue passenger miles
    (RPMs), while capacity decreased 8.2 percent to
    11.6 billion ASMs, resulting in a 1.2 point increase in
    passenger load factor to 71.4 percent.

Cargo revenues decreased by 33.9 percent, or
    $296 million, primarily due to decreases in advertising
    mail and freight traffic resulting from the current economic
    downturn.

Other revenues increased 5.4 percent, or $118 million,
    to $2.3 billion due to increases in certain passenger
    service charges instituted throughout the year in 2008.


Operating
    Expenses

2010 Compared to 2009

The Company’s total
    operating expenses increased 4.5 percent, or
    $941 million, to $21.9 billion in 2010 compared to
    2009. American’s mainline operating expenses per ASM in
    2010 increased 3.2 percent compared to 2009 to 12.62 cents.
    The increase in operating expense was largely due to a

year-over-year

increase in fuel prices from $2.01 per gallon in 2009 to $2.32
    per gallon in 2010, including the impact of fuel hedging. Fuel
    expense was the Company’s second largest single expense
    category in 2010 and the price increase resulted in
    $847 million in incremental

year-over-year

fuel expense in 2010 (based on the

year-over-year

increase in the average price per gallon multiplied by gallons
    consumed, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedging). A return to
    the recent historically high fuel prices

and/or

disruptions in the supply of fuel would further materially
    adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations. The remaining increase in operating
    expense was primarily due to revenue related expenses, such as
    credit card fees and booking fees and commissions, and increased
    aircraft rent related to the Company’s fleet renewal plan.

2009 Compared to 2008

The Company’s total
    operating expenses decreased 18.5 percent, or
    $4.7 billion, to $20.9 billion in 2009 compared to
    2008. American’s mainline operating expenses per ASM in
    2009 decreased 11.9 percent compared to 2008 to 12.22
    cents. The decrease in operating expense was largely due to a

year-over-year

decrease in AMR’s fuel prices from $3.03 per gallon in 2008
    to $2.01 per gallon in 2009, including the impact of fuel
    hedging. The Company’s unit costs excluding fuel and
    special charges were greater for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 than the year ended December 31,
    2008. Factors driving the increase include increased defined
    benefit pension expenses (due to the stock market decline in
    2008), higher airport rent and landing fees and


cost pressures associated with the Company’s capacity
    reductions announced in 2008 and 2009 and dependability
    initiatives.

Other
    Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) consists of Interest income and expense,
    Interest capitalized and Miscellaneous — net.

2010 Compared to 2009

Decreases in both
    short-term investment balances and interest rates caused a
    decrease in Interest income of $8 million, or
    23.1 percent, to $26 million. Interest expense
    increased $79 million, or 10.7 percent, to
    $823 million primarily as a result of an increase in the
    Company’s long-term debt balance.

2009 Compared to 2008

Decreases in both
    short-term investment balances throughout most of 2009 and
    decreases in interest rates caused a decrease in Interest income
    of $147 million, or 81.2 percent, to $34 million.
    Interest expense decreased $59 million, or
    7.3 percent, to $744 million primarily as a result of
    a decrease in the Company’s long-term debt balance
    throughout most of 2009 and decreases in interest rates on
    variable rate debt.

Income
    Tax Benefit

The Company has recorded in 2010 and 2009 an income tax expense
    credit of approximately $30 million and $36 million,
    respectively, resulting from the Company’s anticipated
    election under applicable sections of the Tax Relief,
    Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of
    2010 and Section 3081 of the Housing and Economic Recovery
    Act of 2008 (as extended by the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009),


allowing corporations to accelerate utilization of certain
    research and alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards
    in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying
    capital investments.

The Company did not record a net tax provision (benefit)
    associated with 2008 net loss due to the Company providing
    a valuation allowance, as discussed in Note 8 to the
    consolidated financial statements. However, during 2009, the
    Company generated a pre-tax loss of $1.8 billion and other
    comprehensive income of approximately $701 million. In
    accordance with accounting standards, the net zero tax provision
    is required to be allocated between Operating loss and
    Accumulated other comprehensive income. Application of this
    guidance during 2009 resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit
    of $248 million, offset by a $248 million charge to
    other comprehensive income related to such items being
    recognized in 2009. See Note 8 for additional information
    regarding the allocation of income tax benefit to Operating
    income and Accumulated other comprehensive income.

Outlook

The Company currently expects capacity for American’s
    mainline jet operations to increase by approximately 3.8% in the
    first quarter of 2011 versus first quarter 2010. American’s
    mainline capacity for the full year 2011 is expected to increase
    approximately 3.6% from 2010 with a 1% increase in domestic
    capacity and a 7.7% growth in international capacity.

The Company expects first quarter 2011 mainline unit costs to
    increase approximately 1.6 percent year over year. The
    first quarter 2011 unit cost expectations reflect the
    increase in the cost of fuel during the second half of 2010 and
    projected fuel prices in 2011. Despite anticipated higher
    revenue-related expenses (such as booking fees and commissions)
    and financing costs related to the Company’s new Boeing

737-800

aircraft, the Company expects first quarter mainline unit costs
    excluding fuel to be 3.2% lower than the prior year periods.


The Company’s results are significantly affected by the
    price of jet fuel, which is in turn affected by a number of
    factors beyond the Company’s control. Although fuel prices
    abated considerably from the record high prices recorded in July
    2008, they have increased since the first quarter of 2009,
    particularly recently, and remain high and extremely volatile by
    historical standards.

Other
    Information

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The
    preparation of the Company’s financial statements in
    conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    The Company believes its estimates and assumptions are
    reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of the
    recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates.
    The Company has identified the following critical accounting
    policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of
    the Company’s financial statements: long-lived assets,
    routes, passenger revenue, frequent flyer program, stock
    compensation, pensions and retiree medical and other benefits,
    income taxes and derivatives accounting.

Long-lived assets

— The Company has
    approximately $16 billion of long-lived assets as of
    December 31, 2010, including approximately $15 billion
    related to flight equipment and other fixed assets. In addition
    to the original cost of these assets, the recorded value of the
    Company’s fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates
    made by the Company, including estimated useful lives, salvage
    values and the Company’s determination as to whether
    aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. In accordance
    with U.S. GAAP, the Company records impairment charges on
    long-lived assets used in operations when events and
    circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the
    net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value.
    In making these determinations, the Company uses certain
    assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated
    fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated future cash
    flows expected to be generated by the assets, generally
    evaluated at a fleet level, which are based on additional
    assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service and
    estimated salvage values. A change in the Company’s fleet
    plan has been the primary indicator that has resulted in an
    impairment charge in the past.

The majority of American’s fleet types are depreciated over
    30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of the
    Company’s aircraft will be significantly different than the
    current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that
    impact the Company’s fleet plan, including positive or
    negative developments in the areas described above. For example,
    operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher
    maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if the Company
    replaced the aircraft. At some point in the future, higher
    operating costs, including higher fuel expense,

and/or

improvement in the Company’s economic condition, could
    change the Company’s analysis of the impact of retaining
    aircraft versus replacing them with new aircraft.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, due to the continuing severe
    downturn in the global economy and weakness in the regional jet
    aircraft market, the Company’s plan to sell certain of its
    Embraer RJ-135 aircraft was no longer feasible at the amount for
    which these aircraft had been valued. Consequently, the Company
    reclassified these aircraft from held for sale to held for use,
    tested them for impairment and concluded the carrying values of
    certain of its Embraer RJ-135 aircraft were no longer
    recoverable.

In the second quarter of 2008, due to the Company’s
    capacity reduction announcement, the Company concluded a
    triggering event had occurred and required that fixed assets be
    tested for impairment. As a result of that testing, the Company
    recorded impairment charges related to its McDonnell Douglas
    MD-80 aircraft and Embraer RJ-135 aircraft. See Note 2 to
    the consolidated financial statements for more information.

International Slots and Route Authorities —

AMR
    performs annual impairment tests on its international slots and
    route authorities, which are indefinite life intangible assets
    and as a result they are not amortized. As discussed above, the
    Company also performs impairment tests when events and
    circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. These
    tests are primarily based on estimates of discounted future cash
    flows, using assumptions based on historical results adjusted to
    reflect the Company’s best estimate of future market and
    operating conditions and also consideration of markets for these
    assets. The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is
    reduced to fair


value. The Company’s estimates of fair value represent its
    best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market
    rates and transactions.

During 2009, the Company adopted guidance on measuring the fair
    value of assets and liabilities. The guidance introduces a
    framework for measuring fair value primarily based on exit
    prices and expands required disclosure about fair value
    measurements of assets and liabilities.

The Company had recorded international slots and route
    authorities of $708 million as of December 31, 2010.
    The Company estimates the fair value of these assets based on
    market information and estimated future cash flows. The Company
    believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however,
    given the significant uncertainty regarding how open skies
    agreements will ultimately affect the Company’s operations
    at Heathrow and Narita, and other international locations that
    are evaluating “open skies”, as well as volatility in
    the revenue and fuel environment, the actual results could
    differ from those estimates. Further, as a part of the annual
    impairment test, it was determined that the fair value of
    certain routes in Latin America was less than the carrying
    value, and therefore, the Company recorded an impairment charge.
    See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information regarding the valuation of the
    Company’s routes.

Passenger revenue —

Passenger ticket sales are
    initially recorded as a component of Air traffic liability.
    Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time
    service is provided. However, due to various factors, including
    the industry’s pricing structure and interline agreements
    throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in
    revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue
    recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized,
    including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the
    evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression
    analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events
    based on the Company’s historical experience, and are
    recognized at the scheduled time of departure. The
    Company’s estimation techniques have been applied
    consistently from year to year. However, due to changes in the
    Company’s ticket refund policy and changes in the travel
    profile of customers, historical trends may not be
    representative of future results.

Frequent flyer program —

American uses the
    incremental cost method to account for the portion of its
    frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn
    mileage credits by flying on American or its regional affiliates.

The Company considers breakage in its incremental cost
    calculation and recognizes breakage on AAdvantage miles sold
    over the estimated period of usage for sold miles that are
    ultimately redeemed. The Company calculates its breakage
    estimate using separate breakage rates for miles earned by
    flying on American and miles earned through other companies who
    have purchased AAdvantage miles for distribution to their
    customers, due to differing behavior patterns. Management
    considers historical patterns of account breakage to be a useful
    indicator when estimating future breakage. Future program
    redemption opportunities can significantly alter customer
    behavior from historical patterns with respect to inactive
    accounts. Such changes may result in material changes to the
    frequent flyer liability, as well as recognized revenues from
    the program.

American includes fuel, food, and passenger insurance costs in
    the calculation of incremental cost. These estimates are
    generally updated based upon the Company’s

12-month

historical average of such costs. American also accrues a
    frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits expected to be
    used for travel on participating airlines based on historical
    usage patterns and contractual rates.

Revenue earned from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies
    is recognized in two components. The first component represents
    the revenue for air transportation sold and is valued at fair
    value. This revenue is deferred along with revenue related to
    expected breakage of sold miles and recognized over the period
    the mileage is expected to be used, which is currently estimated
    to be 28 months. The second revenue component, based on the
    residual method and representing the marketing services sold, is
    recognized as related services are provided.

The Company’s total liability for future AAdvantage award
    redemptions for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American,
    American Eagle or participating airlines, as well as
    unrecognized revenue from selling AAdvantage miles to other
    companies, was approximately $1.4 billion and
    $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively (and is recorded as a component of Air traffic
    liability in the consolidated balance sheets),


representing 16.3 percent and 19.2 percent of
    AMR’s total current liabilities, at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

The approximate number of free travel awards used for travel on
    American and American Eagle was 5.6 million one-way travel
    awards in 2010 (or 2.8 million round trip awards) and
    5.2 million one-way travel awards in 2009 (or
    2.6 million round trip travel awards) representing
    approximately 8.8 and 8.9 percent of passengers boarded in
    each year, respectively. The Company believes displacement of
    revenue passengers is minimal given the Company’s load
    factors, its ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory,
    and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total
    passengers boarded.

Changes to the percentage of the amount of revenue deferred,
    deferred recognition period, percentage of awards expected to be
    redeemed for travel on participating airlines, breakage or cost
    per mile estimates could have a significant impact on the
    Company’s revenues or incremental cost accrual in the year
    of the change as well as in future years.

Stock Compensation

— The Company
    grants awards under its various share based payment plans and
    utilizes option pricing models or fair value models to estimate
    the fair value of its awards. Certain awards contain a market
    performance condition, which is taken into account in estimating
    the fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of those
    awards is calculated by multiplying the stock price on the date
    of grant by the expected payout percentage and the number of
    shares granted. The Company accounts for these awards over the
    three year term of the award based on the grant date fair value,
    provided adequate shares are available to settle the awards. For
    awards where adequate shares are not anticipated to be available
    or that only permit settlement in cash, the fair value is
    re-measured each reporting period.

Pensions and retiree medical and other
    benefits

— The Company recognizes the
    funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of
    plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of its
    pension and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance
    sheet with a corresponding adjustment to Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss).

The Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit
    costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial
    assumptions and methodologies. The Company uses certain
    assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the:
    (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan
    assets; and (iii) expected health care cost trend rate and,
    starting in 2007 (iv) the estimated age of pilot retirement
    (as discussed below).

These assumptions as of December 31 were:



Discount rate (cost/liability)

Pilot Retirement Age



When establishing our discount rate, to measure our obligations,
    we match high quality corporate bonds available in the
    marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit
    disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis
    points as of December 31, 2010 would increase the
    Company’s pension and postretirement benefits obligations
    by approximately $850 million and $170 million,
    respectively, and increase estimated 2011 pension and
    postretirement benefits expense by $80 million and less
    than $1 million, respectively.

The expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation
    of the Company’s historical trends and experience taking
    into account current and expected market conditions and the
    Company’s target asset allocation of


35 percent longer duration corporate and
    U.S. government/agency bonds, 28 percent
    U.S. value stocks, 20 percent developed international
    stocks, 6 percent emerging markets stocks and bonds and
    11 percent alternative (private) investments. The expected
    return on plan assets component of the Company’s net
    periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of
    plan assets and the Company’s target asset allocation. The
    Company monitors its actual asset allocation and believes that
    its long-term asset allocation will continue to approximate its
    target allocation. The Company’s historical annualized
    ten-year rate of return on plan assets, calculated using a
    geometric compounding of monthly returns, is approximately
    7.7 percent as of December 31, 2010. Lowering the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by
    50 basis points as of December 31, 2010 would increase
    estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately $40 million.

The health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of
    the Company’s historical trends and experience taking into
    account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the
    assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points
    would increase estimated 2011 postretirement benefits expense by
    $22 million.

Income taxes

— The Company generally
    believes that the positions taken on previously filed income tax
    returns are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing
    authorities. The Company has recorded income tax and related
    interest liabilities where the Company believes its position may
    not be sustained or where the full income tax benefit will not
    be recognized. The effects of potential income tax benefits
    resulting from the Company’s unrecognized tax positions are
    not reflected in the tax balances of the financial statements.
    Recognized and unrecognized tax positions are reviewed and
    adjusted as events occur that affect the Company’s judgment
    about the recognizability of income tax benefits, such as
    lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax
    audits, release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a
    court decision affecting a particular tax position. The Company
    records a deferred tax asset valuation allowance when it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. The Company considers its
    historical earnings, trends, and outlook for future years in
    making this determination. The Company had a deferred tax
    valuation allowance of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion,
    respectively, at December 31, 2010 and 2009. See
    Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

Derivatives

— As required by
    U.S. GAAP, the Company assesses, both at the inception of
    each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that
    are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in
    offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. In doing
    so, the Company uses a regression model to determine the
    correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to
    hedge jet fuel (e.g., NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the
    price of jet fuel. The Company also monitors the actual dollar
    offset of the hedges’ market values as compared to
    hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel hedge contracts are
    generally deemed to be “highly effective” if the
    R-squared is greater than 80 percent and the dollar offset
    correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent. The
    Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it
    determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly
    effective as a hedge or if it decides to discontinue the hedging
    relationship. The fair value of the Company’s hedging
    contracts is recorded in Current Assets or Current Liabilities
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is recorded
    gross of the collateral posted and on a trade basis. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company had derivative contracts in
    an asset position at fair value of $269 million including a
    liability related to contracts that settled in December. A
    deferred gain of $153 million was recorded in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (OCI) at December 31, 2010 and
    will be recognized in future periods as contracts settle.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In November of 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued new guidance that significantly changes the
    accounting for revenue in arrangements with multiple
    deliverables by requiring entities to separately account for
    individual deliverables in more of these arrangements and
    estimate the fair value of each component individually on a
    pro-rata basis. The guidance removes the criterion that entities
    must use vendor-specific objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value when separately accounting for deliverables, allowing for
    the recognition of revenue in a manner that more closely aligns
    with the economics of certain arrangements, based on
    management’s estimate of the selling price. The standard
    must be applied prospectively to revenue arrangements entered
    into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or
    after June 15, 2010. In addition, the FASB significantly
    expanded the disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue
    arrangements. Although the Company continues to evaluate the
    impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated
    financial statements, the


Company believes the impact of adoption will not be material in
    2011, but could have a significant impact on future results as
    new or materially modified revenue arrangements with certain
    partners are established in the normal course of business.

Glossary
    of Defined Terms

ASM — Available Seat Mile.

A measure
    of capacity. ASMs equal the total number of seats available for
    transporting passengers during a reporting period multiplied by
    the total number of miles flown during that period.

CASM — (Operating) Cost per Available Seat
    Mile.

The amount of operating cost incurred per
    ASM during a reporting period, also referred to as “unit
    cost.”

Passenger Load Factor

— A measure of utilized
    available seating capacity calculated by dividing RPMs by ASMs
    for a reporting period.

Passenger Mile Yield or Yield — The amount of
    passenger revenue earned per RPM during a reporting period.

RASM— Passenger Revenue per ASM.

The
    amount of passenger revenue earned per ASM during a reporting
    period. Passenger RASM is also referred to as “unit
    revenue.”

RPM — Revenue Passenger Mile.

One
    revenue-paying passenger transported one mile. RPMs equal the
    number of revenue passengers during a reporting period
    multiplied by the number of miles flown by those passengers
    during that during that period. RPMs are also referred to as
    “traffic.”

ITEM 7(A).

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market
    Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions

The risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive
    instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from
    adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange
    rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity
    analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse
    changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they
    consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the
    Company’s exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual
    results may differ. The Company does not hold or issue
    derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See
    Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for
    accounting policies and additional information regarding
    derivatives.

Aircraft Fuel

The Company’s earnings are
    substantially affected by changes in the price and availability
    of aircraft fuel. In order to provide a measure of control over
    price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and
    maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight
    operations. The Company also manages the price risk of fuel
    costs primarily by using jet fuel and heating oil hedging
    contracts. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical
    10 percent increase in the December 31, 2010 and 2009
    cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected 2011 fuel usage,
    such an increase would result in an increase to Aircraft fuel
    expense of approximately $502 million in 2011, inclusive of
    the impact of effective fuel hedge instruments outstanding at
    December 31, 2010, and assumes the Company’s fuel
    hedging program remains effective. Such an increase would have
    resulted in an increase to projected Aircraft fuel expense of
    approximately $499 million in 2010, inclusive of the impact
    of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2009.
    As of January 2011, the Company had cash flow hedges, with
    collars and options, covering approximately 35 percent of
    its estimated 2011 fuel requirements. Comparatively, as of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had hedged, with collars and
    options, approximately 24 percent of its estimated 2010
    fuel requirements. The consumption hedged for 2011 by cash flow
    hedges is capped at an average price of approximately $2.52 per
    gallon of jet fuel, and the Company’s collars have an
    average floor price of approximately $1.92 per gallon of jet
    fuel (both the capped and floor price exclude taxes and
    transportation costs). The Company’s collars represent
    approximately 30 percent of its estimated 2011 fuel
    requirements. A deterioration of the Company’s financial
    position could negatively affect the Company’s ability to
    hedge fuel in the future.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative
    positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related
    commodities. The Company assesses, both at the inception of each
    hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are
    used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in
    offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. In doing
    so, the Company uses a regression model to determine the
    correlation of the change in prices


of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g., NYMEX Heating
    oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel. The Company also
    monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges’ market
    values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel
    hedge contracts are generally deemed to be “highly
    effective” if the R-squared is greater than 80 percent
    and the dollar offset correlation is within 80 percent to
    125 percent. The Company discontinues hedge accounting
    prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer
    expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to
    discontinue the hedging relationship.

Foreign Currency

The Company is exposed to the
    effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the
    U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating
    revenues and expenses. The Company’s largest exposure comes
    from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and
    various Latin American currencies. The Company does not
    currently have a foreign currency hedge program related to its
    foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. A uniform
    10 percent strengthening in the value of the
    U.S. dollar from December 31, 2010 and 2009 levels
    relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has
    foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in
    operating income of approximately $170 million and
    $136 million for the years ending December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, due to the Company’s
    foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its foreign-denominated
    expenses. This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon
    projected 2011 and 2010 foreign currency-denominated revenues
    and expenses as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

On January 11, 2010, the Venezuelan Government devalued its
    currency from 2.15 bolivars per U.S. dollar to 4.30
    bolivars per U.S. dollar and the currency was designated as
    hyperinflationary. As a result, the Company recognized a loss of
    $53 million related to the currency remeasurement in
    January 2010. The Company does not expect any significant
    ongoing impact of the currency devaluation on its operations in
    Venezuela, but there can be no assurances to that effect.

Interest

The Company’s earnings are also
    affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those
    changes have on its interest income from cash and short-term
    investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt
    instruments. The Company’s largest exposure with respect to
    variable rate debt comes from changes in the London Interbank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company had variable rate debt
    instruments representing approximately 23 percent of its
    total long-term debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009. If the
    Company’s interest rates average 10 percent more in
    2011 than they did at December 31, 2010, the Company’s
    interest expense would increase by approximately $7 million
    and interest income from cash and short-term investments would
    increase by approximately $3 million. In comparison, at
    December 31, 2009, the Company estimated that if interest
    rates averaged 10 percent more in 2010 than they did at
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s interest expense
    would have increased by approximately $8 million and
    interest income from cash and short-term investments would have
    increased by approximately $1 million. These amounts are
    determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical
    interest rates on the Company’s variable rate long-term
    debt and cash and short-term investment balances at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Market risk for fixed rate long-term debt is estimated as the
    potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical
    10 percent decrease in interest rates and amounts to
    approximately $237 million and $316 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair values
    of the Company’s long-term debt were estimated using quoted
    market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the
    Company’s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
    borrowing arrangements.

AMR Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    AMR Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our
    audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
    the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial
    statements and schedule are the responsibility of AMR
    Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express
    an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of AMR Corporation at December 31, 2010
    and 2009 and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), AMR
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 16, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

AMR
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Summary
    of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2010
    and for the three years ended December 31, 2010 include the
    accounts of AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) and its wholly
    owned subsidiaries, including (i) its principal subsidiary,
    American Airlines, Inc. (American) and (ii) its regional
    airline subsidiary, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation and its
    primary subsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and
    Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, AMR Eagle). The
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries as well as VIEs
    for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All
    significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In November of
    2009, the FASB issued new guidance that significantly changes
    the accounting for revenue in arrangements with multiple
    deliverables by requiring entities to separately account for
    individual deliverables in more of these arrangements. The
    guidance removes the criterion that entities must use
    vendor-specific objective and reliable evidence of fair value
    when separately accounting for deliverables, allowing for the
    recognition of revenue in a manner that more closely aligns with
    the economics of certain arrangements based on management’s
    estimate of the selling price. The standard must be applied
    prospectively to revenue arrangements entered into or materially
    modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15,
    2010. In addition, the FASB significantly expanded the
    disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue
    arrangements. Although the Company continues to evaluate the
    impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated
    financial statements, the Company believes the impact of
    adoption will not be material in 2011, but could have a
    significant impact on future results as new or materially
    modified revenue arrangements with certain partners are
    established in the normal course of business.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
    reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
    and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments

The
    Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related
    primarily to collateral held to support projected workers’
    compensation obligations.

Inventories

Spare parts, materials and
    supplies relating to flight equipment are carried at average
    acquisition cost and are expensed when used in operations.
    Allowances for obsolescence are provided — over the
    estimated useful life of the related aircraft and
    engines — for spare parts expected to be on hand at
    the date aircraft are retired from service. Allowances are also
    provided for spare parts currently identified as excess and
    obsolete. These allowances are based on management estimates,
    which are subject to change.

Maintenance and Repair Costs

Maintenance and
    repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged
    to operating expense as incurred, except costs incurred for
    maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contract
    agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms when an
    obligation exists.

Intangible Assets

Route acquisition costs and
    airport operating and gate lease rights represent the purchase
    price attributable to route authorities (including international
    airport take-off and landing slots), domestic airport take-off
    and landing slots and airport gate leasehold rights acquired.
    Indefinite-lived intangible assets (route acquisition costs and
    international slots and related international take-off and
    landing slots) are tested for impairment annually on
    December 31, rather than amortized, or when a triggering
    event occurs, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Such triggering
    events may include significant changes to the Company’s
    network or capacity, or the implementation of open skies
    agreements in countries where the Company operates flights.
    Airport operating and gate lease rights are being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over 25 years to a zero residual value.

Statements of Cash Flows

Short-term
    investments, without regard to remaining maturity at
    acquisition, are not considered as cash equivalents for purposes
    of the statements of cash flows.

Measurement of Asset Impairments

The Company
    records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in
    operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
    assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is
    considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated
    to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying amount
    of the asset and the net book value of the asset exceeds its
    estimated fair value. In making these determinations, the
    Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not limited to:
    (i) estimated fair value of the asset; and
    (ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated
    by the asset, which are based on additional assumptions such as
    asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used in
    the Company’s operations and estimated salvage values.

Equipment and Property

The provision for
    depreciation of operating equipment and property is computed on
    the straight-line method applied to each unit of property,
    except that major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are
    depreciated on a group basis. The depreciable lives used for the
    principal depreciable asset classifications are:

Depreciable Life

American jet aircraft and engines

20 — 30 years

Other regional aircraft and engines

16 — 20 years

Major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies

Life of equipment to which applicable

Improvements to leased flight equipment

Lesser of remaining lease term or expected useful life

Buildings and improvements (principally on leased land)

5 — 30 years or term of lease, including
    estimated renewal options when renewal is economically compelled
    at key airports

Furniture, fixtures and other equipment

3 — 10 years

Capitalized software

5 — 10 years

Residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts,
    avionics and assemblies are generally five to ten percent,
    except when guaranteed by a third party for a different amount.

Equipment and property under capital leases are amortized over
    the term of the leases or, in the case of certain aircraft, over
    their expected useful lives. Lease terms vary but are generally
    six to 25 years for aircraft and seven to 40 years for
    other leased equipment and property.

Regional Affiliates

Revenue from ticket sales
    is generally recognized when service is provided. Regional
    Affiliates revenues for flights connecting to American flights
    are based on industry standard proration agreements.

Passenger Revenue

Passenger ticket sales are
    initially recorded as a component of Air traffic liability.
    Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time
    service is provided. However, due to various factors, including
    the complex pricing structure and interline agreements
    throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in
    revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue
    recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized,
    including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the
    evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression
    analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events
    based on the Company’s historical experience, and are
    recorded at the scheduled time of departure.

Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end
    customers are collected by the Company as an agent and remitted
    to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented
    on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statement of
    operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the
    appropriate taxing authority.

Frequent Flyer Program

The estimated
    incremental cost of providing free travel awards is accrued for
    mileage credits earned by using American’s service that are
    expected to be redeemed in the future. American also accrues a
    frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits that are
    expected to be used for travel on participating airlines based
    on historical usage patterns and contractual rates. American
    sells mileage credits and related services


AMR
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to companies participating in its frequent flyer program. The
    portion of the revenue related to the sale of mileage credits,
    representing the revenue for air transportation sold, is valued
    at fair value and is deferred and amortized over 28 months,
    which approximates the expected period over which the mileage
    credits are used. Breakage of sold miles is recognized over the
    estimated period of usage. The remaining portion of the revenue,
    representing the marketing services sold and administrative
    costs associated with operating the AAdvantage program, is
    recognized upon sale as a component of Other revenues, as the
    related services have been provided. The Company’s total
    liability for future AAdvantage award redemptions for free,
    discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or
    participating airlines as well as unrecognized revenue from
    selling AAdvantage miles was approximately $1.4 billion
    (and is recorded as a component of Air traffic liability on the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets) at December 31,
    2010 and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2009.

Income Taxes

The Company generally believes
    that the positions taken on previously filed income tax returns
    are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing
    authorities. The Company has recorded income tax and related
    interest liabilities where the Company believes its position may
    not be sustained or where the full income tax benefit will not
    be recognized. Thus, the effects of potential income tax
    benefits resulting from the Company’s unrecognized tax
    positions are not reflected in the tax balances of the financial
    statements. Recognized and unrecognized tax positions are
    reviewed and adjusted as events occur that affect the
    Company’s judgment about the recognizability of income tax
    benefits, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations,
    conclusion of tax audits, release of administrative guidance, or
    rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax
    position.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses on a
    straight-line basis the costs of advertising as incurred
    throughout the year. Advertising expense was $165 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2010, and $153 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008.

Subsequent Events

In connection with
    preparation of the consolidated financial statements and in
    accordance U.S. GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent
    events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2010
    and determined that no additional disclosure to that presented
    in this

Form 10-K

was necessary.

2.

Special
    Charges and Restructuring Activities

As a result of the revenue environment, high fuel prices and the
    Company’s restructuring activities, including its capacity
    reductions, the Company has recorded a number of charges during
    the last few years. In 2008 and 2009, the Company announced
    capacity reductions due to unprecedented high fuel costs at that
    time and the other challenges facing the industry. In connection
    with these capacity reductions, the Company incurred special
    charges related to aircraft, employee reductions and certain
    other charges.

Aircraft
    Charges

As part of these capacity reductions, the Company grounded its
    leased Airbus A300 aircraft prior to lease expiration. In 2009,
    the Company incurred approximately $94 million in net
    present value of future lease payments and lease return costs
    related to the grounding of the leased Airbus A300 fleet. The
    Company estimates that virtually all of these charges will
    result in future cash expenditures. Further, the Company also
    wrote down its owned Airbus A300 aircraft and related inventory
    to estimated salvage value in the fourth quarter of 2009,
    resulting in a non-cash expense of $20 million. All Airbus
    A300 aircraft were permanently retired as of 2009.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, due to the continuing severe
    downturn in the global economy and weakness in the regional jet
    aircraft market, the Company’s plan to sell certain of its
    Embraer RJ-135 aircraft was no longer feasible at the amount for
    which these aircraft had been valued. Consequently, the Company
    reclassified these aircraft from held for sale to held for use,
    tested them for impairment and concluded the carrying values of
    certain of its Embraer RJ-135 aircraft were no longer
    recoverable. Therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2009, the
    Company recorded an impairment charge of $42 million to
    write these aircraft down to their estimated fair values. In
    addition, these aircraft will now resume depreciation
    prospectively. In determining the fair values of these aircraft,
    the Company


AMR
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

considered recent transactions for sales of similar aircraft and
    the value of the underlying engines. No portion of the
    impairment charge will result in future cash expenditures.

Employee
    Charges

In conjunction with the capacity reductions announced in 2008,
    the Company reduced its workforce commensurate with the
    announced system-wide capacity reductions. This reduction in
    workforce was accomplished through various measures, including
    voluntary programs, part-time work schedules, furloughs in
    accordance with collective bargaining agreements, and other
    reductions.

The following table summarizes the components of the
    Company’s special charges, the remaining accruals for these
    charges and the capacity reduction related charges (in millions)

Other

On September 22, 2001, the Air Transportation Safety and
    System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act) was signed into
    law. The Stabilization Act provides that, notwithstanding any
    other provision of law, liability for all claims, whether
    compensatory or punitive, arising from the Terrorist Attacks,
    against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability coverage
    maintained by the air carrier. Based upon estimates provided by
    the Company’s insurance providers, the Company initially
    recorded a liability of approximately $2.3 billion for
    claims arising from the Terrorist Attacks, after considering the
    liability protections provided for by the Stabilization Act. The
    receivable and the liability, recorded in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet as Other assets and Other liabilities
    and deferred credits, respectively, was $1.6 billion and
    $1.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

All short-term investments are classified as

The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value
    for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach
    uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
    transactions involving identical or comparable assets or
    liabilities. The Company’s short-term investments
    classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a
    non-active market for valuation of these securities. The
    Company’s fuel derivative contracts, which consist of
    commodity collars and calls, are valued using energy and
    commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs
    with quantitative models and processes to generate forward
    curves and volatilities. No changes in valuation techniques or
    inputs occurred during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Commitments,
    Contingencies and Guarantees

As of December 31, 2010, American had 15 Boeing

737-800

aircraft purchase commitments in 2011 and 28 Boeing

737-800

aircraft purchase commitments in 2012 and, in addition to those
    commitments, American had firm purchase commitments for eleven
    Boeing

737-800

aircraft and seven Boeing 777 aircraft scheduled to be delivered
    in 2013 through 2016. American also previously announced plans
    (subject to certain reconfirmation rights) to acquire 42 Boeing

787-9

aircraft, with the right to acquire an additional 58 Boeing

787-9

aircraft. American has selected GE Aviation as the exclusive
    provider of engines for its expected order of Boeing

787-9

aircraft. As of December 31, 2010, AMR Eagle had firm
    purchase commitments for 8 Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft scheduled
    to be delivered in 2011.

As of December 31, 2010, payments for the above purchase
    commitments will approximate $884 million in 2011,
    $951 million in 2012, $491 million in 2013,
    $291 million in 2014, $169 million in 2015 and
    $79 million for 2016. These amounts are net of purchase
    deposits currently held by the manufacturers. American has
    granted Boeing a security interest in American’s purchase
    deposits with Boeing. The Company’s purchase deposits
    totaled $375 million and $639 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

On January 14, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment
    to Purchase Agreement No. 1980 with the Boeing Company to
    exercise rights to acquire two Boeing

777-300ER

aircraft for delivery in 2012. The Company’s total purchase
    commitments are expected to be approximately $2.8 billion
    at the end of the first quarter 2011, reflecting this
    transaction and aircraft purchase deposits paid during that
    period.

On December 18, 2007, the European Commission issued a
    Statement of Objection (SO) against 26 airlines, including the
    Company. The SO alleges that these carriers participated in a
    conspiracy to set surcharges on cargo shipments in violation of
    European Union (EU) law. During 2010 the EU notified the Company
    it was dismissing its investigation against the Company.

On August 26, 2010, the Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA) proposed a $24.2 million civil penalty against
    American, claiming that American failed to properly perform
    certain portions of an FAA Airworthiness Directive concerning
    certain wiring to the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft auxiliary
    hydraulic pump. American plans to challenge the proposed civil
    penalty. The Company has concluded that the amount of the
    penalty, if any, that may be paid is not estimable at
    December 31, 2010.

The Company has contracts related to facility construction or
    improvement projects, primarily at airport locations. The
    contractual obligations related to these projects totaled
    approximately $73 million as of December 31, 2010. The
    Company expects to make payments of $60 million and
    $5 million in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In addition, the
    Company has an information technology support related contract
    that requires minimum annual payments of $100 million in
    2011 and declining to $70 million in 2014 through 2019.

American has a capacity purchase agreement with Chautauqua
    Airlines, Inc. to provide Embraer -140 regional jet services to
    certain markets under the brand
    AmericanConnection

®

.

    Under these arrangements, the Company pays the
    AmericanConnection

®

carrier a fee per block hour to operate the aircraft. The block
    hour fees are designed to cover the
    AmericanConnection

®

carrier’s fully allocated costs plus a margin. Assumptions
    for certain costs such as fuel, landing fees, insurance, and
    aircraft ownership are trued up to actual values on a pass
    through basis. In consideration for these payments, the Company
    retains all passenger and other revenues resulting from the
    operation of the
    AmericanConnection

®

regional jets. Minimum payments under the contracts are
    $56 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2012. In
    addition, if the Company terminates the Chautauqua contract
    without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its 15 Embraer
    aircraft to the Company. If this were to happen, the Company
    would take possession of the aircraft and become liable for
    lease obligations totaling approximately $21 million per
    year with lease expirations in 2018 and 2019.

The Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it
    provides general indemnities in the normal course of business to
    third parties for various risks. The Company is not able to
    estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from
    the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in the
    following paragraphs.

In its aircraft financing agreements, the Company generally
    indemnifies the financing parties, trustees acting on their
    behalf and other relevant parties against liabilities (including
    certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture,
    design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft
    regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the
    negligence of the indemnified parties.

The Company’s loan agreements and other London Interbank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based financing transactions (including
    certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate the
    Company to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental costs
    due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve or
    special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with or
    credit extended by such lender related to the loan,
    (ii) any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the loan
    (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy
    requirements. In addition, the Company’s loan agreements,
    derivative contracts and other financing arrangements typically
    contain a withholding tax provision that requires the Company to
    pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other
    financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on
    such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in
    the applicable tax law.

These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for
    the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no
    limitation on the maximum additional amounts the Company could
    be obligated to pay under such


AMR
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions
    generally would trigger an event of default and, in a secured
    financing transaction, would entitle the lender to foreclose on
    the collateral to realize the amount due.

In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing
    leases and loans and derivative transactions, the lessors,
    lenders

and/or

other
    parties have rights to terminate the transaction based on
    changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events
    or circumstances. In such a case, the Company may be required to
    make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant transaction.

The Company has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport
    and other real estate leases where the Company as lessee
    indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities
    related to the Company’s use of the leased property.
    Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting
    from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not
    liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful
    misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, the Company
    provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for
    contamination related to the Company’s use of the leased
    property.

Under certain contracts with third parties, the Company
    indemnifies the third party against legal liability arising out
    of an action by the third party, or certain other parties. The
    terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under
    these indemnities cannot be determined. The Company has
    liability insurance protecting the Company for some of the
    obligations it has undertaken under these indemnities.

AMR and American have event risk covenants in approximately
    $1 billion of indebtedness and operating leases as of
    December 31, 2010. These covenants permit the holders of
    such obligations to receive a higher rate of return (between 100
    and 600 basis points above the state rate) if a designated
    event, as defined, should occur and the credit ratings of such
    obligations are downgraded below certain levels within a certain
    period of time. No designated event, as defined, had occurred as
    of December 31, 2010.

The Company is involved in certain claims and litigation related
    to its operations. The Company is also subject to regulatory
    assessments in the ordinary course of business. AMR establishes
    reserves for litigation and regulatory matters when those
    matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and
    can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management,
    liabilities, if any, arising from these claims and litigation
    will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows, after consideration of available insurance.

At December 31, 2010, the Company was operating 202 jet
    aircraft and 39 turboprop aircraft under operating leases and 70
    jet aircraft under capital leases. The aircraft leases can
    generally be renewed at rates based on fair market value at the
    end of the lease term for one to five years. Some aircraft
    leases have purchase options at or near the end of the lease
    term at fair market value, but generally not to exceed a stated
    percentage of the defined lessor’s cost of the aircraft or
    a predetermined fixed amount.

During 2010, the Company financed 36 deliveries of Boeing

737-800

aircraft through sale leaseback transactions resulting in gains
    which are being amortized over the respective remaining lease
    terms. During 2009 non-recurring charges related to losses on
    certain sale leasebacks of vintage aircraft of $88 million
    were realized and included in Other operating income.

Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain
    municipalities primarily to improve airport facilities and
    purchase equipment. To the extent these transactions were
    committed to prior to May 21, 1998, they are accounted for
    as operating leases under U.S. GAAP. Approximately
    $1.5 billion of these bonds (with total future payments of
    approximately $3.2 billion as of December 31,
    2010) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both.
    Approximately $177 million of these special facility
    revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require
    American to make operating lease payments sufficient to
    repurchase the bonds at various times: $112 million in 2014
    and $65 million in 2015. Although American has the right to
    remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that these bonds
    will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or
    purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce
    existing rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid
    facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease
    commitments. The special facility revenue bonds that contain
    mandatory tender provisions are listed in the table above at
    their ultimate maturity date rather than their mandatory tender
    provision date.

Rent expense, excluding landing fees, was $1.5 billion,
    $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

American has determined that it holds a significant variable
    interest in, but is not the primary beneficiary of, certain
    trusts that are the lessors under 83 of its aircraft operating
    leases. These leases contain a fixed price purchase option,
    which allows American to purchase the aircraft at a
    predetermined price on a specified date. However, American does
    not guarantee the residual value of the aircraft. As of
    December 31, 2010, future lease payments required under
    these leases totaled $1.1 billion.

Payments of long-term debt (including sinking fund requirements)
    for the next five years are: 2011 — $2.4 billion;
    2012 — $1.7 billion; 2013 —
    $990 million; 2014 — $1.4 billion,
    2015 — $713 million. The 2011 amount includes
    approximately $600 million that was refinanced in January
    2011 as described below and thus is excluded from current
    maturities.

As of December 31, 2010, AMR had issued guarantees covering
    approximately $1.6 billion of American’s tax-exempt
    bond debt (and interest thereon) and $459 million of
    American’s secured debt (and interest thereon). American
    had issued guarantees covering approximately $885 million
    of AMR’s unsecured debt (and interest thereon). In
    addition, as of December 31, 2010, AMR and American had
    issued guarantees covering approximately $216 million of
    AMR Eagle’s secured debt (and interest thereon) and AMR has
    issued additional guarantees covering $2.1 billion of AMR
    Eagle’s secured debt (and interest thereon). AMR also
    guarantees $145 million of American’s leases of
    certain Super ATR aircraft, which are subleased to AMR Eagle.

On January 25, 2011, American closed on a $657 million
    Pass Through Trust Certificates (the Certificates). The
    equipment notes expected to be held by each pass through trust
    will be issued for each of (a) 15 Boeing

737-823

aircraft delivered new to American from 1999 to 2001,
    (b) six Boeing

757-223

aircraft delivered new to American in 1999 and 2001,
    (c) two Boeing

767-323ER

aircraft delivered new to American in 1999 and (d) seven
    Boeing

777-223ER

aircraft delivered new to American from 1999 to 2000. At
    closing, 27 of the aircraft were encumbered by either private
    mortgages or by liens to secure debt incurred in connection with
    the issuance of enhanced equipment trust certificates in 2001,
    all of which mature in 2011. As a result, the proceeds from the
    sale of the Certificates of each trust will initially be held in
    escrow with a depositary, pending the financing of each aircraft
    under an indenture relating to the Certificates. Interest of
    5.25% and 7.00% per annum on the issued and outstanding
    Series A equipment notes and Series B equipment notes,
    respectively, will be payable semiannually on January 31 and
    July 31 of each year, commencing on July 31, 2011, and
    principal on such equipment notes is scheduled for payment on
    January 31 and July 31 of certain years, commencing on
    July 31, 2011. The payment obligations of American under
    the equipment notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed
    by AMR Corporation.

In 2009, American entered into an arrangement under which
    Citibank paid to American $1.0 billion in order to
    pre-purchase AAdvantage Miles (the Advance Purchase Miles)
    under American’s AAdvantage frequent flier loyalty program
    (the Advance Purchase). Approximately $890 million of the
    Advance Purchase proceeds is accounted for as a loan from
    Citibank with the remaining $110 million recorded as
    Deferred Revenue in Other liabilities and deferred credits.

To effect the Advance Purchase, American and Citibank entered
    into an Amended and Restated AAdvantage Participation (as so
    amended and restated, the Amended Participation Agreement).
    Under the Amended Participation Agreement, American agreed that
    it would apply in equal monthly installments, over a five year
    period beginning on January 1, 2012, the Advance Purchase
    Miles to Citibank cardholders’ AAdvantage accounts.

Pursuant to the Advance Purchase, Citibank has been granted a
    first-priority lien in certain of American’s AAdvantage
    program assets, and a lien in certain of American’s
    Heathrow and Narita routes and slots that would be subordinated
    to any subsequent first lien. Commencing on December 31,
    2011, American has the right to repurchase, without premium or
    penalty, any or all of the Advance Purchase Miles that have not
    then been posted to Citibank cardholders’ accounts.
    American is also obligated, in certain circumstances (including
    certain specified termination events under the Amended
    Participation Agreement, certain cross defaults and cross
    acceleration events, and if any Advance Purchase Miles remain at
    the end of the term) to repurchase for cash all of the Advance
    Purchase Miles that have not then been used by Citibank.

The Amended Participation Agreement includes provisions that
    grant Citibank the right to use Advance Purchase Miles on an
    accelerated basis under specified circumstances. American also
    has the right under certain circumstances to release, or
    substitute other comparable collateral for, the Heathrow and
    Narita route and slot related collateral.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2009, American closed a $520 million Pass Through
    Trust Certificates (the Certificates) financing covering
    four Boeing

777-200ER

aircraft owned by American and 16 of American’s Boeing

737-800

deliveries. Equipment notes underlying the Certificates bear
    interest at 10.375 percent per annum and principal and
    interest on the notes are payable in semi-annual installments
    with a balloon payment at maturity in 2019. Approximately
    $200 million of the proceeds from the sale of the
    Certificates were used by American during 2010 for the delivery
    and financing of Boeing

737-800

aircraft.

Also in 2009, American entered into a sale leaseback financing
    transaction with GECAS for Boeing

737-800

aircraft (the 2009 Sale Leaseback) delivered in 2010 and certain
    Boeing

737-800

aircraft deliveries scheduled to be delivered in 2011 for an
    aggregate commitment of $1.6 billion. The 2009 sale
    leaseback is subject to certain terms and conditions, including
    a condition to the effect that, at the time of entering into the
    sale and leaseback of a particular Boeing

737-800

aircraft, American has at least a certain amount of unrestricted
    cash and short term investments.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding
    $460 million principal amount of its 6.25 percent
    senior convertible notes due 2014. Each note is convertible by
    holders into shares of AMR common stock at an initial conversion
    rate of 101.0101 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
    notes (which represents an equivalent initial conversion price
    of approximately $9.90 per share), subject to adjustment upon
    the occurrence of certain events, at any time prior to the close
    of business on the business day immediately preceding the
    maturity date of the notes. The Company must pay the conversion
    price of the notes in common stock. If the holders of the notes
    do not convert prior to maturity, the Company will retire the
    debt in cash. These notes are guaranteed by American.

Certain of the Company’s debt financing agreements contain
    loan to value ratio covenants and require the Company to
    periodically appraise the collateral. Pursuant to such
    agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified
    threshold, we may be required to subject additional qualifying
    collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral) or,
    in the alternative, to pay down such financing, in whole or in
    part, with premium (if any).

Almost all of the Company’s aircraft assets (including
    aircraft eligible for the benefits of Section 1110 of the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code) are encumbered.

Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were
    $735 million, $631 million and $685 million for
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Financial
    Instruments and Risk Management

Fuel Price Risk Management

As part of the
    Company’s risk management program, it uses a variety of
    financial instruments, primarily heating oil option and collar
    contracts, as cash flow hedges to mitigate commodity price risk.
    The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
    instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2010,
    the Company had fuel derivative contracts outstanding covering
    31 million barrels of jet fuel that will be settled over
    the next 24 months. A deterioration of the Company’s
    liquidity position may negatively affect the Company’s
    ability to hedge fuel in the future.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company assesses, both at
    the inception of each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged
    items. Derivatives that meet the requirements are granted
    special hedge accounting treatment, and the Company’s
    hedges generally meet these requirements. Accordingly, the
    Company’s fuel derivative contracts are accounted for as
    cash flow hedges, and the fair value of the Company’s
    hedging contracts is recorded in Current Assets or Current
    Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
    until the underlying jet fuel is purchased. The Company
    determines the ineffective portion of its fuel hedge contracts
    by comparing the cumulative change in the total value of the
    fuel hedge contract, or group of fuel hedge contracts, to the
    cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel hedge. If the total
    cumulative change in value of the fuel hedge contract more than
    offsets the total cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel
    hedge, the difference is considered ineffective and is
    immediately recognized as a component of Aircraft fuel expense.
    Effective gains or losses on fuel


AMR
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

hedging contracts are deferred in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings as a
    component of Aircraft fuel expense when the underlying jet fuel
    being hedged is used.

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative
    positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related
    commodities. In assessing effectiveness, the Company uses a
    regression model to determine the correlation of the change in
    prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g., NYMEX
    Heating oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel. The Company
    also monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges’
    market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The
    fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be “highly
    effective” if the R-squared is greater than 80 percent
    and dollar offset correlation is within 80 percent to
    125 percent. The Company discontinues hedge accounting
    prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer
    expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to
    discontinue the hedging relationship. Subsequently, any changes
    in the fair value of these derivatives are marked to market
    through earnings in the period of change.

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company recognized net gains (losses) of approximately
    ($142) million, ($651) million and $380 million,
    respectively, as a component of Aircraft fuel expense on the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to
    its fuel hedging agreements, including the ineffective portion
    of the hedges. The fair value of the Company’s fuel hedging
    agreements at December 31, 2010 and 2009, representing the
    amount the Company would receive upon termination of the
    agreements, totaled $257 million and $57 million,
    respectively, which excludes a payable for both years related to
    contracts that settled in December of each year. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company estimates that during the
    next twelve months it will reclassify from Accumulated other
    comprehensive loss into earnings approximately $121 million
    in net gains (based on prices as of December 31,
    2010) related to its fuel derivative hedges.

The impact of cash flow hedges on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements for the years ending
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is depicted below

The Company is also exposed to credit losses in the event of

    contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date,
    reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. To manage
    credit risks, the Company selects counterparties based on credit
    ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under
    defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the
    program and its relative market position with each counterparty.

    collateral of $73 million which is included in short-term
    investments.

In addition to the Company’s qualifying cash flow hedges,
    American has hedges that were effectively unwound in 2009 that
    were recorded as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
    Fair value of these offsetting positions not designated as
    hedges as of December 31, 2009 was a $9 million asset
    recorded in Fuel derivative contracts and a $9 million
    liability recorded in Fuel derivative liability. In January
    2010, all of these contracts were settled with a net zero impact
    to the Company’s financial statements.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair
    values of the Company’s long-term debt were estimated using

The change in the valuation allowance reflects the recording by
    the Company in 2010 and 2009 of an income tax expense credit of
    approximately $30 million and $36 million,
    respectively, resulting from the Company’s elections under
    applicable sections of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance
    Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 and the Housing
    and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009), allowing corporations to
    accelerate utilization of certain research and alternative
    minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable
    bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.

In addition to the changes in the valuation allowance from
    operations described in the table above, the valuation allowance
    was also impacted by the changes in the components of
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), described in
    Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. The total
    increase in the valuation allowance was $121 million,
    $135 million, and $2.1 billion in 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively.

The Company recorded a $248 million non-cash income tax
    benefit from continuing operations during the fourth quarter of
    2009. Under current accounting rules, the Company is required to
    consider all items (including items recorded in other
    comprehensive income) in determining the amount of tax benefit
    that results from a loss from continuing operations and that
    should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, the
    Company recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing
    operations for the year, which will be exactly offset by income
    tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the
    income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the
    income statement, the income tax expense on other comprehensive
    income is recorded directly to Accumulated other comprehensive
    income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity.
    Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is
    equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, the
    Company’s year-end net deferred tax position is not
    impacted by this tax allocation.

The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax
    assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all

    the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management
    considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion,

At December 31, 2010, the Company had available for federal
    income tax purposes an alternative minimum tax credit
    carryforward of approximately $392 million, which is
    available for an indefinite period, and federal net operating
    losses of approximately $6.7 billion for regular tax
    purposes, which will expire, if unused, beginning in 2022. These
    net operating losses include an unrealized benefit of
    approximately $666 million related to the implementation of
    share-based compensation accounting guidance that will be
    recorded in equity when realized. The Company had available for
    state income tax purposes net operating losses of
    $3.7 billion, which expire, if unused, in years 2011
    through 2027. The amount that will expire in 2011 is
    $25 million.

Cash payments (refunds) for income taxes were
    ($32) million, $6 million and $(14) million for
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Under special tax rules (the Section 382 Limitation),
    cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders
    exceeding 50 percent during a

3-year

period can potentially limit a company’s future use of net
    operating losses and tax credits (NOLs). The Section 382
    Limitation may be increased by certain “built-in

Share
    Based Compensation

AMR grants, or has granted, stock compensation under three
    plans: the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 1998 Plan), the
    2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the 2003 Plan) and the 2009
    Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). Collectively, the 1998
    Plan and the 2009 Plan are referred to as the LTIP Plans.

Under the LTIP Plans, officers and key employees of AMR and its
    subsidiaries may be granted certain types of stock or
    performance based awards. At December 31, 2010, the Company
    had stock option awards, stock appreciation right (SAR) awards,
    performance share awards, deferred share awards and other awards
    outstanding under these plans. The total number of common shares
    authorized for distribution under the 1998 Plan and the 2009
    Plan is 23,700,000 and 4,000,000 shares, respectively. The
    1998 Plan expired by its terms in 2008.

The Company established the 2003 Plan to provide equity awards
    to employees. Under the 2003 Plan, employees may be granted
    stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had stock options and
    deferred awards outstanding under this plan. The total number of
    shares authorized for distribution under the 2003 Plan is
    42,680,000 shares.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008 the total charge for share-based
    compensation expense included in Wages, salaries and benefits
    expense was $53 million, $61 million and
    $53 million, respectively. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    amount of cash used to settle equity instruments granted under
    share-based compensation plans was $2 million,
    $1 million and $24 million, respectively.

Stock Options/SARs

During 2006, the AMR Board
    of Directors approved an amendment covering all of the
    outstanding stock options previously granted under the 1998
    Plan. The amendment added to each of the outstanding options an
    additional SAR in tandem with each of the then outstanding stock
    options. The addition of the SAR did not impact the fair value
    of the stock options, but simply allowed the Company to settle
    the exercise of the option by issuing the net number of shares
    equal to the

in-the-money

value of the option. This amendment is estimated to make
    available enough shares to permit the Company to settle all
    outstanding performance and deferred share awards under the 1998
    Plan in stock rather than cash.

Options/SARs granted under the LTIP Plans and the 2003 Plan are
    awarded with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
    the stock on date of grant, become exercisable in equal annual
    installments over periods ranging from three to five years and
    expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. Expense
    for the options is recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair
    value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using the
    modified Black-Scholes option valuation model and the
    assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities
    are based on implied volatilities from traded options on the
    Company’s stock, historical volatility of the
    Company’s stock, and other factors. The Company uses
    historical employee exercise data to estimate the expected term
    of awards granted used in the valuation model. The risk-free
    rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at
    the time of grant. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero
    based on the Company’s history and expectation of not
    paying dividends.

    options/SARs granted under the LTIP Plans and the 2003 Plan that
    is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    3.4 years. The total fair value of stock options/SARs
    vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, was $11 million, $10 million and
    $9 million, respectively.

Cash received by the Company from exercise of stock options for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, was
    $1 million for each of those years. No tax benefit was
    realized as a result of stock options/SARs exercised in 2010 due
    to the tax valuation allowance discussed in Note 8.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share
    awards are granted under the LTIP Plans, generally vest pursuant
    to a three year measurement period and are settled on the
    vesting date. The number of awards ultimately issued under
    performance share awards is contingent on AMR’s relative
    stock price performance compared to certain of its competitors
    over a three year period and can range from zero to
    175 percent of the awards granted. The

fair value of performance awards is calculated by multiplying
    the stock price on the date of grant by the expected payout

    value of the Company’s common stock at December 31,
    2010. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of
    performance share awards granted during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was

    related to performance share awards that is expected to be
    recognized over a period of 1.7 years.

Deferred Share Awards

The distribution of
    deferred share awards granted under the LTIP Plans is based
    solely on a requisite service period (generally 36 months).
    Career equity awards granted to certain employees of the Company
    vest upon the retirement of those individuals. The fair value of

Other Awards

As of December 31, 2010,
    certain performance share agreements and deferred share award
    agreements were accounted for as a liability, or as equity, as
    appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheet as the plans only
    permit settlement in cash or the awards required that the
    employee meet certain performance conditions which were not
    subject to market measurement. As a result, awards under these

Retirement
    Benefits

All employees of the Company may participate in pension plans if
    they meet the plans’ eligibility requirements. The defined
    benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees based
    on years of service and average compensation for a specified
    period of time before retirement. The Company uses a December 31
    measurement date for all of its defined benefit plans.
    American’s pilots also participate in a defined
    contribution plan for which Company contributions are determined
    as a percentage (11 percent) of participant compensation.
    Certain non-contract employees (including all new non-contract
    employees) participate in a defined contribution plan in which
    the Company will match the employees’ before-tax
    contribution on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis, up to 5.5 percent of their pensionable pay.

In addition to pension benefits, retiree medical and other
    postretirement benefits, including certain health care and life
    insurance benefits (which provide secondary coverage to
    Medicare), are provided to retired employees. The amount of
    health care benefits is limited to lifetime maximums as outlined
    in the plan. Certain employees of American and employees of
    certain other subsidiaries may become eligible for these
    benefits if they satisfy eligibility requirements during their
    working lives.

Certain employee groups make contributions toward funding a
    portion of their retiree health care benefits during their
    working lives. The Company funds benefits as incurred and makes
    contributions to match employee prefunding.

    the pension and retiree medical and other benefit obligations

As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s estimate of the
    long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.50 percent
    based on the target asset allocation. Expected returns on longer
    duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held
    at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are based on a
    combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on
    plan assets achieved over the last ten years, current and
    expected market conditions, and expected value to be generated
    through active management, currency overlay and securities
    lending programs. The Company’s annualized ten-year rate of
    return on plan assets as of December 31, 2010, was
    approximately 7.74 percent.

The objectives of the Company’s investment policies are to:
    maintain sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement
    benefits; produce a long-term rate of return that meets or
    exceeds the assumed rate of return for plan assets; limit the
    volatility of asset performance and funded status; and diversify
    assets among asset classes and investment managers.


AMR
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Based on these investment objectives, a long-term strategic
    asset allocation has been established. This strategic allocation
    seeks to balance the potential benefit of improving funded
    position with the potential risk that the funded position would
    decline. The current strategic target asset allocation is as
    follows:

Asset Class/Sub-Class

Allowed Range

Equity

60% - 70%

Public:

U.S. Value

18% - 33%

International Value

14% - 24%

Emerging Markets

5% - 11%

Alternative Investments

0% - 18%

Fixed Income

30% - 40%

U.S. Long Duration

30% - 40%

Other

0% - 5%

Cash Equivalents

0% - 5%

Each asset class is actively managed and, historically, the
    plans’ assets have produced returns, net of management
    fees, in excess of the expected rate of return over the last ten
    years. Stocks and emerging market bonds are used to provide
    diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over
    the long-term than longer duration U.S. bonds. Public
    stocks are managed using a value investment approach in order to
    participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long-term,
    while reducing

year-over-year

volatility. Longer duration U.S. bonds are used to
    partially hedge the assets from declines in interest rates.
    Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected
    returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term.
    Additionally, the Company engages currency overlay managers in
    an attempt to increase returns by protecting

non-U.S. dollar

denominated assets from a rise in the relative value of the
    U.S. dollar. The Company also participates in securities
    lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan
    assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis. These
    programs are subject to market risk.

Investments in securities traded on recognized securities
    exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on the
    last business day of the year. Securities traded in the

over-the-counter

market are valued at the last bid price. The money market fund
    is valued at fair value which represents the net asset value of
    the shares of such fund as of the close of business at the end
    of the period. Investments in limited partnerships are carried
    at estimated net asset value as determined by and reported by
    the general partners of the partnerships and represent the
    proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the
    underlying assets of the limited partnerships. Common/collective
    trusts are valued at net asset value based on the fair values of
    the underlying investments of the trusts as determined by the
    sponsor of the trusts. The

103-12

investment trust is valued at net asset value which is
    determined by the issuer at the end of each month and is based
    on the aggregate fair value of trust assets less liabilities,
    divided by the number of units outstanding. No changes in
    valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the period.

The Company is required to make minimum contributions to its

    requirements of ERISA, the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004
    and the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Company estimates
    its 2011 required contribution to its defined benefit pension
    plans to be approximately $520 million under the provisions
    of these acts which reflects the Preservation of Access to Care
    for Medical Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (the
    Relief Act), H.R. 3962. The Relief Act provides for

temporary, targeted funding relief (subject to certain terms and
    conditions) for single employer and multiemployer pension plans
    that suffered significant losses in asset value due to the steep
    market slide in 2008. Under the Relief Act, the Company’s
    2010 minimum required contribution to its defined benefit
    pension plans was reduced from $525 million to
    approximately $460 million

During 2008, AMR recorded a settlement charge totaling
    $103 million related to lump sum distributions from the
    Company’s defined benefit pension plans to pilots who
    retired. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, the use of settlement
    accounting is required if, for a given year, the cost of all
    settlements exceeds, or is expected to exceed, the sum of the
    service cost and interest cost components of net periodic
    pension expense for a plan. Under settlement accounting,
    unrecognized plan gains or losses must be recognized immediately
    in proportion to the percentage reduction of the plan’s
    projected benefit obligation.

Intangible
    Assets

The Company has recorded international slot and route
    authorities of $708 million and $736 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company
    considers these assets indefinite life assets and as a result,
    they are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment
    annually or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Such
    triggering events may include significant changes to the
    Company’s network or capacity, or the implementation of
    open skies agreements in countries where the Company operates
    flights.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company performed its annual
    impairment testing on international slots and routes, at which
    time the net carrying value was reassessed for recoverability.
    It was determined through this annual impairment testing that
    the fair value of certain international routes in Latin America
    was less than the carrying value. Thus, the Company incurred an
    impairment charge of $28 million to write down the values
    of these and certain other slots and routes.

As there is minimal market activity for the valuation of routes
    and international slots and landing rights, the Company measures
    fair value with inputs using the income approach. The income
    approach uses valuation techniques, such as future cash flows,
    to convert future amounts to a single present discounted amount.
    The inputs utilized for these valuations are unobservable and
    reflect the Company’s assumptions about market participants
    and what they would use to value the routes and accordingly are
    considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The
    Company’s unobservable inputs are developed based on the
    best information available as of December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company estimates that during
    the next twelve months it will reclassify from Accumulated other
    comprehensive loss into earnings approximately $121 million
    in net gains (based on prices as of December 31,
    2010) related to its fuel derivative hedges.

The difference between Net earnings (loss) and other
    comprehensive income (loss) for the twelve month periods ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 is due primarily to the
    accounting for the Company’s derivative financial
    instruments and the actuarial loss on the pension benefit
    obligation of the Company’s pension plans.

Amounts allocated to other comprehensive income for income taxes
    as further described in Note 8 will remain in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income until the Company ceases all related
    activities, such as termination of the pension plan.

Segment
    Reporting

The Company’s operations of American and AMR Eagle are
    treated as an integrated route network and the route scheduling
    system maximizes the operating results of the Company. The
    Company’s chief operating decision maker makes resource
    allocation decisions to maximize the Company’s consolidated
    financial results. Based on the way the Company treats the
    network and the manner in which resource allocation decisions
    are made, the Company has only one operating segment for
    financial reporting purposes consisting of the operations of
    American and AMR Eagle.

American, AMR Eagle and the
    AmericanConnection

®

airline serve more than 250 cities in approximately
    50 countries with, on average, 3,400 daily flights. The
    combined network fleet numbers approximately 900 aircraft.
    American is also one of the largest scheduled air freight
    carriers in the world, providing a wide range of freight and
    mail services to shippers throughout its system onboard
    American’s passenger fleet. AMR Eagle owns two regional
    airlines, which do business as “American
    Eagle” — American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and
    Executive Airlines, Inc. The American
    Eagle

®

carriers provide service from throughout the U.S., Canada,
    Mexico and the Caribbean.

Revenues from other segments are below the quantitative
    threshold for determining reportable segments and consist
    primarily of revenues from American Beacon Advisors, Inc.
    (divested in 2008) and Americas Ground Services, Inc. The
    difference between the financial information of the
    Company’s one reportable segment and the financial
    information included in the accompanying consolidated statements
    of operations and balance sheets as a result of these entities
    is not material.

    leaseback of certain aircraft and the grounding of leased Airbus
    A300 aircraft prior to lease expiration.

The results for the fourth quarter of 2009 include an impairment
    charge of approximately $138 million to write down certain
    route and slot authorities, primarily in Latin America, and
    certain Embraer RJ-135 aircraft to their estimated fair values,
    as well as $30 million in charges associated with the
    grounding of the Airbus A300 fleet and the sale leaseback of
    certain aircraft. Also included in 2009 results is a
    $248 million non-cash tax benefit resulting from the
    allocation of the tax expense to other comprehensive income
    items recognized during 2009.

The first quarter 2010 results include a loss of
    $53 million related to a currency remeasurement due to the
    devaluation of Venezuelan currency from 2.15 bolivars per
    U.S. dollar to 4.30 bolivars per U.S. dollar.

The Company’s fourth quarter 2010 performance includes an
    impairment charge of approximately $28 million to write

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Management’s
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. This
    term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. An
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures as of December 31, 2010. Based on that
    evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and
    CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010. During
    the quarter ending on December 31, 2010, there was no
    change in the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
    to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 using the criteria set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that,
    as of December 31, 2010, the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting was effective based on those
    criteria.

The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010, has been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm who also audited the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. Ernst & Young LLP’s
    attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting appears below.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

AMR Corporation

We have audited AMR Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). AMR
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    “Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
    upon the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as
    we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
    our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AMR Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of AMR Corporation as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit)
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 of AMR Corporation and our report dated
    February 16, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
