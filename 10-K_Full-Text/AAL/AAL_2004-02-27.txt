PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October 1982. AMR’s
operations fall almost entirely in the airline industry. AMR’s principal
subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines), was founded in 1934.
On April 9, 2001, American Airlines (through a wholly owned subsidiary, TWA
Airlines LLC (TWA LLC)) purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed
certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), the eighth largest
U.S. carrier. American Airlines, including TWA LLC (collectively, American),
is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2003,
American provided scheduled jet service to approximately 150 destinations
throughout North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific.
American is also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the
world, providing a wide range of freight and mail services to shippers
throughout its system.

In addition, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AMR, owns two regional airlines, which do business as “American
Eagle” — American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc.
(Executive) (collectively, the American Eagle carriers). American also
contracts with three independently owned regional airlines, which do business
as the “American Connection” (the American Connection carriers). The American
Eagle carriers and the American Connection carriers provide connecting service
from eight of American’s high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the
United States, Canada and the Caribbean.

AMR Investment Services, Inc. (AMR Investment), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
AMR, is responsible for the investment and oversight of assets of AMR’s
employee benefit plans, as well as its short-term investments. It also serves
as the investment manager of the American AAdvantage Funds, a family of mutual
funds with both institutional and retail shareholders, and provides customized
fixed income portfolio management services. As of December 31, 2003, AMR
Investment was responsible for management of approximately $30.2 billion in
assets, including direct management of approximately $14.3 billion in
short-term fixed income investments.

A. Recent Events

The events of the past several years have had a material adverse impact on the
Company’s finances. The Company incurred operating losses of $0.8 billion,
$3.3 billion and $2.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The Company incurred net losses of $1.2 billion, $3.5
billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

These losses reflect, among other things, a substantial decrease in the
Company’s revenues, which began in early 2001. The revenue decrease has been
driven by a number of factors, some of which the Company believes will persist
indefinitely or permanently. These factors include: (i) a steep fall-off in
the demand for air travel, particularly business travel, primarily caused by
weakness in the U.S. economy, (ii) reduced pricing power, resulting mainly from
greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers, especially business
travelers, increasing competition from low-cost carriers (LCCs) and the
continuing increase in pricing transparency resulting from the use of the
Internet and (iii) the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, which accelerated and exacerbated the trend of decreased demand and
reduced industry revenues.

In response to decreased demand following the events of September 11, 2001, the
Company reduced its operating schedule by approximately 20 percent and reduced
its workforce by approximately 20,000 jobs. Subsequent to these reductions, the
Company determined that achieving $4 billion in annual capacity-independent
cost savings was necessary to offset the revenue decline and initiated the
following restructuring activities to realize this goal:

•

In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its
annual costs by $2 billion. These initiatives are being implemented
through 2005, and involve: (i) scheduling efficiencies, including the
de-peaking of certain of its hubs, (ii) fleet simplification, (iii)
streamlined customer interaction, (iv) distribution modifications, (v)
in-flight product changes, (vi) operational changes and (vii)
headquarters/administration efficiencies. As a result of the initiatives,
the Company reduced an estimated 7,000 jobs by March 2003.



•

In February 2003, American asked its employees for approximately $1.8 billion
in annual savings through a combination of changes in wages, benefits and
work rules. In April 2003, American reached agreements with its three unions
and also implemented various changes in the pay plans and benefits for
non-unionized personnel, including officers and other management. In
addition, the Company and American reached concessionary agreements with
certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers (collectively, the Vendors,
and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements), resulting in approximately $200
million in annual cost savings. Generally, under the terms of these Vendor
Agreements, the Company or American receives the benefit of lower rates and
charges for certain goods and services, and more favorable rent and financing
terms with respect to certain of its aircraft.

In the second quarter of 2003, in conjunction with some improvement in the U.S.
economy, the Company’s revenue environment began to improve, as reflected in
higher unit revenues (revenue per available seat mile) in May through December
2003, when compared to May through December 2002, respectively. Even with this
improvement, however, the Company’s revenues remain depressed relative to
historical levels. The Company therefore needs to see continued improvement in
the revenue environment, additional cost reductions and further productivity
improvements before it can return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels.

In 2003, the Company announced the Turnaround Plan, a four tenet plan designed
to achieve sustained profitability.

•

Lower Costs To Compete:

As discussed above, one of the Company’s
critical goals is to reduce costs by $4 billion annually, including $2
billion from strategic initiatives, $1.8 billion from labor cost
savings and $200 million from vendors, suppliers and creditors.
Progress toward this goal helped the Company achieve a significant
year-over-year decline in costs per available seat mile in the fourth
quarter of 2003 and in 2003 as a whole. If not for rising fuel prices,
the Company’s progress in reducing costs would have been even more
significant. The Company has returned underused gate space,
consolidated terminal space, de-peaked its Chicago and Dallas/Fort
Worth hub schedules (with its Miami hub to be de-peaked in 2004),
closed a reservations center, reduced the size of its St. Louis hub,
accelerated the retirement of certain aircraft, and improved aircraft
utilization across its fleet.

•

Fly Smart, Give Customers What They Value:

This tenet focuses on
customer service and revenue production, with emphasis on improving
the Company’s relative revenue performance compared to others in the
airline industry. Actions in this area include adding seats to
American’s Boeing 757 and Airbus A300 fleets and restructuring the
hubs at Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth and St. Louis. Another step is
expanding alliances. The Company’s progress includes a domestic
codeshare with Alaska Airlines, governmental approval of codesharing
with British Airways, the addition of SWISS International to the

one

world alliance, and the recently announced codeshare linkage with
Mexicana (which, subject to governmental approvals, will be launched
in April 2004).

•

Pull Together, Win Together:

Fostering greater cooperation than ever
with employees, the Company has launched an unprecedented level of
openness with employee groups and labor unions. The Company’s
President and Chief Executive Officer holds regular “Town Hall"-style
meetings with employees, and its Chief Financial Officer meets monthly
with union leaders to discuss the Company’s financial results with
them in much the same way as he briefs AMR’s Board of Directors. In
addition, the Company has engaged a firm that works to bring union
groups and management together, to help to promote a philosophy of
active involvement.

•

Build A Financial Foundation For Our Future:

The Company ended the
fourth quarter of 2003 with $2.6 billion in unrestricted cash and
short-term investments and $527 million in restricted cash and
short-term investments. The Company had $1.3 billion in unrestricted
cash and short-term investments and $550 million in restricted cash
and short-term investments at the close of the first quarter of 2003.
From April 1 to December 31, 2003, cash flows from operations totaled
$1.1 billion. The Company has also been able to sell some non-core
assets, such as its stakes in Worldspan, a computer reservations
company; Hotwire, a discount travel website company; and a portion of
its stake in Orbitz, a travel planning website.



The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations,
including capital expenditures and commitments. However, to
maintain sufficient liquidity over the long-term as the Company continues to implement the
Turnaround Plan and seeks to return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels, the Company will need continued access to additional funding. In
addition, the Company’s ability to return to sustained profitability at
acceptable levels will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are
largely beyond the Company’s control. Some of the risk factors that have had
and/or may have a negative impact on the Company’s business and financial
results are discussed in Risk Factors under Item 7. In particular, if the
revenue environment deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the Company
is unable to access the capital markets, it may be unable to fund its
obligations and sustain its operations in the long-term.

B. Competition

Major Competitors

The domestic airline industry is fiercely competitive.
Currently, any U.S. air carrier deemed fit by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any
two points within the U.S. and its possessions. Most major air carriers have
developed hub-and-spoke systems and schedule patterns in an effort to maximize
the revenue potential of their service. American operates five hubs:
Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago O’Hare, Miami, St. Louis and San Juan, Puerto
Rico. Delta Air Lines (Delta) and United Air Lines (United) also have hub
operations at DFW and Chicago O’Hare, respectively. The American Eagle carriers
increase the number of markets the Company serves by providing connections at
American’s hubs and certain other major airports — Boston, Los Angeles,
Raleigh/Durham and New York’s LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International
Airports. The American Connection carriers provide connecting service to
American through St. Louis. American’s competitors also own or have marketing
agreements with regional carriers which provide similar services at their major
hubs and other locations.

On most of its domestic non-stop routes, the Company faces competing service
from at least one, and sometimes more than one domestic airline including:
AirTran Airways, Alaska Airlines, America West Airlines, ATA Airlines,
Continental Airlines (Continental), Delta, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways,
Northwest Airlines (Northwest), Southwest Airlines, United and US Airways, and
their affiliated regional carriers. Competition is even greater between cities
that require a connection, where the major airlines may compete via their
respective hubs. In addition, the Company faces competition on some of its
routes from carriers operating point-to-point service on such routes. The
Company also competes with all-cargo and charter carriers and, particularly on
shorter segments, ground transportation. On all of its routes, pricing
decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from
other airlines.

International Air Transportation

In addition to its extensive domestic
service, the Company provides international service to the Caribbean, Canada,
Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. The Company’s operating revenues from
foreign operations were approximately 27 percent of the Company’s total
operating revenues in 2003 and 28 percent of the Company’s total operating
revenues in 2002 and 2001. Additional information about the Company’s foreign
operations is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

In providing international air transportation, the Company competes with
foreign investor-owned carriers, state-owned carriers and U.S. airlines that
have been granted authority to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service
between the U.S. and various overseas locations. The major U.S. air carriers
have some advantage over foreign competitors in their ability to generate
traffic from their extensive domestic route systems. In many cases, however,
foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to carry passengers beyond
designated gateway cities in foreign countries. To improve access to each
other’s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers — including American -
have established marketing relationships with other airlines and rail
companies. American currently has marketing relationships with Aer Lingus, Air
Pacific, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific,
China Eastern Airlines, Deutsche Bahn, EL AL, EVA Air, Finnair, Gulf Air,
Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LanChile, Mexicana (planned launch
in April 2004, subject to governmental approvals), Qantas Airways, SN Brussels,
SNCF, Southern Winds, Swiss International Air Lines, TACA Group, the TAM Group,
Thalys and Turkish Airlines. In the coming years, the Company expects to
develop these programs further and to evaluate new alliances with other
carriers.



American is also a founding member of the

one

world alliance, which includes Aer
Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, LanChile, Iberia, and Qantas.
On September 23, 2003, the alliance announced its intention for Swiss
International Air Lines to join

one

world in 2004. The

one

world alliance links
the networks of the member carriers to enhance customer service and smooth
connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the
carriers’ frequent flyer programs and access to the carriers’ airport lounge
facilities. Several of American’s major competitors are members of
marketing/operational alliances that enjoy antitrust immunity. To the extent
that American and British Airways, the largest members of the

one

world
alliance, are restricted in their relationship because they lack antitrust
immunity, the carriers are at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other
alliances that have antitrust immunity. On May 30, 2003, the DOT finalized an
order giving American and British Airways permission to codeshare on a wide
number of flights beyond the carriers’ gateways in the United Kingdom and the
United States. On September 17, 2003, the carriers implemented their first
phase of codeshare services and plan to expand this cooperation further in
2004.

Price Competition

The airline industry is characterized by substantial price
competition. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative
effect on the Company’s financial results because the Company is generally
required to match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic. During
recent years, a number of new LCCs have entered the domestic market and several
major airlines, including the Company, have implemented efforts to lower their
costs. In addition, several air carriers have recently reorganized or are
reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including
United and US Airways. In the past, air carriers involved in reorganizations
have undertaken substantial fare discounting in order to maintain cash flows
and enhance customer loyalty. Further fare reductions, domestic and
international, may therefore occur in the future. If fare reductions are not
offset by increases in passenger traffic, changes in the mix of traffic that
improve yields (passenger revenue per passenger mile) and/or cost reductions,
the Company’s operating results will be negatively impacted.

Distribution Systems

The growing use of electronic ticket distribution
systems provides the Company with an opportunity to lower its distribution
costs. However, the continuous increase in pricing transparency resulting from
use of the Internet has enabled cost-conscious customers to more easily obtain
the lowest fare on any given route. The Company continues to expand the
capabilities of its Internet website — AA.com — and the use of electronic
ticketing throughout the Company’s network. In addition, the Company, along
with United, Continental, Delta and Northwest, owns an interest in Orbitz, a
travel planning website. Orbitz provides online access to airline, hotel, car
rental and other travel services. The Company also has marketing agreements
with other Internet travel services.

The majority of the tickets for travel on American and American Eagle are sold
by travel agents. On March 18, 2002, American announced that it would no longer
pay base commissions on tickets issued by travel agents in the United States,
Puerto Rico, and Canada (which generally were five percent of the price of a
ticket, capped at a maximum of $20 for a domestic roundtrip itinerary and $100
for an international roundtrip). As discussed in Item 3 Legal Proceedings, the
Company is subject to legal challenges related to these changes. American
continues, however, to pay certain commissions to travel agents in connection
with special revenue programs. American believes that other domestic carriers
also no longer pay base commissions on tickets issued by travel agents in the
U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, but pay certain commissions in connection with
their own special revenue programs. Accordingly, airlines compete, not only
with respect to the price of the tickets sold, but also with respect to the
amount of special revenue program commissions that may be paid.

C. Regulation

General

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most
domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation. However,
the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still exercise certain
regulatory authority over air carriers. The DOT maintains jurisdiction over
the approval of international codeshare agreements, international route
authorities and certain consumer protection and unfair competition matters,
such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.



The FAA regulates flying operations generally, including establishing
personnel, aircraft and certain security standards. As part of that oversight,
the FAA has implemented a number of requirements that the Company is
incorporating into its maintenance programs. In 2003, the Company completed
modifications to improve flight deck security on all fleet types. The Company
is progressing toward the completion of over 100 airworthiness directives
including McDonnell Douglas MD-80 metal-mylar insulation replacement, enhanced
ground proximity warning systems, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 main landing gear
piston improvements, Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 pylon improvements, Boeing 737
elevator and rudder improvements, inspections to monitor Airbus A300 vertical
stabilizers and Airbus A300 structural improvements. Based on its current
implementation schedule, the Company expects to be in compliance with the
applicable requirements within the required time periods.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) has jurisdiction over airline antitrust
matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the
transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air
transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests
in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain regulatory functions with respect
to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation
and collective bargaining agreements.

International

International air transportation is subject to extensive
government regulation. The Company’s operating authority in international
markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective
countries or governments, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the
approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover,
alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and
regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral agreements between the U.S.
and various foreign governments of countries served by the Company are
periodically subject to renegotiation. Changes in U.S. or foreign government
aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such
agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, or otherwise adversely
affect the Company’s international operations. In addition, at some foreign
airports, an air carrier needs slots (landing and take-off authorizations)
before the air carrier can introduce new service or increase existing service.
The availability of such slots is not assured and the inability of the Company
to obtain and retain needed slots could therefore inhibit its efforts to
compete in certain international markets.

Security

In November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA)
was enacted. The ATSA created a new government agency, the Transportation
Security Administration (TSA), which is part of the Department of Homeland
Security and is responsible for aviation security. The ATSA mandates that the
TSA provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including U.S.
mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be
carried aboard a passenger aircraft. The ATSA also provides for increased
security in flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be
present on certain flights.

Effective February 1, 2002, the ATSA imposed a $2.50 per enplanement security
service fee ($5 one-way maximum fee), which is being collected by the air
carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security
measures. Additionally, for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, air carriers are
required to submit to the government an amount equal to what the air carriers
paid for screening passengers and property in 2000. After 2004, this fee may
be assessed based upon some other allocation. The Emergency Wartime
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 temporarily suspended the collection of
these fees from June 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003.

In addition, the ATSA requires air carriers to honor tickets for suspended
service on other air carriers that are insolvent or have declared bankruptcy
within 18 months of the passage of the ATSA. The Vision 100 — Century of
Aviation Reauthorization Act, enacted in December 2003, extends this provision
to 36 months after the passage of the ATSA. To be eligible, a passenger must
make arrangements with the air carrier within 60 days after the date on which
the passenger’s air transportation was suspended. This feature of the ATSA
could have a significant impact on the Company. If the Company is not
reimbursed for honoring such tickets, the impact could be adverse.

Airline Fares

Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares
without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over international
fares, rates and charges. In addition, international fares and rates are
sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign
countries which the Company serves. While air carriers are required to file
and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions,
overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize
many international markets.



Airport Access

The FAA has designated New York John F. Kennedy, New York
LaGuardia, and Washington Reagan airports as high-density traffic airports.
The high-density rule limits the number of Instrument Flight Rule operations —
take-offs and landings — permitted per hour and requires that a slot support
each operation. In April 2000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and
Reform Act for the 21st Century (Air 21 Act) was enacted. It will eliminate
slot restrictions at New York John F. Kennedy and New York LaGuardia airports
in 2007. The Company does not expect the elimination of these slot
restrictions will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations,
or its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Currently, the FAA permits the purchasing, selling, leasing or transferring of
slots except those slots designated as international, essential air service or
Air 21 Act slots. Trading of any domestic slot is permitted subject to certain
parameters. Most foreign airports, including London Heathrow, a major European
destination for American, also have slot allocations. Most foreign authorities
do not permit the purchasing, selling or leasing of slots.

Although the Company is constrained by slots, it currently has sufficient slot
authorizations to operate its existing flights and has generally been able to
obtain slots to expand its operations and change its schedules. However, there
is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain slots for these
purposes in the future because, among other factors, slot allocations are
subject to changes in government policies.

In January 2004, American reached an agreement with the FAA whereby it agreed
to reduce operations at Chicago O’Hare during certain peak times. The FAA
announced that a similar agreement between the FAA and United was reached.
American does not anticipate that this agreement with the FAA will have any
material impact on its operations.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to various laws and government
regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in
the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact
on the Company include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the
Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act,
the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act). The Company is
also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have
been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on the Company’s
operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been
delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many
state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and
health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to or stricter than
federal requirements.

The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to
implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere
unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air
transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft
noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The
ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft.
While the Company has had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate
local noise restrictions imposed to date, the Company’s operations could be
adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or
widespread.

American has been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for
contamination at the Double Eagle Superfund Site in Oklahoma City, OK.
American’s alleged volumetric contributions are small when compared with those
of other PRPs. American is participating with a number of other PRPs in a
Joint Defense Group that is actively conducting settlement negotiations with
EPA and state officials. The group is seeking a settlement on behalf of its
members that will enable American to resolve its past and present liabilities
at the Site in exchange for a one-time, lump-sum settlement payment. American
expects that its payment will be immaterial.

American, along with most other tenants at the San Francisco International
Airport (SFIA), has been ordered by the California Regional Water Quality
Control Board to engage in various studies of potential environmental
contamination at the airport and to undertake remedial measures, if necessary.
SFIA is also seeking to recover its past costs related to the contamination
from the tenants. American’s potential contribution is unknown, but is not
expected to be material.



Miami-Dade County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating
various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and
funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery
methods. American and AMR Eagle have been named PRPs for the contamination at
MIA. During the second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against 17
defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover its past and future
cleanup costs (

Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo Services, Inc., et
al.

in the Florida Circuit Court). In addition to the 17 defendants named in
the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and
contributors to the contamination. American’s and AMR Eagle’s portion of the
cleanup costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including
the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the proportion
of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and
uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately
supervise the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. The
Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

In 1999, American was ordered by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC) to conduct remediation of environmental contamination
located at Terminals 8 and 9 at New York’s John F. Kennedy International
Airport (JFK). American is seeking to recover a portion of the remediation
costs from previous users of the Terminals 8 and 9 premises. In 2002, American
began negotiating an order with NYSDEC for the remediation of a JFK
off-terminal hangar facility. American does not expect the costs associated
with this remediation to be material.

In 1996, American and Executive, along with other tenants at the Luis Munoz
Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico were notified by the Port
Authority that it considered them potentially responsible for environmental
contamination at the airport. In 2003, the Port Authority requested that
American, among other airport tenants, fund an ongoing subsurface investigation
and site assessment. American denied liability for the related costs. No
further action has been taken against American or Executive.

American Eagle Airlines, Inc. has been notified of its potential liability
under New York law at an inactive hazardous waste site in Poughkeepsie, New
York. Pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent entered into with NYSDEC,
American Eagle is implementing a final remedy to address contamination at the
site. The costs of this final remedy are not material.

The Company does not expect these matters, individually or collectively, to
have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

D. Labor

The airline business is labor intensive. Wages, salaries and benefits
represented approximately 40 percent of the Company’s consolidated operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003. The average equivalent number
of employees of the Company’s subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2003
was 96,400.

The majority of these employees are represented by labor unions and covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Relations with such labor organizations are
governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under this act, the collective bargaining
agreements among the Company’s subsidiaries and these organizations generally
do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either
party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the
other party in the manner described in the agreement. After receipt of such
notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is
reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (NMB) to appoint
a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may
declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the
NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to
submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day
“cooling off” period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential
Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions
and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed
by a “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period,
unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor
organization may strike and the airline may resort to “self-help”, including
the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new
employees to replace the striking workers.



In April 2003, American reached agreements with its three major unions — the
Allied Pilots Association (the APA), the Transport Workers Union of America
(AFL-CIO) (the TWU) and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (the
APFA) (the Labor Agreements). The Labor Agreements substantially reduced the
labor costs associated with the employees represented by the unions. In
conjunction with the Labor Agreements, American implemented various changes in
the pay plans and benefits for non-unionized personnel, including officers and
other management (the Management Reductions). The Labor Agreements will not
become amendable until 2008.

The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents American Eagle pilots,
reached agreement with American Eagle effective September 1, 1997, to have all
of the pilots of the American Eagle carriers covered by a single collective
bargaining agreement. This agreement lasts until October 31, 2013. The
agreement provides to the parties the right to seek limited changes in 2004,
2008 and 2012. If the parties are unable to agree on the limited changes, they
also agreed that the issues would be resolved by interest arbitration, without
the exercise of self-help (such as a strike). ALPA and American Eagle
negotiated a tentative agreement in 2000, but that agreement failed in
ratification. Thereafter, the parties participated in interest arbitration. The
interest arbitration panel determined the limited changes which should be made
and these changes were appropriately effected. The Company expects to begin
negotiations under the agreement in the first quarter of 2004.

The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), which represents the flight
attendants of the American Eagle carriers, reached agreement with American
Eagle effective March 2, 1998, to have all flight attendants of the American
Eagle carriers covered by a single contract. The agreement became amendable on
September 2, 2001. However, the parties agreed to commence negotiations over
amendments to the agreement in March 2001. The mediation assistance of the NMB
was requested and mediation commenced in November 2003; mediated negotiations
continue. The other union employees at the American Eagle carriers are covered
by separate agreements with the TWU, which were effective April 28, 1998, and
were amendable April 28, 2003. American Eagle and the TWU have commenced
negotiations. American Eagle cannot predict the result of the mediation or
these negotiations.

The non-union employees formerly with TWA LLC have been integrated into
American’s work force. With respect to the integration of unionized employees
formerly employed by TWA LLC, American reached integration agreements with the
APA (with respect to pilot integration) and the APFA (with respect to flight
attendant integration). American and the TWU participated in arbitration and
resolved certain unionized ground employee integration issues in late February
and early March 2002. In early April 2002, the NMB declared American and TWA
LLC a single carrier for labor relations purposes and designated American’s
incumbent unions as the collective bargaining representatives of the relevant
work groups at both American and TWA LLC. Since American’s unions thereafter
represented the relevant employees at both carriers, the integration mechanisms
applicable to the unions at American could then begin to be effected. The
integration of the unionized work groups is occurring in accordance with those
mechanisms.

E. Fuel

The Company’s operations and financial results are significantly affected by
the availability and price of jet fuel. The Company’s fuel costs and
consumption for the years 2001 through 2003 were:

The impact of fuel price changes on the Company and its competitors depends on
various factors, including hedging strategies. The Company has a fuel hedging
program in which it enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude oil swap and
option contracts to dampen the impact of the volatility of jet fuel prices.
During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company’s fuel hedging program reduced the
Company’s fuel expense by approximately $149 million, $4 million and $29
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had hedged, with
option contracts, approximately 21 percent of its estimated first quarter 2004
fuel requirements, 16 percent of its second quarter 2004 estimated fuel
requirements and six percent of its estimated fuel requirements for the
remainder of 2004. The Company’s credit rating, as discussed in Liquidity and
Capital Resources under Item 7, has limited its ability to enter into certain
types of fuel hedge contracts. A further deterioration of its credit rating or
liquidity position may negatively affect the Company’s ability to hedge fuel in
the future. See the Risk Factors under Item 7 for information regarding fuel.

Additional information regarding the Company’s fuel program is also included in
Item 7(A) — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and in
Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

F. Frequent Flyer Program

American established the AAdvantage frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) to
develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued
patronage. The Company believes that the AAdvantage program is one of its
competitive strengths. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits for flights on
American, American Eagle and certain other participating airlines, or by using
services of other program participants, including bank credit card issuers,
hotels, car rental companies and phone service companies. American sells
mileage credits and related services to the other companies participating in
the program. American reserves the right to change the AAdvantage program at
any time without notice and end the program with six months notice.

Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel on
American, American Eagle or participating airlines, or for other travel
industry awards. Once a member accrues sufficient mileage for an award, the
member may book award travel on American. Most travel awards are subject to
capacity controlled seating. Mileage credit does not expire, provided a
customer has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 36 months.

American uses the incremental cost method to account for the portion of its
frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits
by flying on American or American Eagle. American’s frequent flyer liability
is accrued each time a member accumulates sufficient mileage in his or her
account to claim the lowest level of free travel award (25,000 miles) and the
award is expected to be used for free travel. American includes fuel, food,
and reservations/ticketing costs in the calculation of incremental cost. These
estimates are generally updated based upon the Company’s 12-month historical
average of such costs. American also accrues a frequent flier liability for
the mileage credits that are expected to be used for travel on participating
airlines.

Revenue earned from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies is recognized
in two components. The first component represents the revenue for air
transportation sold and is valued at current market rates. This revenue is
deferred and recognized over the period the mileage is expected to be used,
which is currently estimated to be 28 months. The second revenue component,
representing the marketing products sold and administrative costs associated
with operating the AAdvantage program, is recognized immediately.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, American estimated that approximately 9.3
million free travel awards were expected to be redeemed for free travel on
American and American Eagle. In making the estimate of free travel awards,
American has excluded mileage in inactive accounts, mileage related to accounts
that have not yet reached the lowest level of free travel award, and mileage in
active accounts that have reached the lowest level of free travel award but
which are not expected to ever be redeemed for free travel on American or
participating airlines. The Company’s total liability for future AAdvantage
award redemptions for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American
Eagle or participating airlines and unrecognized revenue from selling
AAdvantage miles to other companies was approximately $1.2 billion (and is
recorded as a component of Air traffic liability in the consolidated balance
sheets), representing 18.8 percent and 16.2 percent of AMR’s total current
liabilities, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



The number of free travel awards used for travel on American and American Eagle
in 2003 and 2002 was 2.5 million and 2.6 million, respectively, representing
approximately 7.8 percent and 8.1 percent of passengers boarded, respectively.
The Company believes displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given the
Company’s load factors, its ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory,
and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total passengers boarded.

G. Other Matters

Seasonality and Other Factors

The Company’s results of operations for any
interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year,
since the air transportation business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.

The results of operations in the air transportation business have also
significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic
conditions. In addition, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives,
fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather and other factors could
impact this seasonal pattern. Unaudited quarterly financial data for the
two-year period ended December 31, 2003 is included in Note 15 to the
consolidated financial statements.

No material part of the business of AMR and its subsidiaries is dependent upon
a single customer or very few customers. Consequently, the loss of the
Company’s largest few customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon
the Company.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance for public liability, passenger
liability, property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft.

As a result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers significantly
reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers
for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims
resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage).
At the same time, these insurers significantly increased the premiums for
aviation insurance in general.

The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for
U.S. based airlines until August 31, 2004 covering losses to employees,
passengers, third parties and aircraft. In addition, the Secretary of
Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2004, at his
discretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the
U.S. government does not extend the policy beyond August 31, 2004, the Company
will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope from commercial
insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is not available at
commercially reasonable rates, the Company’s results of operations would be
negatively affected. In addition, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the
amount of insurance coverage available to the Company, or significantly
increase its cost, the Company’s operations and/or financial position and
results of operations would be adversely affected.

Other Government Matters

In time of war or during a national emergency or
defense oriented situation, American and other air carriers can be required to
provide airlift services to the Air Mobility Command under the Civil Reserve
Air Fleet program (CRAF). The Air Mobility Command, which runs CRAF, activated
Stage I of CRAF as part of the U.S. government’s build-up for military action
in Iraq during 2003. Stage I of CRAF was in effect from February 8, 2003 until
June 18, 2003. American provided five airplanes, including three 777s and two
767-300s, with crews for Stage I of CRAF, which did not significantly impact
its operations. In the event the Company has to provide a substantial number
of aircraft and crew to the Air Mobility Command, its operations could be
adversely impacted.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company decided to permanently retire its
nine owned Boeing 767-200s and four owned Boeing 767-200ERs, which were
previously in temporary storage. The Company has no plan to return these
aircraft to service and is investigating disposition opportunities.

In addition, in early 2004,
American agreed to sell 18 Fokker 100 aircraft (nine
of which are operating aircraft as of December 31, 2003), with deliveries
beginning in March 2004 and ending in November 2004.

AMR Eagle has leased its 10 owned Embraer 145s not operated by the Company to
Trans States Airlines, Inc.

The Company is actively marketing its remaining owned non-operating aircraft
and does not anticipate bringing these aircraft back into service.

Substantially all of the Company’s aircraft leases include an option to
purchase the aircraft or to extend the lease term, or both, with the purchase
price or renewal rental to be based essentially on the market value of the
aircraft at the end of the term of the lease or at a predetermined fixed
amount.

Ground Properties

The Company leases, or has built as leasehold improvements on leased property:
most of its airport and terminal facilities; its maintenance and training
facilities in Fort Worth, Texas; its principal overhaul and maintenance bases
at Tulsa International Airport (Tulsa, Oklahoma), Kansas City International
Airport (Kansas City, Missouri) and Alliance Airport (Fort Worth, Texas); its
regional reservation offices; and local ticket and administration offices
throughout the system. American has entered into agreements with the Tulsa
Municipal Airport Trust; the Alliance Airport Authority, Fort Worth, Texas; the
New York City Industrial Development Agency; and the Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago
O’Hare, Newark, San Juan, and Los Angeles airport authorities to provide funds
for constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment
which are or will be leased to the Company. The Company also uses public
airports for its flight operations under lease or use arrangements with the
municipalities or governmental agencies owning or controlling them and leases
certain other ground equipment for use at its facilities.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On July 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in November 1999 an
amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc.,
AMR Eagle Holding Corporation, Airlines Reporting Corporation, and the Sabre
Group Holdings, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California, Western Division (

Westways World Travel, Inc. v. AMR
Corp., et al.

). The lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay
debit memos to American for violations of American’s fare rules (by customers
of the agencies): (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American
and AMR Eagle and the plaintiffs; (2) constitutes unjust enrichment; and (3)
violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO).
The certified class includes all travel agencies who have been or will be
required to pay money to American for debit memos for fare rules violations
from July 26, 1995 to the present. The plaintiffs seek to enjoin American from
enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for
debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The Company
intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that
the litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision could impose
restrictions on the Company’s relationships with travel agencies, which could
have an adverse impact on the Company.

On May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and AMR
Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in Wichita, Kansas (

United States v.
AMR Corporation, et al, No. 99-1180-JTM, United States District Court for the
District of Kansas

). The lawsuit alleged that American unlawfully monopolized
or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from Dallas/Fort
Worth International Airport (DFW) by increasing service when new competitors
began flying to DFW, and by matching these new competitors’ fares. The
Department of Justice sought to enjoin American from engaging in the alleged
improper conduct and to impose restraints on American to remedy the alleged
effects of its past conduct. On April 27, 2001, the U.S. District Court for
the District of Kansas granted American’s motion for summary judgment, and on
July 3, 2003, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The Department of
Justice did not seek to have the case reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Between May 14, 1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits were filed
against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and AMR Eagle Holding
Corporation in the United States District Court in Wichita, Kansas seeking
treble damages under federal and state antitrust laws, as well as injunctive
relief and attorneys’ fees (

King v. AMR Corp., et al.

;

Smith v. AMR Corp., et
al.

;

Team Electric v. AMR Corp., et al.

;

Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.

;

Whittier
v. AMR Corp., et al.

;

Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.

; and

Youngdahl v. AMR Corp.,
et al.

). Collectively, these lawsuits allege that American unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from
DFW by increasing service when new competitors began flying to DFW, and by
matching these new competitors’ fares. Two of the suits (

Smith

and

Wright

)
also allege that American unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize
airline passenger service to and from DFW by offering discounted fares to
corporate purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain
conditions on the use and availability of certain fares, and by offering
override commissions to travel agents. The suits propose to certify several
classes of consumers, the broadest of which is all persons who purchased
tickets for air travel on American into or out of DFW from 1995 to the present.
On November 10, 1999, the District Court stayed all of these actions pending
developments in the case brought by the Department of Justice (see above
description). In the light of the decision by the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals in the Department of Justice case (see immediately preceding
paragraph), the plaintiffs in these class actions have dismissed their claims.

On May 17, 2002, the named plaintiffs in

Hall, et al. v. United Airlines, et
al.

, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
North Carolina, filed an amended complaint alleging that between 1995 and the
present, American and over 15 other defendant airlines conspired to reduce
commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in violation of Section 1 of the
Sherman Act. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.
The court granted class action certification to the plaintiffs on September
17, 2002, defining the plaintiff class as all travel agents in the United
States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, who, at any time
from October 1, 1997 to the present, issued tickets, miscellaneous change
orders, or prepaid ticket advices for travel on any of the defendant airlines.
The case is stayed as to US Airways and United Air Lines, since they filed for
bankruptcy. American is vigorously defending the lawsuit. Defendant carriers
filed a motion for summary judgment on December 10, 2002, which the court
granted on October 30, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed that order to the 4th
Circuit Court of Appeals, and that appeal remains pending. A final adverse
court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on
the Company’s commission policies or practices would have an adverse impact on
the Company.



Between April 3, 2003 and June 5, 2003, three lawsuits were filed by travel
agents some of whom have opted out of the

Hall

class action (above) to pursue
their claims individually against American Airlines, Inc., other airline
defendants, and in one case against certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC.
(

Tam Travel et. al., v. Delta Air Lines et. al.

, in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California — San Francisco (51 individual
agencies),

Paula Fausky d/b/a Timeless Travel v. American Airlines, et. al,

in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio Eastern
Division (29 agencies) and

Swope Travel et al. v. Orbitz et. al.

in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Beaumont Division (6
agencies)). Collectively, these lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief
alleging that the certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC: (i) conspired to
prevent travel agents from acting as effective competitors in the distribution
of airline tickets to passengers in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act;
(ii) conspired to monopolize the distribution of common carrier air travel
between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman
Act; and that (iii) between 1995 and the present, the airline defendants
conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in violation
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. These cases have been consolidated in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio Eastern
Division. American is vigorously defending these lawsuits. A final adverse
court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on
the Company’s distribution practices would have an adverse impact on the
Company.

On April 26, 2002, six travel agencies filed

Albany Travel Co., et al. v.
Orbitz, LLC, et al.

, in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California against American, United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines, and
Orbitz, LLC, alleging that American and the other defendants: (i) conspired to
prevent travel agents from acting as effective competitors in the distribution
of airline tickets to passengers in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act;
and (ii) conspired to monopolize the distribution of common carrier air travel
between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman
Act. The named plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class of travel agents,
but no class has yet been certified. On November 25, 2002, the District Court
stayed this case pending a judgment in

Hall et. al. v. United Airlines, et. al.

(see above description). In light of the decision of the court in

Hall et. al

(discussed above), the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this action.

On April 25, 2002, a Quebec travel agency filed a motion seeking a declaratory
judgment of the Superior Court in Montreal, Canada (

Voyages Montambault (1989)
Inc. v. International Air Transport Association, et al.

), that American and the
other airline defendants owe a “fair and reasonable commission” to the agency,
and that American and the other airline defendants breached alleged contracts
with the agency by adopting policies of not paying base commissions. The
motion was subsequently amended to add 40 additional travel agencies as
petitioners. The current defendants are the International Air Transport
Association, the Air Transport Association of Canada, Air Canada, American,
America West Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Grupo TACA, Northwest Airlines/KLM
Airlines, and Continental Airlines. American is vigorously defending the
lawsuit. Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit, a
final adverse court decision granting declaratory relief could expose the
Company to claims for substantial money damages or force the Company to pay
agency commissions, either of which would have an adverse impact on the
Company.

On May 13, 2002, the named plaintiffs in

Always Travel, et. al. v. Air Canada,
et. al.

, pending in the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, Montreal,
filed a statement of claim alleging that between 1995 and the present,
American, the other defendant airlines, and the International Air Transport
Association conspired to reduce commissions paid to Canada-based travel agents
in violation of Section 45 of the Competition Act of Canada. The named
plaintiffs seek monetary damages and injunctive relief and seek to certify a
nationwide class of travel agents. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class
certification, but that motion has not yet been decided. American is
vigorously defending the lawsuit. A final adverse court decision awarding
substantial money damages or placing restrictions on the Company’s commission
policies would have an adverse impact on the Company.



On August 14, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against American Airlines,
Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, Western Division (

All World Professional Travel Services, Inc. v.
American Airlines, Inc.

). The lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies
to pay debit memos for refunding tickets after September 11, 2001: (1)
breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American and plaintiff; (2)
constitutes unjust enrichment; and (3) violates the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). The as yet uncertified class
includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay moneys to
American for an “administrative service charge,” “penalty fee,” or other fee
for processing refunds on behalf of passengers who were unable to use their
tickets in the days immediately following the resumption of air carrier service
after the tragedies on September 11, 2001. The plaintiff seeks to enjoin
American from collecting the debit memos and to recover the amounts paid for
the debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The Company
intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that
the litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision could impose
restrictions on the Company’s relationships with travel agencies which could
have an adverse impact on the Company.

On August 19, 2002, a class action lawsuit seeking monetary damages was filed,
and on May 7, 2003 an amended complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (

Power Travel International, Inc.
v. American Airlines, Inc., et al.

) against American, Continental Airlines,
Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Northwest Airlines, alleging that
American and the other defendants breached their contracts with the agency and
were unjustly enriched when these carriers at various times reduced their base
commissions to zero. The as yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies
accredited by the Airlines Reporting Corporation “whose base commissions on
airline tickets were unilaterally reduced to zero by” the defendants. The case
is stayed as to United Air Lines, since it filed for bankruptcy. American is
vigorously defending the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that the
litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision awarding
substantial money damages or forcing the Company to pay agency commissions
would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Miami-Dade County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating
various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and
funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery
methods. American Airlines, Inc. and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially
responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination at MIA. During the second
quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including
American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and future cleanup
costs (

Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo Services, Inc., et al.

in
the Florida Circuit Court). In addition to the 17 defendants named in the
lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and
contributors to the contamination. American’s and AMR Eagle’s portion of the
cleanup costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including
the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the proportion
of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and
uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately
supervise the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. The
Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

Includes a one-time, non-cash charge, effective January 1, 2002, of $988
million, net of tax, to write-off all of AMR’s goodwill. This charge
resulted from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

On April 9, 2001, American (through its wholly owned subsidiary TWA
Airlines LLC) purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed
certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. Accordingly, the 2001
financial information above includes the operating results of TWA LLC
since the date of acquisition.


As of December 31, 2002, the Company recorded an additional minimum
pension liability adjustment resulting in an after tax charge to
stockholders’ equity of approximately $1.0 billion. The Company recorded a
reduction to the additional minimum pension liability resulting in a
credit to stockholders equity of approximately $337 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Effective after the close of business on March
15, 2000, AMR distributed 0.722652 shares of Sabre Holdings Corporation
(Sabre) Class A Common Stock for each share of AMR stock owned by AMR’s
shareholders, thus distributing its entire ownership interest in Sabre.
The dividend of AMR’s entire ownership in Sabre’s common stock resulted in
a reduction to AMR’s retained earnings equal to the carrying value of the
Company’s investment in Sabre on March 15, 2000, which approximated $581
million.

No cash dividends were declared on AMR’s common shares during any of the
periods above.

Information on the comparability of results is included in Item 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking Information

The discussions under Business, Properties and Legal Proceedings and the
following discussions under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations contain various forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which
represent the Company’s expectations or beliefs concerning future events. When
used in this document and in documents incorporated herein by reference, the
words “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” and similar expressions
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
include, without limitation, the Company’s expectations concerning operations
and financial conditions, including changes in capacity, revenues, and costs,
future financing needs, overall economic conditions, plans and objectives for
future operations, and the impact on the Company of its results of operations
for the past three years and the sufficiency of its financial resources to
absorb that impact. Other forward-looking statements include statements which
do not relate solely to historical facts, such as, without limitation,
statements which discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or
uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or
uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking
statements in this report are based upon information available to the Company
on the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events, or otherwise. The risk factors listed at the end of
this Item, in addition to other possible risk factors not listed, could cause
the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
forward-looking statements.

Overview

The events of the past several years have had a material adverse impact on the
Company’s finances. The Company incurred operating losses of $0.8 billion,
$3.3 billion and $2.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The Company incurred net losses of $1.2 billion, $3.5
billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

These losses reflect, among other things, a substantial decrease in the
Company’s revenues, which began in early 2001. The revenue decrease has been
driven by a number of factors, some of which the Company believes will persist
indefinitely or permanently. These factors include: (i) a steep fall-off in
the demand for air travel, particularly business travel, primarily caused by
weakness in the U.S. economy, (ii) reduced pricing power, resulting mainly from
greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers, especially business
travelers, increasing competition from low-cost carriers (LCCs) and the
continuing increase in pricing transparency resulting from the use of the
Internet and (iii) the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, which accelerated and exacerbated the trend of decreased demand and
reduced industry revenues.

In response to decreased demand following the events of September 11, 2001, the
Company reduced its operating schedule by approximately 20 percent and reduced
its workforce by approximately 20,000 jobs. Subsequent to these reductions, the
Company determined that achieving $4 billion in annual capacity-independent
cost savings was necessary to offset the revenue decline and initiated the
following restructuring activities to realize this goal:

•

In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its
annual costs by $2 billion. These initiatives are being implemented
through 2005, and involve: (i) scheduling efficiencies, including the
de-peaking of certain of its hubs, (ii) fleet simplification, (iii)
streamlined customer interaction, (iv) distribution modifications, (v)
in-flight product changes, (vi) operational changes and (vii)
headquarters/administration efficiencies. As a result of the initiatives,
the Company reduced an estimated 7,000 jobs by March 2003.



•

In February 2003, American asked its employees for approximately $1.8 billion
in annual savings through a combination of changes in wages, benefits and
work rules. In April 2003, American reached agreements with its three unions
(the Labor Agreements) and also implemented various changes in the pay plans
and benefits for non-unionized personnel, including officers and other
management (the Management Reductions). In addition, the Company and American
reached concessionary agreements with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and
suppliers (collectively, the Vendors, and the agreements, the Vendor
Agreements), resulting in approximately $200 million in annual cost savings.
Generally, under the terms of these Vendor Agreements, the Company or
American receives the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods
and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect to
certain of its aircraft.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the
special charges associated with the Company’s ongoing restructuring activities.

In the second quarter of 2003, in conjunction with some improvement in the U.S.
economy, the Company’s revenue environment began to improve, as reflected in
higher unit revenues (revenue per available seat mile) in May through December
2003, when compared to May through December 2002, respectively. Even with this
improvement, however, the Company’s revenues remain depressed relative to
historical levels. The Company therefore needs to see continued improvement in
the revenue environment, additional cost reductions and further productivity
improvements before it can return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels.

In 2003, the Company announced the Turnaround Plan, a four tenet plan designed
to achieve sustained profitability.

•

Lower Costs To Compete:

As discussed above, one of the Company’s
critical goals is to reduce costs by $4 billion annually, including $2
billion from strategic initiatives, $1.8 billion from labor cost
savings and $200 million from vendors, suppliers and creditors.
Progress toward this goal helped the Company achieve a significant
year-over-year decline in costs per available seat mile in the fourth
quarter of 2003 and in 2003 as a whole. If not for rising fuel prices,
the Company’s progress in reducing costs would have been even more
significant. The Company has returned underused gate space,
consolidated terminal space, de-peaked its Chicago and Dallas/Fort
Worth hub schedules (with its Miami hub to be de-peaked in 2004),
closed a reservations center, reduced the size of its St. Louis hub,
accelerated the retirement of certain aircraft, and improved aircraft
utilization across its fleet.

•

Fly Smart, Give Customers What They Value:

This tenet focuses on
customer service and revenue production, with emphasis on improving
the Company’s relative revenue performance compared to others in the
airline industry. Actions in this area include adding seats to
American’s Boeing 757 and Airbus A300 fleets and restructuring the
hubs at Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth and St. Louis. Another step is
expanding alliances. The Company’s progress includes a domestic
codeshare with Alaska Airlines, governmental approval of codesharing
with British Airways, the addition of SWISS International to the

one

world alliance, and the recently announced codeshare linkage with
Mexicana (which, subject to governmental approvals, will be launched
in April 2004).

•

Pull Together, Win Together:

Fostering greater cooperation than ever
with employees, the Company has launched an unprecedented level of
openness with employee groups and labor unions. The Company’s
President and Chief Executive Officer holds regular “Town Hall"-style
meetings with employees, and its Chief Financial Officer meets monthly
with union leaders to discuss the Company’s financial results with
them in much the same way as he briefs AMR’s Board of Directors. In
addition, the Company has engaged a firm that works to bring union
groups and management together, to help to promote a philosophy of
active involvement.



•

Build A Financial Foundation For Our Future:

The Company ended the
fourth quarter of 2003 with $2.6 billion in unrestricted cash and
short-term investments and $527 million in restricted cash and
short-term investments. The Company had $1.3 billion in unrestricted
cash and short-term investments and $550 million in restricted cash and
short-term investments at the close of the first quarter of 2003. From
April 1 to December 31, 2003, cash flows from operations totaled $1.1
billion. The Company has also been able to sell some non-core assets,
such as its stakes in Worldspan, a computer reservations company;
Hotwire, a discount travel website company; and a portion of its stake
in Orbitz, a travel planning website.

The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations,
including capital expenditures and commitments. However, to
maintain sufficient liquidity over the long-term as the Company continues to implement the
Turnaround Plan and seeks to return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels, the Company will need continued access to additional funding. In
addition, the Company’s ability to return to sustained profitability at
acceptable levels will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are
largely beyond the Company’s control. Some of the risk factors that have had
and/or may have a negative impact on the Company’s business and financial
results are discussed in Risk Factors at the end of this Item. In particular,
if the revenue environment deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the
Company is unable to access the capital markets, it may be unable to fund its
obligations and sustain its operations in the long-term.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, Short-Term Investments, Restricted Assets and Deposits

At December 31, 2003, the Company had $2.6 billion in unrestricted cash and
short-term investments and $527 million in restricted cash and short-term
investments. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $166
million in fuel prepayments and credit card holdback deposits classified as
Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Significant Indebtedness and Future Financing

During 2001, 2002 and 2003, the Company raised an aggregate of approximately
$10.0 billion of financing to fund capital commitments (mainly for aircraft and
ground properties) and operating losses. The Company expects that it will need
to continue to raise capital until it has achieved acceptable levels of
sustained profitability over a significant period of time. The Company’s
possible future financing sources include: (i) a limited amount of additional
secured aircraft debt (virtually all of the Company’s Section 1110-eligible
aircraft are encumbered), (ii) debt secured by other assets, (iii)
securitization of future operating receipts, (iv) sale-leaseback transactions
of owned aircraft, (v) the potential sale of certain non-core assets, (vi)
unsecured debt and (vii) equity and/or equity-like securities. However, the
availability and level of these financing sources cannot be assured,
particularly in light of the fact that the Company has fewer unencumbered
assets available than it has had in the past. To the extent that the Company’s
revenues deteriorate beyond normal seasonal trends or it is unable to access
capital markets and raise additional capital, the Company may be unable to fund
its obligations and sustain its operations in the long-term.

The Company’s significant indebtedness could have important consequences, such
as (i) limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general purposes, (ii)
requiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from
operations to payments on its indebtedness, (iii) making the Company more
vulnerable to economic downturns, (iv) limiting its ability to withstand
competitive pressures and reducing its flexibility in responding to changing
business and economic conditions, and (v) limiting the Company’s flexibility in
planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which
it operates.

Credit Ratings

AMR’s and American’s credit ratings are significantly below investment grade.
Additional reductions in AMR’s or American’s credit ratings could further
increase its borrowing or other costs and further restrict the availability of
future financing.



Credit Facility Covenants

American has a fully drawn $834 million bank credit facility that expires
December 15, 2005, which contains a liquidity covenant and an EBITDAR
(generally, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
rentals, adjusted for certain non-cash items) to fixed charges (generally,
interest and total rentals) ratio covenant. The required EBITDAR to fixed
charges ratio is 1.1 to 1.0 for the three-month period ending March 31, 2004,
and increases on a quarterly basis up to 1.5 to 1.0 for each four consecutive
quarters ending after December 31, 2004. The liquidity covenant requires
American to maintain a minimum level of $1.0 billion of unrestricted cash and
short-term investments. The Company expects to be able to continue to comply
with these covenants. However, it cannot be sure that it will continue to be
able to do so through the expiration of the facility. Failure to do so would
result in a default under this facility and a significant amount of American’s
other debt.

Financing Activity

The Company, or its subsidiaries, issued the following debt during the year
ended December 31, 2003 (in millions):

Enhanced equipment trust certificates (3.86% interest) (final
maturity 2010)

$


4.25% senior convertible notes due 2023


AA/Ft. Worth HQ securitization (7.2% effective interest) (final
maturity 2010)


Various debt agreements related to the purchase of jet aircraft
(effective interest rates ranging from 7.93% to 9.12%) (various
maturities through 2013)


Various debt agreements related to the purchase of regional jet
aircraft (effective interest rates ranging from 4.25% to 6.73%)
(various maturities through 2020)


$

1,680

See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding the debt issuances listed above.

In February 2004, American issued $180 million of Fixed Rate Secured Notes due
2009. These notes are secured by certain spare parts and bear interest at 7.25
percent. Also in February 2004, AMR issued, and American guaranteed, $324
million of 4.5 percent senior convertible notes due 2024.

Other Operating and Investing Activities

The improved revenue environment and the effects of the Company’s cost savings
initiatives resulted in improved cash flow from operating activities in 2003.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31,
2003 was $601 million, an increase of $1.7 billion over 2002. Included in net
cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was the receipt of a $572 million
federal tax refund and the receipt of $358 million from the U.S. government
under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (the Act),
offset by $521 million of redemption payments under operating leases for
special facility revenue bonds. Included in net cash provided (used) by
operating activities during 2002 was the receipt of an approximately $658
million federal tax refund as a result of the utilization of the Company’s 2001
net operating losses (NOLs). The Company does not expect to receive significant
additional federal tax refunds.

Capital expenditures during 2003 were $1.4 billion, $735 million of which were
seller financed, and included the acquisition of nine Boeing 767-300ERs, two
Boeing 777-200 ERs, 16 Embraer 140s, six Embraer 145s and 11 Bombardier CRJ-700
aircraft.



During 2003, the Company sold its interests in Worldspan, a computer
reservations company, and Hotwire, a discount travel website. The Company
received $180 million in cash and a $39 million promissory note for its
interest in Worldspan. It received $84 million in cash, $80 million of which
was recognized as a gain, for its interest in Hotwire. In addition, during
2003, the Company sold a portion of its interest in Orbitz, a travel planning
website, in connection with an Orbitz initial public offering and a secondary
offering resulting in total proceeds of $65 million, and a gain of $70 million.

On April 9, 2001, TWA Airlines, LLC (TWA LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of
American, purchased substantially all of the assets of Trans World Airlines,
Inc. (TWA) for approximately $742 million (which was funded from the Company’s
existing cash and short-term investments) and the assumption of certain
liabilities.

Working Capital

AMR (principally American) historically operates with a working capital
deficit, as do most other airline companies. In addition, the Company has
historically relied heavily on external financing to fund capital expenditures.
More recently, the Company has also relied on external financing to fund
operating losses.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has completed its evaluation of its interests in variable interest
entities and determined that it holds a significant variable interest in, but
is not the primary beneficiary of, certain trusts that are the lessors under 88
of its aircraft operating leases. These leases contain a fixed price purchase
option, which allows American to purchase the aircraft at a predetermined price
on a specified date. However, American does not guarantee the residual value of
the aircraft. As of December 31, 2003, future lease payments required under
these leases totaled $3.2 billion.

Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities
primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased
by American and accounted for as operating leases. Approximately $1.8 billion
of these bonds (with total future payments of approximately $4.8 billion as of
December 31, 2003) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both. Approximately $532
million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender
provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to
repurchase the bonds at various times: $112 million in 2004, $104 million in
2005, $28 million in 2006, $100 million in 2007 and $188 million in 2008.
Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no
assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to
redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce
existing rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid facility rentals and
would reduce future operating lease commitments.

In addition, the Company has other operating leases, primarily for aircraft,
with total future lease payments of $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2003.
Entering into aircraft leases allows the Company to obtain aircraft without
immediate cash outflows.

In addition to the commitments summarized above, the Company is required to
make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. These contributions
are required under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement
Pension Plan Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company’s estimated 2004 minimum
required contributions to its defined benefit pension plans are approximately
$600 million. (This estimate assumes Congress passes legislation providing
certain technical corrections to current ERISA funding requirements.) Due to
uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future
required contributions to its defined benefit pension plans, such as interest
rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns and the impact of proposed
legislation, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate its future required
contributions beyond 2004. However, based on the current regulatory
environment and market conditions, the Company expects that its 2005 minimum
required contributions will significantly exceed its 2004 minimum required
contributions. Congress is also considering other legislation that, if passed,
would further modestly reduce the Company’s 2004 minimum required contributions
and significantly reduce its 2005 minimum required contributions.

Agreements with Lessors and Lenders

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
reached concessionary agreements with certain lessors in 2003. Certain of the
Vendor Agreements provide that the Company’s obligations under the related
lease revert to the original terms if certain events (Events) occur prior to
December 31, 2005, including: (i) an event of default under the related lease
(which generally occurs only if a payment default occurs), (ii) an event of
loss with respect to the related aircraft, (iii) rejection by the Company of
the lease under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
(iv) the Company’s filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. If any one of these Events were to occur, the Company would be
responsible for approximately $24 million in additional operating lease
payments and $11 million in additional payments related to capital leases as of
December 31, 2003. This amount will increase to approximately $119 million in
operating lease payments and $111 million in payments related to capital leases
prior to the expiration of the provision on December 31, 2005. These amounts
are being accounted for as contingent rentals and will only be recognized if
they become due.

In addition, as part of the Vendor Agreements, American sold 33 Fokker 100
aircraft (with a minimal net book value), issued a $23 million
non-interest-bearing note, payable in installments and maturing in December
2010, entered into short-term leases on these aircraft and issued shares of AMR
common stock as discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
In exchange, approximately $130 million of debt related to certain of the
Fokker 100 aircraft was retired. However, the agreement contains provisions
that would require American to repay additional amounts of the original debt if
certain Events occur prior to December 31, 2005. As a result of this
transaction, including the sale of the 33 Fokker 100 aircraft, and the
termination of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements related to the debt
that has been retired, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $68
million. If none of the Events occur, the Company expects to recognize an
additional gain of approximately $37 million in December 2005.

Results of Operations

The Company’s 2003 results reflect a weak revenue environment, particularly in
the first four months of the year. They also reflect the benefit of the
Company’s cost reduction initiatives, especially the reduction in employee
costs due to the Labor Agreements and Management Reductions that came into
effect in the second quarter of 2003. The Company’s unit costs are now among
the lowest of the major network air carriers, and the Company believes it is
now better positioned to compete against low-cost carriers (LCCs). However, as
discussed in the Overview to this Item, the Company needs to see continued improvement in the
revenue environment, additional cost reductions and further productivity
improvements before it can return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels.



AMR’s net loss in 2003 was $1.2 billion, or $7.76 per share, an improvement of
$2.3 billion over AMR’s net loss in 2002 of $3.5 billion, or $22.57 per share.
The Company’s 2003 results include several special items which are discussed in
detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including (i)
$358 million in security cost reimbursements received under the Act (see Note 2
to the consolidated financial statements), (ii) $407 million in special charges
(see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), (iii) $150 million in
gains on the sale of the Company’s investments in Hotwire and Orbitz (see Note
3 to the consolidated financial statements) and (iv) a $164 million reduction
in previously accrued federal income taxes and related interest. In addition,
the Company did not record a tax benefit associated with its 2003 losses. The
Company’s 2002 results include a one-time, non-cash charge to record the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting, effective January 1, 2002, of $988
million, or $6.35 per share, to write-off all of AMR’s goodwill upon the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 142 “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements), and special charges of $718 million (see Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements).

REVENUES

2003 Compared to 2002

The Company’s revenues were relatively flat
year-over-year, increasing approximately $20 million, or 0.1 percent, to $17.4
billion. During the first four months of the year, yields (passenger revenue
per available seat mile) and load factors were down year-over-year, due to the
impact of the war in Iraq and SARS. In the latter part of the year, both
yields and load factors improved year-over-year, as the impact of the war in
Iraq and SARS faded, and the U.S. economy began recovering. However, even with
the recent improvements, the Company’s unit revenues and yield are still
depressed relative to historical measures.

For the full year, American’s passenger revenues decreased by 0.7 percent, or
$108 million, to $14.3 billion, on a capacity decrease of 4.1 percent to 165
billion available seat miles (ASMs). American’s passenger load factor
increased 2.1 points to 72.8 percent and passenger revenue yield per passenger
mile increased by 0.4 percent, or 0.05 cents, to 11.91 cents, driving
American’s passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) up by 3.3 percent,
or 0.28 cents, to 8.67 cents. In 2003, American derived approximately 70
percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 30
percent from international operations. Following is additional information
regarding Americans domestic and international RASM and capacity:

The Company’s Regional Affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries,
American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, AMR
Eagle), and two independent carriers with which American has capacity purchase
agreements, Trans States Airlines, Inc. (Trans States) and Chautauqua Airlines,
Inc. (Chautauqua). In 2003, American had capacity purchase agreements with
Chautauqua and Trans States for the full year. In 2002, American had a
capacity purchase agreement with Chautauqua for the full year and a capacity
purchase agreement with Trans States beginning in November 2002.

Regional Affiliates’ passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard
mileage proration agreements for flights connecting to American flights,
increased $88 million, or 6.1 percent, to $1.5 billion as a result of increased
capacity and load factors. Regional Affiliates’ traffic increased 20.5
percent, or 940 million revenue passenger miles (RPMs), to 5.5 billion RPMs,
while capacity increased 18.6 percent, or 1.3 billion ASMs, to 8.6 billion
ASMs. This is somewhat offset by the elimination, in 2003, of a fee, paid to
AMR Eagle by American, for passengers connecting to American flights.

Cargo revenues remained relatively flat with a decrease of 0.5 percent, or $3
million, to $558 million.



Other revenues increased 4.4 percent, or $43 million, to $1.0 billion due to
increases in (i) airfreight service fees due primarily to fuel surcharges, (ii)
AAdvantage program fees, (iii) employee travel service charges, (iv) excess
baggage fees and (v) ticket change fees coupled with changes to the Company’s
change fee arrangements with travel agencies. These increases were offset
somewhat by decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for
other airlines.

2002 Compared to 2001

Although traffic continued to increase on reduced
capacity following the events of September 11, 2001, the Company’s 2002
revenues and yields were down materially year-over-year. In addition to the
residual effects of September 11, the Company’s revenues continued to be
negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel
declines and changes in business traveler profiles; the geographic distribution
of the Company’s network; and reduced fares due in part to increased
competition from low-cost carriers. TWA LLC purchased substantially all of the
assets and assumed certain liabilities of TWA on April 9, 2001. The results of
operations of TWA LLC are included in the Company and American’s results of
operations beginning on that date. The Company’s revenues decreased
approximately $1.5 billion, or 8.2 percent, to $17.4 billion.

American’s passenger revenues decreased by 8.5 percent, or $1.3 billion, to
$14.4 billion. American’s passenger load factor increased by 1.7 points to
70.7 percent while passenger revenue yield per passenger mile decreased by 9.3
percent, or 1.22 cents, to 11.86 cents, driving American’s RASM down by 7.2
percent, or 0.65 cents, to 8.39 cents. In 2002, American derived approximately
70 percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately
30 percent from international operations. Following is additional information
regarding Americans domestic and international RASM and capacity:

Regional Affiliates’ passenger revenues increased $3 million, or 0.2 percent,
to $1.4 billion. AMR Eagle’s traffic increased 11 percent, or 409 million
RPMs, to 4.1 billion RPMs, while capacity increased 1.9 percent, or 121 million
ASMs, to 6.6 billion ASMs.

Cargo revenues decreased 15.3 percent, or $101 million, to $561 million
primarily due to the economic slowdown and significant restrictions on cargo
shipments for security reasons.

Other revenues decreased 10.1 percent, or $111 million, to $988 million due
primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for
other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service
charges.



OPERATING EXPENSES

2003 Compared to 2002

The Company’s operating expenses decreased 11.9
percent, or $2.5 billion, to $18.3 billion and American’s mainline operating
expenses per ASM decreased 8.9 percent to 10.15 cents, including the impact of
special charges and the U.S. government grant. The decrease in operating
expenses and operating expenses per ASM is largely due to the Company’s cost
savings initiatives coupled with security cost reimbursements from the U.S.
government and a decrease in special charges.

ASM decreased 1.5 percent to 11.14 cents, including the impact of special
charges and the U.S. government grant. The decrease in operating expenses and
operating expenses per ASM is largely due to cost savings initiatives
implemented in late 2001 and 2002.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

Other income (expense) consists of interest income and expense, interest
capitalized and miscellaneous — net.

2003 Compared to 2002

Other expense decreased $66 million, or 12.5 percent,
to $464 million due primarily to the following: Interest income decreased $16
million, or 22.5 percent, to $55 million due primarily to decreases in interest
rates. Interest expense increased $18 million, or 2.6 percent, to $703 million
resulting primarily from the approximately $903 million increase in the
Company’s long-term debt, offset by an $84 million reduction in interest
expense related to the agreement reached with the IRS discussed below.
Interest capitalized decreased $15 million, or 17.4 percent, to $71 million due
primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment.
Miscellaneous-net increased $115 million to $113 million, due primarily to an
$80 million gain on the sale of the Company’s investment in Hotwire and a $70
million gain related to an initial public offering by Orbitz, offset by the
write-down of certain investments held by the Company during the first quarter
of 2003.

2002 Compared to 2001

Other expense increased $244 million, or 85.3 percent,
to $530 million due primarily to the following: Interest income decreased $39
million, or 35.5 percent, to $71 million due primarily to decreases in interest
rates. Interest expense increased $147 million, or 27.3 percent, to $685
million resulting primarily from the increase in the Company’s long-term debt
of approximately $2.7 billion. Interest capitalized decreased $58 million, or
40.3 percent, to $86 million due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits
for flight equipment.

INCOME TAX BENEFIT


The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with its 2003
losses due to the Company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in Note
8 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, in 2003, the Company
reached an agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995. As a
result of this agreement, the Company recorded an $80 million tax benefit to
reduce previously accrued income tax liabilities and an $84 million reduction
in interest expense to reduce previously accrued interest related to the
accrued income tax liabilities.


The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 was impacted
by a $57 million charge resulting from a provision in Congress’ economic
stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of NOLs. This change
allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather than
two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover
its NOLs. The extended NOL carryback did however result in the displacement of
foreign tax credits taken in prior years. These credits are now expected to
expire before being utilized by the Company, resulting in this charge.

Note:

Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation.



Government Assistance

In April 2003, the President signed the Act, which includes aviation-related
assistance provisions. The Act authorized payment of (i) $100 million to
compensate air carriers for the direct costs associated with the strengthening
of flight deck doors and locks and (ii) $2.3 billion to reimburse air carriers
for increased security costs, which was distributed in proportion to the
amounts each carrier had paid or collected in passenger security and air
carrier security fees to the Transportation Security Administration (the
Security Fee Reimbursement). The Company’s Security Fee Reimbursement was $358
million (net of payments to independent regional affiliates) and was recorded
as a reduction to operating expenses. In addition, the Act suspended the
collection of the passenger security fee from June 1, 2003 until September 30,
2003 and authorized the extension of war-risk insurance through August 31, 2004
(and permits further extensions until December 31, 2004).

Outlook

Capacity for American’s mainline jet operations is expected to increase about
six percent in 2004, despite removing aircraft from the fleet and reducing
mainline departures. This is due to increased efficiencies, driven by three
factors: (i) American operated with a low base number of flights in 2003 as a
result of the war in Iraq and SARS, (ii) American is adding seats back to its
Boeing 757 and Airbus A300 aircraft and (iii) as American realigns its
mid-continent hubs and de-peaks its Miami schedule, its aircraft productivity
levels will improve.

American’s goal is to improve its unit costs by 17 percent in the first quarter
of 2004 compared to the first quarter of 2003, and by ten percent for the full
year, compared to 2003. American will have a full year of labor savings from
its Labor Agreements and Management Reductions and more fully realize the
savings from its other strategic cost savings initiatives. However, there are
significant cost challenges in 2004 that may affect its ability to achieve this
goal, primarily from medical benefits costs, airport fees and maintenance,
materials and repairs costs (due to flight hour agreement contractual rate
increases and the benefit from retiring aircraft subsiding). In addition, the
Company expects fuel prices to remain high during 2004. See “Risk Factors”.

Other Information

Environmental Matters

Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potential
liability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and certain
airport locations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential
liability is joint and several. AMR’s alleged volumetric contributions at all
but one of these sites are minimal compared to others. AMR does not expect
these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material impact on its
results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additional information
is included in Part C of Item 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. The Company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable;
however, actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could
differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following critical
accounting policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of the
Company’s financial statements: accounting for long-lived assets, passenger
revenue, frequent flyer program, pensions and other postretirement benefits,
and income taxes.



Long-lived
assets

— The Company has approximately $20 billion of long-lived
assets as of December 31, 2003, including approximately $19 billion related
to flight equipment and other fixed assets. In addition to the original
cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of
policy elections made by the Company, including estimated useful lives and
salvage values. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on long-lived
assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets
and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In
making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions,
including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets, and
(ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets,
which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length
of service and estimated salvage values. A change in the Company’s fleet
plan has been the primary indicator that has resulted in an impairment
charge. The Company recorded impairment charges related to its Fokker 100,
Saab 340 and ATR 42 aircraft in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, the Company
recorded an impairment charge related to its Airbus A300 aircraft as a
result of accelerating the planned retirement of this fleet. In addition,
in 2003, the Company recorded impairment charges related to its Boeing
767-200 aircraft and four of its Boeing 767-200ER aircraft as a result of
permanently retiring these aircraft. Also in 2003, the Company analyzed its
remaining Boeing 767-200ER aircraft and determined that these aircraft were
not impaired based on anticipated future cash flows. See Notes 1 and 2 to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information with
respect to these impairment charges and each of the policies and
assumptions used by the Company which affect the recorded values of
long-lived assets.

Passenger revenue —

Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a
component of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is
recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various
factors, including the industry’s pricing structure and interline
agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in
revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue
recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized, including breakage.
These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical
trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model
the outcome of future events based on the Company’s historical experience
and are generally recognized at the time of sale. The Company’s estimation
techniques have been applied consistently from year to year. However, due
to changes in the Company’s ticket refund policy and changes in the travel
profile of customers, historical trends may not be representative of future
results.

Frequent
flyer program

— The Company uses a number of estimates in
accounting for its AAdvantage frequent flyer program. Additional
information regarding the Company’s AAdvantage frequent flyer program is
included in Part F of Item 1 of this Report. Changes to the percentage of
the amount of revenue deferred, deferred recognition period, percentage of
awards expected to be redeemed for travel on participating airlines, cost
per mile estimates or the minimum award level accrued could have a
significant impact on the Company’s revenues or incremental cost accrual in
the year of the change as well as in future years.

Pensions and other postretirement benefits

— The Company’s pension and
other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using
various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. The Company uses certain
assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i)
discount rate, (ii) expected return on plan assets, and (iii) expected
health care cost trend rate.



These assumptions as of December 31 were:

The Company’s discount rate is determined based upon the review of high
quality corporate bond rates, the change in these rates during the year,
and year-end rate levels. Lowering the discount rate by 0.5 percent as of
December 31, 2003 would increase the Company’s pension and postretirement
benefits liability by approximately $532 million and $169 million,
respectively, and increase estimated 2004 pension and postretirement
benefits expense by $66 million and $10 million, respectively.

The expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of the
Company’s historical trends and experience taking into account current and
expected market conditions. The expected return on plan assets component of
the Company’s net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair
value of plan assets and the Company’s target asset allocation of 40
percent longer duration corporate bonds, 25 percent U.S. value stocks, 20
percent international stocks, five percent emerging markets stocks and
bonds and 10 percent alternative (private) investments. The Company
monitors its actual asset allocation and believes that its long-term asset
allocation will continue to approximate its target allocation. The
Company’s historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets,
calculated using a geometric compounding of monthly returns, is
approximately 10.5 percent as of December 31, 2003. Lowering the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.5 percent as of December 31,
2003 would increase estimated 2004 pension expense by approximately $32
million.

The health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of the
Company’s historical trends and experience taking into account current and
expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend
rate by 1.0 percent would increase estimated 2004 postretirement benefits
expense by $41 million.

The Company has pension and postretirement benefit unrecognized net
actuarial losses as of December 31, 2003, of approximately $1.6 billion and
$407 million, respectively. The unrecognized net actuarial losses
represent changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation, the
postretirement accumulated benefit obligation and plan assets resulting
from (i) changes in assumptions and (ii) actual experience differing from
assumptions. The amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss component
of the Company’s 2004 pension and postretirement benefit net periodic
benefit costs are expected to be approximately $58 million and $8 million,
respectively. The Company’s total 2004 defined benefit pension expense and
postretirement expense is currently estimated to be approximately $428
million and $264 million (including the impact of the Medicare legislation
discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements),
respectively.

The Company records an additional minimum pension liability when its
accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the pension plans’ assets in excess
of amounts previously accrued for pension costs. As of December 31, 2003,
the Company’s additional minimum pension liability was $1.1 billion, down
from $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2002, primarily as a result of
significantly improved asset performance. The decrease in the Company’s
minimum pension liability resulted in a 2003 credit to equity of
approximately $337 million. An additional minimum pension liability is
recorded as an increase to the pension liability, an increase to other
assets (to the extent that a plan has unrecognized prior service costs) and
a charge to stockholders’ equity as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information regarding the Company’s pension and other
postretirement benefits.



Income taxes

— The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.
Accordingly, the Company records a deferred tax asset valuation allowance
when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers its historical
earnings, trends, and outlook for future years in making this
determination. The Company has a deferred tax valuation allowance of $663
million as of December 31, 2003. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

Tax contingencies

— The Company has reserves for taxes and associated
interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by
tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on
previously filed tax returns are appropriate, it nevertheless has
established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing
authorities may challenge the positions taken by the Company resulting in
additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The tax reserves are
reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect
the Company’s potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of
applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional
exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues,
release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision
affecting a particular tax issue. In 2003, the Company reached an
agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995 and as a
result, recorded an $80 million tax benefit to reduce previously accrued
income tax liabilities and an $84 million reduction in interest expense to
reduce previously accrued interest related to accrued tax liabilities.

Risk Factors

The Company’s ability to return to sustained profitability will depend on a
number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond the Company’s control.
Among other things, the following factors have had and/or may have a negative
impact on the Company’s business and financial results:

Economic and Other Conditions

The airline industry is affected by changes in
international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial
conditions, inflation, war, terrorist attacks, political instability (or the
threat thereof), consumer preferences and spending patterns, demographic
trends, disruptions to the air traffic control system, consumer perceptions of
airline safety, costs of safety, security and environmental measures, and the
weather.

Substantial Indebtedness

The Company has, and will continue to have, a
significant amount of indebtedness. In addition, the Company, American and
their respective subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including
secured debt, in the future. As discussed earlier in this Report, the
Company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For
example, it could (i) limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional
financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general
corporate purposes, (ii) require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion
of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, thereby
reducing the funds available for other purposes, (iii) make the Company more
vulnerable to economic downturns, (iv) limit its ability to withstand
competitive pressures and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing
business and economic conditions and, (v) limit the Company’s flexibility in
planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which
it operates.

Credit Facility Covenants

American has a fully drawn $834 million bank credit
facility that expires December 15, 2005, which contains a liquidity covenant
and an EBITDAR (generally, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and rentals, adjusted for certain non-cash items) to fixed charges
(generally, interest and total rentals) ratio covenant. The Company expects to
be able to continue to comply with these covenants. However, it cannot be sure
that it will continue to be able to do so through the expiration of the
facility. Failure to do so would result in a default under this facility and a
significant amount of American’s other debt.

Fuel Prices / Supply

Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry,
in the event of continuing increases in the price of jet fuel, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to pass on increased fuel prices to its
customers by increasing its fares. Likewise, increased fare competition and
lower revenues for all air carriers may offset any potential benefit of lower
fuel prices. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had hedged approximately 21
percent of its expected first quarter 2004 fuel requirements, and a much lower
percentage of its expected fuel requirements beyond March 31, 2004.



While the Company does not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel
availability, dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of
changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and
marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel.
In the event there is an outbreak of hostilities or other conflicts in oil
producing areas or elsewhere, there could be reductions in the production
and/or importation of crude oil and/or significant increases in the cost of
fuel. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or
significant increases in its cost, or if current high prices are sustained for
a significant period of time, the Company’s business, as well as that of the
entire industry, would be adversely affected.

Competition in the Airline Industry

Service over almost all of the Company’s
routes is highly competitive and fares remain at historically low levels. The
Company faces vigorous competition from major domestic airlines, national,
regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers, low-cost air
carriers, and, particularly on shorter segments, ground transportation.
Increasingly, the Company faces significant competition from
marketing/operational alliances formed by its competitors. To the extent those
alliances can undertake activities that are not available to the Company, the
Company’s ability to effectively compete could be hindered. Pricing decisions
are affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discounting by
competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company’s financial
results because the Company is generally required to match competitors’ fares
to maintain passenger traffic. No assurance can be given that any future fare
reduction would be offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction in
costs or changes in the mix of traffic that would improve yields. In addition,
since September 11, 2001, several air carriers have recently reorganized or are
reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including
United and US Airways. It is possible that other competitors may seek to
reorganize in or out of Chapter 11. Historically, air carriers involved in
reorganizations have undertaken substantial fare discounting in order to
maintain cash flows and enhance customer loyalty.

Restructuring Program

As discussed in the Overview to this Item, the Company
is continuing to implement a restructuring program. The ability of the Company
to successfully implement the program without affecting operational performance
and service levels is not assured.

Changing Business Strategy

The Company evaluates its assets on an ongoing
basis with a view to maximizing their value to the Company and determining
which are core to its operations. It also evaluates its business strategies.
The Company may change its business strategy in the future and may not pursue
some of the goals stated herein.

Reduced Pricing Power

The Company has reduced pricing power, resulting mainly
from greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers, especially business
travelers, and increasing competition from low cost carriers. The percentage
of routes on which the Company competes with carriers having substantially
lower operating costs has grown significantly over the past decade. The
Company now competes with low cost carriers on most of its domestic network.
At the same time, the continuous increase in pricing transparency resulting
from the use of the Internet has enabled cost conscious customers to more
easily obtain the lowest fare on any given route.

Government Regulation

Future results of the Company’s operations may vary
based upon any actions which the governmental agencies with jurisdiction over
the Company’s operations may take, including the granting and timing of certain
governmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed for
codesharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines, restrictions
on competitive practices (e.g., court orders, or agency regulations or
orders, that would curtail an airline’s ability to respond to a competitor),
the adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (e.g., new
passenger security standards), and the adoption of more restrictive
locally-imposed noise restrictions.



Military Involvement

Prior to the war in Iraq, the increased threat of U.S.
military involvement in overseas operations had a significant adverse impact on
the Company’s business, financial position (including access to capital
markets) and results of operations and on the airline industry in general.
Furthermore, the war in Iraq had a significant adverse impact on international
and domestic revenues and future bookings. The continuing U.S. military
involvement in Iraq, or other conflicts in the Middle East or elsewhere, may
result in a similar adverse impact.

Terrorist Attacks

As described elsewhere in this Report, the events of
September 11, 2001 had a material adverse impact on the Company. The
occurrence of another terrorist attack (whether domestic or international and
whether against the Company or another entity) would again have a material
adverse impact on the Company, its finances and/or its operations.

Uncertainty in International Operations

The Company’s current international
activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such as
reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls,
currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international government
regulation of the Company’s operations, including the inability to obtain or
retain needed route authorities and/or slots.

Diseases

In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS), which primarily had an adverse impact on the Company’s Pacific
operations. If there were another outbreak of a disease (such as SARS) that
affects travel behavior, it could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s operations.

Uncertainty of Future Collective Bargaining Agreements and Events

The Company’s
operations could be adversely affected by failure of the Company to reach
agreement with any labor union representing the Company’s employees. In
addition, a dispute between the Company and an employee work group (outside the
confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could adversely impact the
Company’s operations.

Need for Additional Liquidity

The Company needs additional liquidity because
of its significant debt obligations maturing in the next several years, as well
as substantial, and increasing pension funding obligations. The Company’s
ability to obtain future financing or to sell assets may also be adversely
affected because American has fewer unencumbered assets available than in years
past. In recent years, a large portion of the aircraft assets (including
virtually all of the aircraft eligible for benefits of Section 1110 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code) have been encumbered. The ability to borrow against or sell
those assets on acceptable terms is uncertain and, in any event, those assets
may not maintain their current market value. To maintain sufficient liquidity
as the Company continues to implement the Turnaround Plan, the Company will
need continued access to additional funding. If the revenue environment
deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the Company is unable to access
the capital markets, it may be unable to fund its obligations and sustain its
operations in the long-term.

Credit Ratings

Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, AMR’s and
American’s credit ratings have been lowered significantly. These reductions
have increased borrowing costs and limited borrowing options. Additional
significant reductions in the credit ratings could further increase borrowing
or other costs and further restrict the availability of future financing.

Insurance Costs

The Company carries insurance for public liability, passenger
liability, property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft. As
a result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of
insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to
persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of
terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these
insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in
general. The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk
insurance for U.S. based airlines until August 31, 2004, covering losses to
employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. In addition, the Secretary
of Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2004, at his
discretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the
U.S. government does not extend the policy beyond August 31, 2004, the Company
will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope from commercial
insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is not available at
commercially reasonable rates, the Company’s results of operations would be
negatively affected. In addition, in the event commercial insurance carriers
further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to the Company, or
significantly increase its cost, the Company’s operations and/or financial
position and results of operations would be adversely affected.



ITEM 7(A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions

The risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive instruments and
positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of
fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below.
The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such
adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider
additional actions management may take to mitigate the Company’s exposure to
such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. The Company does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 7 to
the consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional
information.

Aircraft Fuel

The Company’s earnings are affected by changes in the price and
availability of aircraft fuel. In order to provide a measure of control over
price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage
facilities to support its flight operations. The Company also manages the
price risk of fuel costs primarily by using jet fuel, heating oil, and crude
oil swap and option contracts. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10
percent increase in the December 31, 2003 and 2002 cost per gallon of fuel.
Based on projected 2004 fuel usage, such an increase would result in an
increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $268 million in 2004,
inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31,
2003, and assumes the Company’s fuel hedging program remains effective under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”. Comparatively, based on projected 2003
fuel usage, such an increase would have resulted in an increase to aircraft
fuel expense of approximately $205 million in 2003, inclusive of the impact of
fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2002. The change in market
risk is due to the increase in fuel prices and a decrease in the amount of fuel
hedged. Beginning in March 2003, because of the Company’s then existing
financial condition, the Company stopped entering into new hedge contracts and,
in June 2003, terminated substantially all of its contracts with maturities
beyond March 2004. Commencing in October 2003, the Company began to enter into
new fuel hedging contracts with maturities beyond March 2004 for a portion of
its future fuel requirements. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
hedged, with option contracts, approximately 12 percent of its estimated 2004
fuel requirements, or approximately 21 percent of its estimated first quarter
2004 fuel requirements, 16 percent of its second quarter 2004 estimated fuel
requirements and six percent of its estimated fuel requirements for the
remainder of 2004. Comparatively, as of December 31, 2002 the Company had
hedged approximately 32 percent of its estimated 2003 fuel requirements, 15
percent of its estimated 2004 fuel requirements, and approximately four percent
of its estimated 2005 fuel requirements. The Company’s credit rating has
limited its ability to enter into certain types of fuel hedge contracts. A
further deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position may negatively
affect the Company’s ability to hedge fuel in the future.

Foreign Currency

The Company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange
rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated
operating revenues and expenses. The Company’s largest exposure comes from the
British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American
currencies. Previously, the Company used options to hedge a portion of its
anticipated foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. After determining its
foreign currency hedge program’s impact was no longer materially beneficial,
the Company discontinued entering into foreign currency hedges. The Company
plans to periodically evaluate its foreign currency exposure to determine
whether its foreign currency
hedge program should be reinstated. The result of a uniform 10 percent
strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2003 and 2002
levels relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign
currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of
approximately $77 million and $65 million for the years ending December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, due to the Company’s foreign-denominated revenues
exceeding its foreign-denominated expenses. This sensitivity analysis was
prepared based upon projected 2004 and 2003 foreign currency-denominated
revenues and expenses as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



Interest

The Company’s earnings are also affected by changes in interest
rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and
short-term investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt
instruments. The Company’s largest exposure with respect to variable-rate debt
comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company
had variable-rate debt instruments representing approximately 37 percent and 43
percent of its total long-term debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, and interest rate swaps on notional amounts of approximately $138
million at December 31, 2002. If the Company’s interest rates average 10
percent more in 2004 than they did at December 31, 2003, the Company’s interest
expense would increase by approximately $13 million and interest income from
cash and short-term investments would increase by approximately $4 million. In
comparison, at December 31, 2002, the Company estimated that if interest rates
averaged 10 percent more in 2003 than they did at December 31, 2002, the
Company’s interest expense would have increased by approximately $15 million
and interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased
by approximately $5 million. These amounts are determined by considering the
impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the Company’s variable-rate
long-term debt, interest rate swap agreements, and cash and short-term
investment balances at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Market risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential
increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in
interest rates, and amounts to approximately $372 million and $395 million as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The change in market risk is due
primarily to the increase in the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt during
2003. The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt were estimated using
quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Company’s
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Other

The Company holds investments in certain other entities which are subject
to market risk. However, the impact of such market risk on earnings is not
significant due to the immateriality of the carrying value and the
geographically diverse nature of these holdings.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

AMR Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMR Corporation
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AMR Corporation
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for its goodwill
and other intangible assets as required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, including its principal subsidiary American Airlines, Inc.
(American). On April 9, 2001, American (through a wholly owned subsidiary, TWA
Airlines LLC (TWA LLC)) purchased substantially all of the assets of Trans
World Airlines, Inc. (TWA) and assumed certain liabilities. TWA was the eighth
largest U.S. carrier, with a primary domestic hub in St. Louis. American
funded the acquisition of TWA’s assets with its existing cash and short-term
investments. The acquisition of TWA was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of TWA LLC since
the date of acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2003
presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments

The Company has restricted cash
and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support
projected workers’ compensation obligations and various other obligations.

Inventories

Spare parts, materials and supplies relating to flight equipment
are carried at average acquisition cost and are expensed when used in
operations. Allowances for obsolescence are provided — over the estimated
useful life of the related aircraft and engines — for spare parts expected to
be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from service. Allowances are also
provided for spare parts currently identified as excess. These allowances are
based on management estimates, which are subject to change.

Maintenance and Repair Costs

Maintenance and repair costs for owned and
leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except
costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance
contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms.

Intangible Assets

Route acquisition costs and airport operating and gate
lease rights represent the purchase price attributable to route authorities
(including international airport take-off and landing slots), domestic airport
take-off and landing slots and airport gate leasehold rights acquired.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets (route acquisition costs) are tested for
impairment annually on December 31, rather than amortized, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142). Airport operating and gate lease rights are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years to a zero residual
value.

Statements of Cash Flows

Short-term investments, without regard to remaining
maturity at acquisition, are not considered as cash equivalents for purposes of
the statements of cash flows.

Employee Accruals

The Company estimates the amount of potential retroactive
pay expected to be provided upon finalization of a labor agreement for work
groups working under contracts that have become amendable. These estimates are
based upon management’s expectation of the most likely outcome of the contract
negotiations.



1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)

Equipment and Property

The provision for depreciation of operating equipment
and property is computed on the straight-line method applied to each unit of
property, except that major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are
depreciated on a group basis. The depreciable lives used for the principal
depreciable asset classifications are:

Depreciable Life

American jet aircraft and engines

20 – 30 years

ATR 42 aircraft



Saab 340 aircraft



Other regional aircraft and engines

16 – 20 years

Major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies

Life of equipment to
which applicable

Improvements to leased flight equipment

Term of lease

Buildings and improvements (principally on
leased land)

10-30 years or term of
lease

Furniture, fixtures and other equipment

3-10 years

Capitalized software

3-10 years


Approximate final aircraft retirement date.

Residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts, avionics and
assemblies are generally five to ten percent, except when guaranteed by a third
party for a different amount.

Equipment and property under capital leases are amortized over the term of the
leases or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their expected useful lives.
Lease terms vary but are generally ten to 25 years for aircraft and seven to 40
years for other leased equipment and property.

Measurement of Asset Impairments

In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on
long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate
that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and
the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In making
these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not
limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets, and (ii) estimated future
cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on
additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset
will be used in the Company’s operations and estimated salvage values.

Regional Affiliates

Revenue from ticket sales is generally recognized when
service is provided. Regional Affiliates revenues for flights connecting to
American flights are allocated based on industry standard mileage proration
agreements.

Passenger Revenue

Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a
component of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is
recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors,
including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the
industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding
both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to
be recognized, including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the
evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and
other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company’s
historical experience, and are generally recorded at the time of sale.



1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)

Frequent Flyer Program

The estimated incremental cost of providing free
travel awards is accrued when such award levels are reached. American sells
mileage credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent
flyer program. The portion of the revenue related to the sale of mileage
credits, representing the revenue for air transportation sold, is valued at
current market rates and is deferred and amortized over 28 months, which
approximates the expected period over which the mileage credits are used. The
remaining portion of the revenue, representing the marketing products sold and
administrative costs associated with operating the AAdvantage program, is
recognized upon sale, as the related services have been provided.

Tax Contingencies

The Company has reserves for taxes and associated interest
that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax
authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on
previously filed tax returns are appropriate, it nevertheless has established
tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may
challenge the positions taken by the Company resulting in additional
liabilities for taxes and interest. The tax reserves are reviewed as
circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the Company’s
potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable
statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on
current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative
guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
Advertising expense was $150 million, $161 million and $202 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Stock Options

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Under APB 25,
no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants if the exercise
price of the Company’s stock option grants is at or above the fair market value
of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company has adopted the pro
forma disclosure features of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123), as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure”. As required by SFAS 123,
pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share have been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and
awards granted using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123. The fair
value for the stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 2003, 2002 and 2001: risk-free interest rates ranging from
2.93% to 4.58%; dividend yields of 0%; expected stock volatility ranging from
45% to 55%; and expected life of the options ranging from 3.6 years to 4.5
years.

The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share
amounts if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation (in millions, except per share
amounts):

2. Special charges and U.S. government grant

In early 2001, the economic slowdown in the U.S. resulted in a sharp decline in
the Company’s revenues. This slowdown was accelerated and exacerbated by the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. As a result, the Company reduced its
operating schedule by approximately 20 percent and reduced its workforce by
approximately 20,000 jobs in the fourth quarter 2001. Subsequent to these
events, the Company determined that the revenue decrease would likely persist
indefinitely and that achieving $4 billion in annual capacity-independent cost
savings was necessary to offset the revenue decline. The Company initiated the
following restructuring activities to realize this goal:

•

In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its
costs by $2 billion. These initiatives are being implemented through
2005, and involve: (i) scheduling efficiencies, including the
de-peaking of certain of its hubs, (ii) fleet simplification, (iii)
streamlined customer interaction, (iv) distribution modifications, (v)
in-flight product changes, (vi) operational changes and (vii)
headquarters/administration efficiencies. As a result of the
initiatives, the Company reduced an estimated 7,000 jobs by March
2003.

•

In February 2003, American asked its employees for approximately $1.8
billion in annual savings through a combination of changes in wages,
benefits and work rules. In April 2003, American reached agreements
with its three unions (the Labor Agreements) and also implemented
various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-unionized
personnel, including officers and other management (the Management
Reductions), which resulted in additional workforce reductions. In
addition, the Company and American reached concessionary agreements
with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers (collectively,
the Vendors, and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements). Generally,
under the terms of these Vendor Agreements, the Company or American
will receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods
and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect
to certain of its aircraft.

As a result of the Company’s continuing restructuring activities, the Company
has recorded a number of special charges. Special charges (credits) for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included the following (in
millions):

In determining the asset impairment charges described above,
management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows using models
used by the Company in making fleet and scheduling decisions. In
determining the fair value of these aircraft, the Company considered
outside third party appraisals and recent transactions involving
sales of similar aircraft and engines. The Company also considered
internal valuation models in determining the fair value of these
aircraft, and with respect to the Fokker 100 aircraft, incorporated
the fact that with this grounding, no major airline will operate this
fleet type.

**

Work groups include pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, fleet
service clerks, agents, management and support staff personnel.



2. Special charges and U.S. government grant (Continued)

Other

As part of the Vendor Agreements discussed above, American sold 33 Fokker 100
aircraft (with a minimal net book value), issued a $23 million
non-interest-bearing note, payable in installments and maturing in December
2010, entered into short-term leases on these aircraft and issued shares of AMR
common stock as discussed in Note 9. In exchange, approximately $130 million of
debt related to certain of the Fokker 100 aircraft was retired. However, the
agreement contains provisions that would require American to repay additional
amounts of the original debt if certain events occur prior to December 31,
2005, including: (i) an event of default (which generally occurs only if a
payment default occurs), (ii) an event of loss with respect to the related
aircraft, (iii) rejection by the Company of the lease under the provisions of
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or (iv) the Company’s filing for
bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result of this
transaction, including the sale of the 33 Fokker 100 aircraft, and the
termination of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements related to the debt
that has been retired, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $68
million. If the certain events described above do not occur, the Company
expects to recognize an additional gain of approximately $37 million in
December 2005.

2. Special charges and U.S. government grant (Continued)

U.S. government grant

In April 2003, the President signed the Emergency Wartime Supplemental
Appropriations Act, 2003 (the Appropriations Act), which includes provisions
authorizing payment of $2.3 billion to reimburse air carriers for increased
security costs in proportion to the amounts each carrier had paid or collected
in passenger security and air carrier security fees to the Transportation
Security Administration (the Security Fee Reimbursement). The Company’s
Security Fee Reimbursement was $358 million (net of payments to independent
regional affiliates) and is included in U.S. government grant in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Appropriations Act also
limits the total cash compensation for the two most highly compensated named
executive officers in 2002 for certain airlines, including the Company, during
the period April 1, 2003 to April 1, 2004 to the amount of salary received by
such officers, or their successors, in 2002. A violation of this executive
compensation provision would require the carrier to repay the government its
Security Fee Reimbursement. The Company does not anticipate any difficulties in
complying with this limitation on executive compensation.

On September 22, 2001, President Bush signed into law the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act). The Company
received a total of $866 million from the U.S. government under the airline
compensation provisions of the Stabilization Act. For the years ended December
31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized approximately $10 million and $856
million, respectively, which is included in U.S. government grant on the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In addition, the Stabilization Act provides for compensation to individual
claimants who were physically injured or killed as a result of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001. Furthermore, the Stabilization Act provides
that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims,
whether compensatory or punitive, arising from the terrorist-related events of
September 11, 2001 against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability
coverage maintained by the air carrier. Based upon estimates provided by the
Company’s insurance providers, the Company recorded a liability of
approximately $2.3 billion for claims arising from the events of September 11,
2001, after considering the liability protections provided for by the
Stabilization Act. The Company has also recorded a liability of approximately
$637 million related to flight 587, which crashed on November 12, 2001. In
addition, the Company has recorded a receivable for these amounts, which the
Company expects to recover from its insurance carriers as claims are resolved.
These insurance receivables and liabilities are classified as Other assets and
Other liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets, respectively, and are based on reserves established by the Company’s
insurance carriers. These estimates may be revised as additional information
becomes available concerning the expected claims. One of the Company’s
insurance carriers has entered liquidation. The carrier provides approximately
five percent of the Company’s coverage related to the events of September 11,
2001 and flight 587, as well as other covered items. This results in
approximately $100 million in receivables, net of reserves, from the insurance
carrier as of December 31, 2003. The Company expects to recover the net
receivable via the liquidation process or other means available.

All short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at
fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, are reflected
as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $166 million in fuel
prepayments and credit card holdback deposits classified as Other current
assets and Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

During 2003, the Company sold its interests in Worldspan, a computer
reservations company, and Hotwire, a discount travel website. The Company
received $180 million in cash and a $39 million promissory note for its
interest in Worldspan. It received $84 million in cash, $80 million of which
was recognized as a gain, for its interest in Hotwire. In addition, during
2003, the Company sold a portion of its interest in Orbitz, a travel planning
website, in connection with an Orbitz initial public offering and a secondary
offering, resulting in total proceeds of $65 million, and a gain of $70
million. The gains on the sale of the Company’s interests in Hotwire and Orbitz
are included in Miscellaneous-net in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations.

4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had commitments to acquire: 36 Embraer
regional jets and six Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2004; an aggregate of 38 Embraer
regional jets in 2005 and 2006; and an aggregate of 47 Boeing 737-800s and nine
Boeing 777-200ERs in 2006 through 2010. Future payments for all aircraft,
including the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate $755
million in 2004, $711 million in 2005, $669 million in 2006 and an aggregate of
approximately $1.9 billion in 2007 through 2010. The Company has pre-arranged
financing or backstop financing for all of its aircraft deliveries through June
2005 (42 aircraft in 2004 and 20 aircraft in 2005).

American has granted Boeing a security interest in American’s purchase deposits
with Boeing. These purchase deposits totaled $277 million as of December 31,
2003.



4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued)

The Company has contracts related to facility construction or improvement
projects, primarily at airport locations. The contractual obligations related
to these projects totaled approximately $600 million as of December 31, 2003.
The Company expects to make payments related to these projects as follows: $250
million in 2004, $188 million in 2005, $93 million in 2006 and $69 million in
2007. In addition, the Company has an information technology support related
contract that requires minimum annual payments of $158 million through 2013.

The Company has capacity purchase agreements with two regional airlines,
Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines, Inc.
(collectively the American Connection carriers) to provide Embraer EMB-140/145
regional jet services to certain markets under the brand “American
Connection”. Under these arrangements, the Company pays the American
Connection carriers a fixed fee per block hour to operate the aircraft. The
block hour fees are designed to cover the American Connection carriers’ fully
allocated costs. Assumptions for highly volatile or uncontrollable costs such
as fuel, landing fees, insurance, and aircraft ownership are trued up to
actual values on a pass through basis. In addition to covering the cost of
operations, the Company also pays a designed profit margin to the American
Connection carriers. In consideration for these payments, the Company retains
all passenger and other revenues resulting from the operation of the American
Connection regional jets. Minimum payments under the contracts are $95
million in 2004, $69 million in 2005, $70 million in 2006, $71 million in 2007
and $20 million in 2008. However, based on expected utilization, the Company
expects to make payments of $162 million in 2004, $164 million in 2005, $166
million in 2006, $168 million in 2007, $170 million in 2008 and $854 million
in 2009 and beyond. In addition, if the Company terminates the Chautauqua
contract without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its Embraer aircraft
to the Company. If this were to happen, the Company would take possession of
the aircraft and become liable for lease obligations totaling approximately
$21 million per year with lease expirations in 2018 and 2019.

The Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general
indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various
risks. The Company is not able to estimate the potential amount of any
liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in
the following paragraphs.

The Company’s loan agreements and other London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR)-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft
leases) generally obligate the Company to reimburse the applicable lender for
incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve
or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with, or credit
extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii) any tax, duty, or other
charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital
adequacy requirements. In addition, the Company’s loan agreements, derivative
contracts and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax
provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to the applicable
lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on
such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable
tax law.

These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire
term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum
additional amounts the Company could be obligated to pay under such provisions.
Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger
an event of default, and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle the
lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due.

In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans
and derivative transactions, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have
rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax law,
illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, the
Company may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant
transaction.

In its aircraft financing agreements, the Company generally indemnifies the
financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other relevant parties
against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing,
manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft
regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the negligence of
the indemnified parties.



4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued)

The Company has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real
estate leases where the Company as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related
parties) against liabilities related to the Company’s use of the leased
property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from
the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In
addition, the Company provides environmental indemnities in many of these
leases for contamination related to the Company’s use of the leased property.

Under certain contracts with third parties, the Company indemnifies the third
party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third party, or
certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential
exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. Generally, the Company
has liability insurance protecting the Company for its obligations it has
undertaken under these indemnities.

AMR and American have event risk covenants in approximately $2.0 billion of
indebtedness and operating leases as of December 31, 2003. These covenants
permit the holders of such obligations to receive a higher rate of return
(between 100 and 650 basis points above the stated rate) if a designated event,
as defined, should occur and the credit ratings of such obligations are
downgraded below certain levels within a certain period of time. No designated
event, as defined, has occurred as of December 31, 2003.

The Company is subject to environmental issues at various other airport and
non-airport locations for which it has accrued $72 million and $92 million,
which are included in Accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Management
believes, after considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition
of these environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on the Company’s current
assessments of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or
decrease as these assessments change.

The Company is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its
operations. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from
these claims and litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

5. Leases

As discussed in Note 2, in 2003, the Company reached concessionary agreements
with certain lessors. The Vendor Agreements with these lessors affected the
payments, lease term, and other conditions of certain leases. As a result of
these changes, 30 leases, which were previously accounted for as operating
leases, were converted to capital leases, and one lease, which was previously
accounted for as a capital lease, was converted to an operating lease. The
Company recorded the new capital leases at the fair value of the respective
assets being leased. These changes did not have a significant effect on the
Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

In addition, certain of the Vendor Agreements provide that the Company’s
obligations under the related lease revert to the original terms if certain
events occur prior to December 31, 2005, including: (i) an event of default
under the related lease (which generally occurs only if a payment default
occurs), (ii) an event of loss with respect to the related aircraft, (iii)
rejection by the Company of the lease under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or (iv) the Company’s filing for bankruptcy under Chapter
7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If any one of these events were to occur, the
Company would be responsible for approximately $24 million in additional
operating lease payments and $11 million in additional payments related to
capital leases as of December 31, 2003. This amount will increase to
approximately $119 million in operating lease payments and $111 million in
payments related to capital leases prior to the expiration of the provision on
December 31, 2005. These amounts are being accounted for as contingent rentals
and will only be recognized if they become payable.



5. Leases (Continued)

AMR’s subsidiaries lease various types of equipment and property, primarily
aircraft and airport facilities. The future minimum lease payments required
under capital leases, together with the present value of such payments, and
future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have initial
or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December
31, 2003, were (in millions):

As of December 31, 2003, included in Accrued liabilities and Other
liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet is approximately $1.3 billion relating to rent expense
being recorded in advance of future operating lease payments.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had 259 jet aircraft and 27 turboprop
aircraft under operating leases and 99 jet aircraft and 13 turboprop aircraft
under capital leases. The aircraft leases can generally be renewed at rates
based on fair market value at the end of the lease term for one to five years.
Some aircraft leases have purchase options at or near the end of the lease term
at fair market value, but generally not to exceed a stated percentage of the
defined lessor’s cost of the aircraft or a predetermined fixed amount.

Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities
primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased
by American and accounted for as operating leases. Approximately $1.8 billion
of these bonds (with total future payments of approximately $4.8 billion as of
December 31, 2003) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both. Approximately $532
million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender
provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to
repurchase the bonds at various times: $112 million in 2004, $104 million in
2005, $28 million in 2006, $100 million in 2007 and $188 million in 2008.
Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no
assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to
redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce
existing rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid facility rentals and
would reduce future operating lease commitments. The special facility revenue
bonds that contain mandatory tender provisions are included in the table above
at their ultimate maturity date rather than their mandatory tender provision
date.

Rent expense, excluding landing fees, was $1.4 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.7
billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.



5. Leases (Continued)

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities”, revised in December 2003, (Interpretation 46),
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE) to include
the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the VIE in its
consolidated financial statements, as well as disclosure of information about
the assets and liabilities, and the nature, purpose and activities of
consolidated variable interest entities. In addition, Interpretation 46
requires disclosure of information about the nature, purpose and activities of
an unconsolidated VIE in which the Company holds a significant variable
interest. The provisions of Interpretation 46 were effective immediately for
any interest in a VIE acquired after January 31, 2003 and beginning in the
fourth quarter of 2003 for any interest in a VIE commonly referred to as
special-purpose entity that was acquired before February 1, 2003. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board deferred the effective date of Interpretation 46 to
the first quarter of 2004 for any other interests in a VIE acquired before
February 1, 2003. Certain entities, including entities established by
municipalities for the purpose of issuing special facility revenue bonds, are
not subject to the provisions of Interpretation 46. In addition, certain
entities with which the Company has capacity purchase agreements are not
considered VIEs, as they are considered businesses as defined by Interpretation
46.

The Company has completed its evaluation of its interests in VIEs, including
certain aircraft operating leases with fixed price purchase options and certain
fuel consortia arrangements. The Company has determined that it holds a
significant variable interest in, but is not the primary beneficiary of,
certain trusts that are the lessor under certain of its aircraft operating
leases (discussed below). Furthermore, the Company has determined that it is
neither the primary beneficiary of, nor holds a significant variable interest
in, any of its various fuel consortia arrangements. As a result,
Interpretation 46 has had no impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations or balance sheet.

American has 88 aircraft operating leases where the lessor is a variable
interest entity — a trust — and the lease contains a fixed price purchase
option, which allows American to purchase the aircraft at a predetermined price
on a specified date. However, American does not guarantee the residual value
of the aircraft. As of December 31, 2003, future lease payments required under
these leases totaled $3.2 billion.

6. Indebtedness (Continued)

American has a fully drawn $834 million bank credit facility that expires
December 15, 2005, which contains a liquidity covenant and an EBITDAR
(generally, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
rentals, adjusted for certain non-cash items) to fixed charges (generally,
interest and total rentals) ratio covenant. The required EBITDAR to fixed
charges ratio is 1.1 to 1.0 for the three-month period ending March 31, 2004,
and increases on a quarterly basis up to 1.5 to 1.0 for each four consecutive
quarters ending after December 31, 2004. The liquidity covenant requires
American to maintain a minimum level of $1.0 billion of unrestricted cash and
short-term investments. The Company expects to be able to continue to comply
with these covenants. However, it cannot be sure that it will continue to be
able to do so through the expiration of the facility. Failure to do so would
result in a default under this facility and a significant amount of American’s
other debt.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, American borrowed approximately $554
million, under seller financed debt agreements, related to the purchase of
aircraft. These debt agreements are secured by the related aircraft and have
effective interest rates, which are fixed and mature over various periods of
time through 2013. As of December 31, 2003, the effective interest rate on
these agreements ranged up to 9.12 percent.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, AMR Eagle borrowed approximately $473
million, under various debt agreements, related to the purchase of regional jet
aircraft, including certain seller financed agreements. These debt agreements
are secured by the related aircraft and have effective interest rates, which
are fixed or variable based on LIBOR plus a spread and mature over various
periods of time through 2020. As of December 31, 2003, the effective interest
rate on these agreements ranged up to 6.73 percent.

In addition, in July 2003, American issued $255 million of enhanced equipment
trust certificates, secured by aircraft, which bear interest at 3.86 percent
and are repayable in semi-annual installments beginning in 2004, with a final
maturity in 2010. These obligations are partially insured by a third party.

In September 2003, the Company issued $300 million principal amount of its 4.25
percent senior convertible notes due 2023 in a private placement. Each note is
convertible into AMR common stock at a conversion rate of 57.61 shares per
$1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an equivalent conversion
price of $17.36 per share), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The
notes are convertible under certain circumstances, including if (i) the closing
sale price of the Company’s common stock reaches a certain level for a
specified period of time, (ii) the trading price of the notes as a percentage
of the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock falls below a certain
level for a specified period of time, (iii) the Company calls the notes for
redemption, or (iv) certain corporate transactions occur. Holders of the notes
may require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the notes on
September 23, 2008, 2013 and 2018 at a purchase price equal to the principal
amount of the notes being purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of purchase. The Company may pay the purchase price in cash, common stock
or a combination of cash and common stock. After September 23, 2008, the
Company may redeem all or any portion of the notes for cash at a price equal to
the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest as of the redemption date. These notes are guaranteed by American.

Also in September 2003, American transferred its two headquarters buildings
located in Fort Worth, Texas to AA Real Estate Holding L.P., a wholly owned
consolidated subsidiary of American. This entity leased the buildings back to
American pursuant to a triple-net lease, and used the buildings and the lease
as security for a loan consisting of four notes, in the amount of $98 million
(net of discount of $2 million), which is reflected as debt in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet of the Company. Each note corresponds to a separate
class of AA/Ft. Worth HQ Finance Trust Lease Revenue Commercial Mortgage-Backed
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2003 (the Certificates) issued by the AA/Ft.
Worth HQ Finance Trust, which is not a subsidiary of American, in a private
placement pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The
Certificates and corresponding notes have an average effective interest rate of
7.2 percent and a final maturity in 2010.



6. Indebtedness (Continued)

In 2002, the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation and the New York City
Industrial Development Agency issued facilities sublease revenue bonds at the
Los Angeles International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport,
respectively, to provide reimbursement to American for certain facility
construction and other related costs. The Company has recorded the total
amount of the issuances of $759 million (net of $38 million discount) as
long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2002. These obligations bear interest at fixed rates, with an average
effective rate of 8.54 percent, and mature over various periods of time, with
a final maturity in 2028. The Company has received approximately $687 million
in reimbursements of certain facility construction and other related costs
through December 31, 2003. Of the remaining $72 million of bond issuance
proceeds not yet received, classified as Other assets on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet, $25 million are held by the trustee for
reimbursement of future facility construction costs and will be available to
the Company in the future, and $47 million are held in a debt service reserve
fund.

Certain debt is secured by aircraft, engines, equipment and other assets having
a net book value of approximately $12.6 billion.

As of December 31, 2003, AMR has issued guarantees covering approximately $932
million of American’s tax-exempt bond debt and American has issued guarantees
covering approximately $936 million of AMR’s unsecured debt, including the 4.25
percent senior convertible notes discussed above. In addition, as of December
31, 2003, AMR and American have issued guarantees covering approximately $503
million of AMR Eagle’s secured debt, and AMR has issued guarantees covering an
additional $1.9 billion of AMR Eagle’s secured debt.

Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were $661 million,
$564 million and $343 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In February 2004, American issued $180 million of Fixed Rate Secured Notes due
2009. These notes are secured by certain spare parts and bear interest at 7.25
percent. Also in February 2004, AMR issued, and American guaranteed, $324
million of 4.5 percent senior convertible notes due 2024.

7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management

As part of the Company’s risk management program, AMR uses a variety of
financial instruments, including fuel swap and option contracts and interest
rate swaps. Prior to September 2002, the Company also used currency option
contracts and exchange agreements. The Company does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by
counterparties to these financial instruments, but it does not expect any of
the counterparties to fail to meet its obligations. The credit exposure
related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of
contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date, reduced by the
effects of master netting agreements. To manage credit risks, the Company
selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single
counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the
program and its relative market position with each counterparty. The Company
also maintains industry-standard security agreements with a number of its
counterparties which may require the Company or the counterparty to post
collateral if the value of selected instruments exceed specified mark-to-market
thresholds or upon certain changes in credit ratings. The Company’s outstanding
posted collateral as of December 31, 2003 is included in restricted cash and
short-term investments and is not material. The Company’s credit rating has
limited its ability to enter into certain types of fuel hedge contracts. A
further deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position may negatively
affect the Company’s ability to hedge fuel in the future.



7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Continued)

Fuel Price Risk Management

American enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude oil swap and option
contracts to dampen the impact of the volatility in jet fuel prices. These
instruments generally have maturities of up to 24 months. The Company accounts
for its fuel swap and option contracts as cash flow hedges and records the fair
value of its fuel hedging contracts in Other current assets, Other assets and
Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The Company determines the ineffective portion of its fuel hedge
contracts by comparing the cumulative change in the total value of the fuel
hedge contract, or group of fuel hedge contracts, to the cumulative change in
the forecasted value of the jet fuel being hedged. If the total cumulative
change in value of the fuel hedge contract more than offsets the total
cumulative change in the forecasted value of the jet fuel being hedged, the
difference is considered ineffective and is immediately recognized as a
component of Aircraft fuel expense. Effective gains or losses on fuel hedging
contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are
recognized in earnings as a component of Aircraft fuel expense when the
underlying jet fuel being hedged is used.

The Company monitors the commodities used in its fuel hedging programs to
determine that these commodities are expected to be “highly effective” in
offsetting changes in its forecasted jet fuel prices. In doing so, the Company
uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the percentage change
in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (i.e., WTI Crude oil and
NYMEX Heating oil) to the percentage change in prices of jet fuel over a 12 to
24 month period. The fuel hedge contracts are deemed to be “highly effective”
if this correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent.

Beginning in March 2003, because of the Company’s then existing financial
condition, the Company stopped entering into new hedge contracts and, in June
2003, terminated substantially all of its contracts with maturities beyond
March 2004. The termination of these contracts resulted in the collection of
approximately $41 million in settlement of the contracts. The gain on these
contracts will continue to be deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss
and recognized in earnings when the original underlying jet fuel hedged is
used. Commencing in October 2003, the Company began to enter into new option
contracts with maturities beyond March 2004 for a portion of its future fuel
requirements.

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized
net gains of approximately $149 million, $4 million and $29 million,
respectively, as a component of fuel expense on the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations related to its fuel hedging agreements. The net gains
recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001 included approximately $1 million, $13
million and $72 million, respectively, of expense related to ineffectiveness.
The fair value of the Company’s fuel hedging agreements at December 31, 2003
and 2002, representing the amount the Company would receive to terminate the
agreements, totaled $54 million and $212 million, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk Management

American uses interest rate swap contracts to effectively convert a portion of
its fixed-rate capital lease obligations to floating-rate obligations. The
Company accounts for its interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges
whereby the fair value of the related interest rate swap agreement is reflected
in Other assets with the corresponding liability being recorded as a component
of Obligations Under Capital Leases on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The Company has no ineffectiveness with regard to its interest rate
swap contracts. The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements
related to capital lease obligations, representing the amount the Company would
receive if the agreements were terminated at December 31, 2003 and 2002, was
approximately $9 million and $14 million, respectively.



7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Continued)

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The Company has entered into Japanese yen currency exchange agreements to hedge
certain yen-based capital lease obligations (effectively converting these
obligations into dollar-based obligations). The Company accounts for its
Japanese yen currency exchange agreements as cash flow hedges whereby the fair
value of the related Japanese yen currency exchange agreements is reflected in
Other liabilities and deferred credits and Accumulated other comprehensive loss
on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company has no
ineffectiveness with regard to its Japanese yen currency exchange agreements.
The fair values of the Company’s yen currency exchange agreements, representing
the amount the Company would pay to terminate the agreements, were $33 million
and $44 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The exchange
rates on the Japanese yen agreements range from 66.5 to 105.1 yen per U.S.
dollar.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt were estimated using quoted
market prices where available. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair
values were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the
Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s
long-term debt, including current maturities, were (in millions):

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS
covering tax years 1990 through 1995 and, as a result, recorded an $80 million
tax benefit to reduce previously accrued income tax liabilities.

The income tax benefit for loss before cumulative effect of accounting change
differed from amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate as
follows (in millions):

(994

The deferred tax assets not
benefited in 2003 relate primarily to net operating loss
carryforwards. The deferred tax assets not benefited in 2002 related to the Company’s uncertainty
regarding the realization of the foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net
operating losses, and in 2001 related to the
Company’s uncertainty regarding the realization of the foreign tax credit
carryforwards.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2003, the recording of other comprehensive
income items, primarily the minimum pension liability, resulted in a decrease
to the net deferred tax asset. The Company recorded a $111 million reduction to
the valuation allowance as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income related to such net deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2002, the
recording of other comprehensive income items, primarily the minimum pension
liability, resulted in a net deferred tax asset. The Company recorded a $313
million valuation allowance as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income related to such net deferred tax asset. The total change in
the valuation allowance was $293 million and $363 million
in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will
not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or
all of the deferred tax assets, will be realized. The ultimate realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
(including reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which
those temporary differences will become deductible.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had available for federal income tax purposes
an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $427 million,
which is available for an indefinite period, and federal net operating losses
of approximately $2.9 billion for regular tax purposes, which will fully
expire, if unused, in 2022 and 2023. The Company had available for state income
tax purposes net operating losses of $2.9 billion, which expire, if unused, in
years 2005 through 2023.

Cash refunds for income taxes were $575 million, $646 million and $28 million
for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The amounts received in 2003 and 2002
relate primarily to net operating loss carryback claims, including a carryback
claim filed as a result of a provision in Congress’ economic stimulus package
that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs). This
change allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years,
rather than two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more
quickly recover its NOLs.

9. Stock Awards and Options

In March 2003, the Board of Directors of AMR approved the issuance of
additional shares of AMR common stock to employees and Vendors in connection
with negotiations concerning concessions. The maximum number of shares
authorized for issuance was 30 percent of the number of shares of the Company’s
common stock outstanding on March 24, 2003 (156,359,955) or approximately 46.9
million shares. From the foregoing authorization, the Company issued
approximately 2.5 million shares to Vendors from treasury stock, resulting in a
re-allocation from Treasury stock to Additional paid-in capital of $142
million.

In 2003, the Company established the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the
2003 Plan) to provide equity awards to employees in connection with the Labor
Agreements and Management Reductions discussed in Note 2. Under the 2003 Plan,
employees may be granted stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock.
The total number of shares authorized for distribution under the 2003 Plan is
42,680,000 shares.



9. Stock Awards and Options (Continued)

Under the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, officers and key employees
of AMR and its subsidiaries may be granted stock options, stock appreciation
rights (SARs), restricted stock, deferred stock, stock purchase rights, other
stock-based awards and/or performance-related awards, including cash bonuses.
The total number of common shares authorized for distribution under the 1998
Long Term Incentive Plan is 23,700,000 shares. The 1998 Long Term Incentive
Plan, the successor to the 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, will terminate no
later than May 21, 2008.

Options granted under the 1988 and 1998 Long Term Incentive Plans
(collectively, the LTIP Plans) and the 2003 Plan are awarded with an exercise
price equal to the fair market value of the stock on date of grant, become
exercisable in equal annual installments over periods ranging from two to five
years following the date of grant and expire no later than ten years from the
date of grant. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 7.1 million shares were
available for future grant under the LTIP Plans and the 2003 Plan.

In May 1997, in conjunction with a labor agreement reached between American and
members of the Allied Pilots Association (APA), the Company established the
Pilots Stock Option Plan (The Pilot Plan). The Pilot Plan granted members of
the APA the option to purchase 11.5 million shares of AMR stock at $41.69 per
share, $5 less than the average fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. These shares were exercisable immediately. In conjunction with the
Sabre spin-off, the exercise price was adjusted to $17.59 per share.

Stock option activity under the LTIP Plans, the Pilot Plan and the 2003 Plan
was:

The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of performance share
awards granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $10.50, $25.98 and $28.27,
respectively.

In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the total charge for stock compensation expense
included in wages, salaries and benefits expense, primarily related to the
Company’s performance share plan, was $20 million, $9 million and $21 million,
respectively. No compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants
under the LTIP Plans or the 2003 Plan, since the exercise price was equal to
the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.



10. Retirement Benefits

All regular employees of the Company are eligible to participate in pension
plans. The defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees
based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period of
time before retirement. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all
of its defined benefit plans. Airline pilots also participate in a defined
contribution plan for which Company contributions are determined as a
percentage of participant compensation.

Effective January 1, 2001, American established a defined contribution plan for
non-contract employees in which the Company will match the employees before-tax
contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to 5.5 percent of their
pensionable pay. During 2000, American provided a one-time election for
current non-contract employees to remain in the defined benefit plan or
discontinue accruing future credited service in the defined benefit plan as of
January 1, 2001 and begin participation in the defined contribution plan.
Effective January 1, 2002, all new non-contract employees of the Company become
members of the defined contribution plan.

In addition to pension benefits, other postretirement benefits, including
certain health care and life insurance benefits (which provide secondary
coverage to Medicare), are provided to retired employees. The amount of health
care benefits is limited to lifetime maximums as outlined in the plan.
Substantially all regular employees of American and employees of certain other
subsidiaries may become eligible for these benefits if they satisfy eligibility
requirements during their working lives.

Certain employee groups make contributions toward funding a portion of their
retiree health care benefits during their working lives. AMR funds benefits as
incurred and makes contributions to match employee prefunding.

In connection with the acquisition of TWA in April 2001, the Company assumed
certain retiree benefit plan liabilities of TWA, primarily its postretirement
benefit obligation. As such, the following information reflects the inclusion
of these obligations from the date of acquisition. In addition, effective
January 1, 2002, TWA LLC employees were eligible to begin participation in
American’s pension plans. However, these employees were not granted prior
credited service.

In the second quarter of 2003, as a result of the Labor Agreements and
Management Reductions discussed in Note 2, the Company remeasured its defined
benefit pension plans. The significant actuarial assumptions used for the
remeasurement were the same as those used as of December 31, 2002, except for
the discount rate and salary scale, which were lowered to 6.50 percent, and
2.78 percent through 2008 and 3.78 percent thereafter, respectively. In
addition, assumptions with respect to interest rates used to discount lump sum
benefit payments available under certain plans were updated. As a result of
workforce reductions related to the Labor Agreements and Management Reductions,
the Company recognized a curtailment loss of $46 million related to its defined
benefit pension plans, which is included in Special charges in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. Net periodic benefit cost for defined
benefit pension plans includes eight months of expense calculated based upon
the revised measurement.

In December 2003, the President signed the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Modernization Act), which
introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, into law. In January
2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a FASB Staff
Position which permits companies to elect to defer accounting for the effects
of the Modernization Act. The Company has not elected this deferral and has
recognized the effect of the Modernization Act in the calculation of its
postretirement benefit liability as of December 31, 2003. The effect of the
Modernization Act was to reduce the Company’s accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation (APBO) by $415 million by decreasing unrecognized net
actuarial losses. This decrease is due to a reduction in the expected per
capita claims cost along with a reduction in the expected rates of
participation in the plan. The decrease in the APBO will be reflected in the
Company’s postretirement benefits expense in future periods through
amortization of unrecognized gains/losses. Additionally, the service and
interest cost components of postretirement benefits expense will be reduced in
future periods. Final authoritative guidance on accounting for the
Modernization Act has not been issued and could require the Company to change
previously reported information.

The Company estimates the long-term rate of return on plan assets will be nine
percent, based on the target asset allocation as of December 31, 2003.
Expected returns on longer duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of
the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are based on a
combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets
achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and
expected value to be generated through active management, currency overlay and
securities lending programs. The Company’s annualized ten-year rate of return
on plan assets, as of December 31, 2003, is approximately 10.5 percent.

The Company’s pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December 31,
by asset category, are as follows:



Long duration bonds


%


%

U.S. stocks



International stocks



Emerging markets stocks and bonds



Alternative (private) investments



Total


%


%

The Company’s target asset allocation is 40 percent longer duration corporate
and U.S. government/agency bonds, 25 percent U.S. stocks, 20 percent developed
international stocks, five percent emerging markets stocks and bonds, and ten
percent alternative (private) investments. Each asset class is actively managed
and has produced returns in excess of the expected rate over the last ten
years, net of management fees. Stocks and emerging market bonds are used to
provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the
long-term than longer duration U.S. bonds. Public stocks are managed using a
value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by
stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. Longer
duration U.S. bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in
interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected
returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. Additionally, the
Company engages currency overlay managers in an attempt to increase returns by
protecting non-U.S. dollar denominated assets from a rise in the relative value
of the U.S. dollar. The Company also participates in securities lending
programs in order to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to
borrowers on a fully collateralized basis.

The Company expects to contribute approximately $600 million to its defined

2004. The Company’s estimate of its 2004 defined benefit pension plan
contributions assumes Congress passes legislation providing certain technical
corrections to current Employee Retirement Income Security Act pension plan
funding requirements. Congress is also considering other legislation that, if
passed, would further reduce the Company’s 2004 minimum funding requirements.

11. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS
142). SFAS 142 requires the Company to test goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets (for AMR, route acquisition costs) for impairment rather than
amortize them. In so doing, the Company determined its entire goodwill balance
of $1.4 billion was impaired. In arriving at this conclusion, the Company’s net
book value was determined to be in excess of the Company’s fair value at
January 1, 2002, using AMR as the reporting unit for purposes of the fair value
determination. The Company determined its fair value as of January 1, 2002
using market capitalization as the primary indicator of fair value. As a
result, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge, effective January 1,
2002, of $988 million ($6.35 per share, net of a tax benefit of $363 million)
to write-off all of AMR’s goodwill. The tax benefit of $363 million differed
from the amount computed at the statutory federal income tax rate due to a
portion of AMR’s goodwill not being deductible for federal tax purposes. The
charge is nonoperational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of
accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The pro forma effect of discontinuing amortization of goodwill and route
acquisition costs under SFAS 142 — assuming the Company had adopted this
standard as of January 1, 2001 — results in an adjusted net loss of
approximately $1,722 million, or $11.17 per share for the year ended December
31, 2001.

The Company had route acquisition costs (including international slots) of $829
million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The Company’s impairment analysis for
route acquisition costs did not result in an impairment charge in 2003 or 2002.

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 14 million,
four million and 11 million potential dilutive shares, respectively, were not
added to the denominator because inclusion of such shares would be
antidilutive. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2003, approximately
17 million shares issuable upon conversion of the Company’s 4.25 percent
convertible notes discussed in Note 6 were not added to the denominator because
the inclusion of such shares would be antidilutive.

14. Segment Reporting

The Company’s operations of American and AMR Eagle are managed as a single
business unit providing for an integrated route network. The aircraft of these
carriers are combined to form one fleet, which is deployed through a combined
route scheduling system to maximize the operating results of the entire fleet.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation
decisions to maximize the Company’s consolidated financial results, not the
individual results of American or AMR Eagle. Based on the way the Company’s
operations are managed and the manner in which resource allocation decisions
are made, the Company has only one operating segment consisting of the
operations of American and AMR Eagle.

Following the acquisition of TWA in April 2001, American is the largest
scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2003, American
provided scheduled jet service to approximately 150 destinations throughout
North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. American
is also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world,
providing a full range of freight and mail services to shippers throughout its
system. AMR Eagle owns two regional airlines, which do business as “American
Eagle” — American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. The
American Eagle carriers provide connecting service from eight of American’s
high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the United States, Canada,
and the Caribbean.

Revenues from other segments are below the quantitative threshold for
determining reportable segments and consist primarily of revenues from AMR
Investment Services, Inc. and Americas Ground Services, Inc. The difference
between the financial information of the Company’s one reportable segment and
the financial information included in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations and balance sheets as a result of these entities is not material.

consist primarily of flight equipment, which is mobile across geographic
markets and, therefore, has not been allocated.

In addition to the above items, in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
reached an agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995. As a
result of this agreement, the Company recorded an $80 million tax benefit to
reduce previously accrued income tax liabilities and an $84 million reduction
in interest expense to reduce previously accrued interest related to the
accrued income tax liabilities.

Also in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized an $80 million gain
on the sale of the Company’s investment in Hotwire and a $70 million gain
related to an Orbitz initial public offering and a related secondary offering.

Furthermore, during the second quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $57
million charge for the displacement of foreign tax credits resulting from a
provision in Congress’ economic stimulus package. The provision changed the
period for carrybacks of NOLs from two to five years and allowed the Company to
more quickly recover its NOLs. However, the extended NOL carryback resulted in
the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.



ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. This
term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2003. Based on
that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2003. There have been no significant changes in the Company’s
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal
controls over financial reporting.
