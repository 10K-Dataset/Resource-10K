BUSINESS

CORPORATE

OVERVIEW

History,
      Business, and Recent Results

Eastman
      Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company") is a global chemical company
      which
      manufactures and sells a broad portfolio of chemicals, plastics, and fibers.
      Eastman began business in 1920 for the purpose of producing chemicals for
      Eastman Kodak Company's photographic business and became a public company,
      incorporated in Delaware, as of December 31, 1993. Eastman has 17 manufacturing
      sites in 10 countries that supply chemicals, plastics, and fibers products
      to
      customers throughout the world. The Company's headquarters and largest
      manufacturing site are located in Kingsport, Tennessee.

In
      2005,
      the Company had sales revenue of $7.1 billion, operating earnings of $757
      million, and net earnings of $557 million. Earnings per diluted share were
      $6.81
      in 2005. Included in 2005 operating earnings were asset impairments and
      restructuring charges of $33 million and other operating income of $2 million.

The
      Company’s products and operations are managed and reported in six operating
      segments aligned into three divisions: Eastman, Voridian and Developing
      Businesses. Eastman Division consists of the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty
      Polymers, and Inks (“CASPI”) segment, the Performance Chemicals and
      Intermediates (“PCI”) segment and the Specialty Plastics (“SP”) segment.
      Voridian Division consists of the Polymers segment and the Fibers segment.
      Developing Businesses Division consists of the Developing Businesses (“DB”)
      segment. A segment is determined primarily by the customer markets in which
      it
      sells its products and services. For additional information related to the
      Company’s operating segments, see Note 21 to the Company’s consolidated
      financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form
      10K.

On
      March
      6, 2006, the Company announced a realignment of its organizational structure
      and
      related senior management assignments effective April 1, 2006. The new structure
      combines related assets and technologies to facilitate growth in the Company's
      core businesses and take full advantage of new growth opportunities by focusing
      on common technologies and streams. The new organization replaces the Eastman
      and Voridian divisions with the Chemicals and Fibers Group and the Polyesters
      Group. The Chemicals and Fibers Group consists of CASPI, PCI, and Fibers
      segments. The Polyesters Group consists of SP and Polymers segments.

Manufacturing
      Streams

Eastman's
      objective is to leverage its heritage of expertise and innovation in acetyl,
      polyester, and olefins chemistries to drive growth, meet increasing demand
      and
      create new opportunities for the Company's products in key markets including
      packaging, tobacco, durable goods, building and construction, and others. For
      each of these chemistries, Eastman has developed a combination of assets and
      technologies that are operated within three manufacturing 'streams'. In the
      acetyl stream, the Company begins with high sulfur coal which is then gasified
      in its coal gasification facility. The resulting synthesis gas is converted
      into
      a number of chemicals including methanol, methyl acetate, acetic acid and acetic
      anhydride. These chemicals are used in products throughout the Company including
      acetate tow, acetate yarn and cellulose esters. The Company's ability to use
      coal is a competitive advantage for raw materials and energy. The Company is
      investigating opportunities to further leverage its coal-based process know-how
      in an effort referred to as "chemicals from coal". In the polyester stream,
      the
      Company begins with purchased paraxylene and produces purified terephthalic
      acid
      ("PTA") and dimethyl terephthalate ("DMT") which are the starting raw materials
      of most of its polyester competitors. PTA or DMT is then reacted with ethylene
      glycol, which the Company both makes and purchases, along with other ingredients
      (some of which the Company makes and are proprietary) to produce polyethylene
      terephthalate ("PET") and copolyesters. This backward integration of its
      polyester manufacturing provides several competitive advantages. For PET, this
      allows Eastman a cost advantage in a commodity market. For copolyester, Eastman
      adds a specialty monomer to provide clear, tough, chemically resistant product
      characteristics. As a result, the Company's copolyesters can compete with
      materials such as polycarbonate and acrylic. In the olefins stream, the Company
      begins primarily with propane and ethane, which are then cracked at its facility
      in Longview, Texas into propylene and ethylene. The propylene is used in oxo
      derivative products, while the ethylene is primarily used in polyethylene
      products.

Cyclicality
      and Seasonality

Certain
      segments, particularly the PCI and Polymers segments, are impacted by the
      cyclicality of key products and markets, while other segments are more sensitive
      to global economic conditions. Supply and demand dynamics determine
      profitability at different stages of cycles and global economic conditions
      affect the length of each cycle. Despite some sensitivity to global economic
      conditions, many of the products in the Fibers, CASPI and SP segments provide
      a
      stable foundation of earnings.

The
      Company typically experiences seasonality in its earnings and cash flows. The
      Company's earnings are typically higher in the second and third quarters, while
      cash from operations is stronger in the first and fourth quarters. Demand for
      CASPI segment products is typically stronger in the second and third quarters
      due to increased use of coatings products in the building and construction
      industries, while demand is weaker during the winter months because of seasonal
      construction downturns. The PCI segment typically experiences a weaker fourth
      quarter, due in part to a downturn in demand for products used in certain
      building and construction and agricultural markets. The Polymers segment
      typically experiences stronger demand for PET polymers for beverage plastics
      during the second and early third quarters due to higher consumption of
      beverages in the Northern hemisphere, while demand typically weakens during
      the
      late third and fourth quarters.


EASTMAN
      DIVISION

Business
      and Industry Overview

Operating
      in a variety of markets with varying growth prospects and competitive factors,
      the segments in Eastman Division manufacture a diverse portfolio of specialty
      and commodity chemicals and plastics that are used in a wide range of consumer
      and industrial markets. Eastman Division has 13 manufacturing sites in 8
      countries, selling more than 1,650 products to more than 3,500 customers.
      Eastman Division is comprised of the CASPI, PCI, and SP segments, which are
      more
      fully discussed below.

Strategy

The
      Company’s objectives for Eastman Division are to exploit growth opportunities in
      core businesses and improve gross margins.

·

Exploit
                Growth Opportunities in Core
                Businesses

Ø

Develop
                New Specialty Products and Expand into New
                Markets

The
      Company believes that it is a market leader based on sales in a number of
      Eastman Division’s product lines. The Division is focused on growth through
      continued innovation and displacement of competitive products with offerings
      that provide greater functionality or better value. This includes development
      of
      new products for existing applications, and expansion into new applications
      with
      existing products.

Ø

Leverage
                Opportunities Created by the Broad Product
                Line

Eastman
      Division is able to offer a broad array of complementary products that customers
      would otherwise need to obtain from multiple manufacturers. Its diverse
      portfolio and integrated manufacturing assets allow Eastman Division to benefit
      from advancements and developments with respect to one product line by applying
      them to other product lines. For example, efficiency is created through the
      operation of large integrated plants that produce numerous products, which
      are
      used in, or sold by, multiple Eastman segments. This allows a customer to place
      an order for multiple products, which may be produced by different segments,
      and
      have them delivered from the same location, reducing costs and order time.
      Additionally, Eastman continues to leverage the advantages of being an
      integrated polyester manufacturer. One opportunity identified is scaled
      differentiation in the polyester stream, which is the potential for SP to
      utilize rationalized PET assets, as a result of the new

IntegRex

facility, to reduce copolyester conversion cost. This would be expected to
      leverage the synergies of the Polymers segment's advantaged cost structure
      and
      the SP segment's potential to expand quickly into higher value growth
      markets.

Ø

Diversify
                Globally and Pursue Opportunities for Business
                Development

Eastman
      Division currently has in place and continues to pursue opportunities for joint
      ventures, equity investments and other alliances.

These
      strategic initiatives are expected to diversify and strengthen businesses by
      providing access to new markets and high-growth areas as well as providing
      an
      efficient means of ensuring that Eastman is involved in diverse technological
      innovations in or related to the chemicals industry. The Company is committed
      to
      pursuing these initiatives in order to capitalize on new business concepts
      that
      differentiate it from other chemical manufacturers and that will provide
      incremental growth beyond what is organic to the chemicals industry and at
      lower
      capital investment. For example, Eastman is expanding its manufacturing joint
      venture in Nanjing, China to meet the growing demand in Asia for hydrocarbon
      resins in adhesives formulations. Additionally, Eastman is increasing
      copolyester intermediates capacity in order to meet expected growth in global
      demand.

·

Improve
                Gross Margins

Eastman
      Division continues to work to maximize the value of core businesses by improving
      gross margins through:

Ø

Enhancing
                pricing processes and strategies, and implementing pricing systems
                to
                improve responsiveness to changes in operating costs and other factors
                impacting gross margins;


Ø

Institutionalizing
                    cost reduction processes, including a Six Sigma quality improvement
                    program aimed at reducing costs, improving customer satisfaction,
                    improving efficiency through reduction of variations and defects,
                    and
                    focusing on business simplification and channels to
                    market;

Ø

Implementing
                  information technology solutions to maximize the Company’s enterprise
                  resource planning system used in production planning and other
                  manufacturing processes to reduce safety stock, improve responsiveness
                  to
                  demand forecasting, and increase manufacturing efficiency;
                  and

Ø

Maintaining
                  high utilization of manufacturing assets, particularly for intermediates
                  and specialty polymers, and pursuing high value debottlenecking
                  opportunities and incremental expansions of current
                  assets.

Related
        to the above activities, the Company continues to evaluate its portfolio
        of
        products and businesses in Eastman Division, which could result in further
        restructuring, divestiture, or consolidation, particularly in the PCI segment.

CASPI
        SEGMENT

·

Overview

The
        CASPI
        segment manufactures liquid vehicles, additives, specialty polymers, and
        other
        raw materials which are integral to the production of paints and coatings,
        inks,
        adhesives, and other formulated products. The CASPI segment focuses on producing
        raw materials rather than finished products in order to develop long-term,
        strategic relationships and achieve preferred supplier status with its
        customers. Growth in these markets in North America and Europe typically
        approximates economic growth in general, due to the wide variety of end uses
        for
        these applications and dependence on the economic conditions of the markets
        for
        durable goods, packaged goods, automobiles, and housing. However, higher
        growth
        sub-markets exist within North America and Europe, driven by customers' growing
        demands for performance requirements that are protective of the environment
        and
        meet increasingly more stringent government regulation. For example, the
        coatings and adhesives industries are promoting products and technologies
        designed to reduce air emissions. Growth in Asia and Latin America is
        substantially higher than general economic growth, driven primarily by the
        increasing government regulations in industrializing economies.

In
        2005,
        the CASPI segment had sales revenue of $1.3 billion, which represented 18
        percent of Eastman’s total sales and 36 percent of Eastman Division’s total
        sales.

·

Products

The
        CASPI
        segment's products consist of:

Ø

Coatings
                  Additives and Solvents

The
        additives product lines consist of differentiated and proprietary products
        such
        as: cellulosic polymers, which enhance the aesthetic appeal and improve the
        performance and metallic flake orientation of industrial and automotive original
        equipment and refinish coatings and inks; Texanol™ ester alcohol, which improves
        film formation and durability in architectural latex paints; and chlorinated
        polyolefins, which promote the adherence of paints and coatings to plastic
        substrates. Solvents, which consist of ester, ketone, glycol ether and alcohol
        solvents, are used in both paints and inks to maintain the formulation in
        liquid
        form for ease of application. Environmental regulations that impose limits
        on
        the emission of hazardous air pollutants continue to impact coatings
        formulations requiring compliant coatings raw materials. Eastman’s coatings
        additives and solvents are currently used in compliant coatings. Additional
        products are under development to meet the growing demand for waterborne
        (latex)
        and high solids coatings that are more protective of the environment. Coatings
        additives and solvents comprised 59 percent of the CASPI segment’s total sales
        for 2005.


Ø

Adhesives
                  Raw Materials

The
        adhesives product line consists of hydrocarbon resins, rosin resins, resin
        dispersions, and polymer raw materials. These products are sold to adhesive
        formulators and tape and label manufacturers for use as raw materials in
        hot
        melt and pressure sensitive adhesives and as binders in nonwoven products
        (such
        as disposable diapers, feminine products, and pre-saturated wipes). Eastman
        has
        a leadership position in hydrogenated gum rosins used in adhesive and chewing
        gum applications. Eastman offers the broadest product portfolio of raw materials
        for the adhesives industry, ranking as the second largest global tackifier
        supplier. Adhesives raw materials comprised 41 percent of the CASPI segment’s
        total sales for 2005.

The
        profitability of CASPI products is sensitive to the global economy, exchange
        rates, and market trends and broader chemical cycles, particularly the olefins
        cycle. CASPI's specialty products, which include coatings additives,
        coalescents, and selected hydrocarbon resins, are less sensitive to the olefins
        cycle due to their functional performance attributes. The cyclical commodity
        products, which include commodity solvents and polymer raw materials, are
        impacted by the olefins cycle. The Company leverages its proprietary
        technologies, competitive cost structure and integrated manufacturing facilities
        to maintain a strong competitive position throughout such cycles.

Strategy

A
        key
        element of the CASPI segment growth strategy is the continued development
        of
        innovative product offerings, building on proprietary technologies in
        high-growth markets and regions that meet customers’ evolving needs and improve
        the quality and performance of customers’ end products. Eastman Division
        believes that its ability to leverage its broad product line and research
        and
        development capabilities across this segment make it uniquely capable of
        offering a broad array of solutions for new and emerging markets. CASPI is
        pursuing high value incremental expansions of current manufacturing assets
        to
        ensure that adequate capacity is available to meet the increasing demand
        for its
        differentiated products.

The
        CASPI
        segment is focused on the expansion of the coatings and inks additives and
        solvents product offerings into other high-growth areas. These include market
        areas with growth due to specific market trends and product developments,
        such
        as high solids and water-based coatings and inks, as well as growth in
        geographic areas due to the level and timing of industrial development. The
        Company's global manufacturing presence positions it to take advantage of
        areas
        of high industrial growth, particularly in Asia from its facility in Singapore
        and joint venture operations in China.

The
        CASPI
        segment is also focused on the expansion of the adhesives raw materials product
        offerings into high-growth markets and regions by leveraging applications
        technology and increasing production capacity. The segment expects to take
        advantage of growth in demand for specialty hydrocarbon resins through the
        percent expansion of manufacturing operations in Middelburg, the Netherlands,
        and in the developing regions through the 30 percent expansion of hydrocarbon
        resin production capacity at its joint venture operation in Nanjing, China.
        Additionally, the CASPI segment has improved profitability within this group
        of
        product lines through cost reduction initiatives and other projects that
        leverage best manufacturing practices, infrastructure, and business processes.

The
        Company intends to continue to leverage its resources to strengthen its CASPI
        innovation pipeline through improved market connect and the expanded use
        of
        proprietary products and technologies. Although CASPI sales and application
        development is often specialized by end-use market, developments in technology
        may be successfully shared across multiple end-uses and markets.


·

Customers
                    and Markets

As
        a
        result of the variety of end uses for its products, the customer base in
        the
        CASPI segment is broad and diverse. This segment has more than 1,500 customers
        around the world, and approximately 80 percent of its sales revenue in 2005
        was
        attributable to approximately 100 customers. CASPI focuses on establishing
        long-term, customer service-oriented relationships with its strategic customers
        in order to become their preferred supplier and to leverage these relationships
        to pursue sales opportunities in previously underserved markets, as well
        as
        expand the scope of its value-added services. However, from time to time,
        customers decide to develop products internally or diversify their sources
        of
        supply that had been provided by Eastman. Growth in North American and European
        markets typically coincide with economic growth in general, due to the wide
        variety of end uses for these applications and their dependence on the economic
        conditions of the markets for durable goods, packaged goods, automobiles,
        and
        housing.

·

Competition

Competition
        within the CASPI segment's markets varies widely depending on the specific
        product or product group. Because of the depth and breadth of its product
        offerings, Eastman does not believe that any one of its competitors presently
        offers all of the products that it manufactures within the CASPI segment.
        However, many of the Company’s competitors within portions of its CASPI segment
        are substantially larger companies, such as Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”), BASF
        and Exxon Mobil Corporation, which have greater financial and other resources
        than those of Eastman. Additionally, within each market in this segment,
        the
        Company competes with other smaller, regionally focused companies that may
        have
        advantages based on location, local market knowledge, manufacturing strength
        in
        a specific product, or other factors. At any time, any one or more of these
        competitors could develop additional products that compete with, or that
        may
        make obsolete, some of Eastman’s current product offerings.

Eastman
        does not believe that any of its competitors is dominant within the CASPI
        segment's markets. Further, the Company attempts to maintain competitive
        advantages through its level of vertical integration, breadth of product
        and
        technology offerings, low-cost manufacturing position, consistent product
        quality, and process and market knowledge. In addition, Eastman attempts
        to
        leverage its strong customer base and long-standing customer relationships
        to
        promote substantial recurring business, further strengthening its competitive
        position.

PCI
        SEGMENT

·

Overview

The
        Company’s PCI segment manufactures diversified products that are sold
        externally, as well as used internally by other segments. PCI's earnings
        are
        highly dependent on how the Company chooses to optimize the olefins stream,
        and,
        to a lesser extent, the acetyls stream. In 2005, the PCI segment had external
        sales revenue of $1.6 billion, which represented 23 percent of Eastman’s total
        sales and 44 percent of Eastman Division's total sales. Additionally, the
        PCI
        segment had interdivisional sales revenue for 2005 of $665 million.

·

Products

The
        PCI
        segment offers over 150 products that include intermediates based on oxo
        and
        acetyl chemistries, and performance and custom-manufactured chemicals. PCI
        segment's 2005 sales revenue was approximately 55 percent olefin-based, 15
        percent acetyl-based, 10 percent polymer-based, and 20 percent based on
        performance and custom chemicals and other. Approximately 75 percent of PCI's
        sales revenue is generated in North America. Sales in all regions are generated
        through a mix of the Company’s direct sales force and a network of distributors.
        The Company's PCI segment is the largest marketer of acetic anhydride in
        the
        United States, an intermediate that is a critical component of analgesics
        and
        other pharmaceutical and agricultural products, and is the only U.S. producer
        of
        acetaldehyde, a key intermediate in the production of vitamins and other
        specialty products. Eastman manufactures one of the broadest ranges of oxo
        aldehyde derivatives products in the world. The PCI segment’s other intermediate
        products include plasticizers, glycols, and polymer intermediates. Many of
        the
        intermediate products in the PCI segment are priced based on supply and demand
        of substitute and competing products. In order to maintain a competitive
        position, the Company strives to operate with a low cost manufacturing base.


PCI
        also
        manufactures complex organic molecules such as diketene derivatives, specialty
        ketones, and specialty anhydrides for fiber and food and beverage ingredients,
        which are typically used in specialty market applications. PCI also engages
        in
        custom manufacturing where business is developed on a customer-by-customer
        basis. These specialty and custom manufacturing products are typically priced
        based on the amount of value added rather than supply and demand factors.
        PCI
        produces nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate bleach activator ("NOBS") for a key
        customer.

·

Strategy

To
        build
        on and maintain its status as a low cost producer, PCI continuously focuses
        on
        cost control, operational efficiency, and capacity utilization to maximize
        earnings. Through the PCI segment, the Company maximizes the advantage of
        its
        highly integrated and world-scale manufacturing facilities.

For
        example, the Kingsport, Tennessee manufacturing facilities allow the PCI
        segment
        to produce acetic anhydride and other acetyl derivatives from coal rather
        than
        natural gas or other petroleum feedstocks. Similarly, at the Longview, Texas
        facility, the PCI segment utilizes propane and local ethane supplies along
        with
        Eastman's proprietary oxo-technology in the world’s largest single-site, oxo
        aldehyde manufacturing facility to produce a wide range of alcohols, esters,
        and
        other derivative products. These integrated facilities, combined with large
        scale production processes and a continuous focus on additional process
        improvements, allow the PCI segment to remain cost competitive with, and
        for
        some products cost-advantaged over, its competitors. A recent example of
        Eastman’s continuous pursuit of cost and productivity improvement is the
        implementation of a successful cost reduction program within the acetyl
        production operations at the Kingsport site. Benefits from this effort allow
        the
        PCI segment to take advantage of the Company's strategic position within
        acetyl
        and related derivative markets.

The
        PCI
        segment selectively focuses on continuing to develop and access markets with
        high-growth potential for the Company’s chemicals. The Company engages in
        customer focused research and development initiatives in order to develop
        new
        products and find additional applications for existing products. In the future,
        the Company expects to capitalize on such applications in the personal care
        and
        specialty solvents markets.

The
        Company continues to evaluate the various businesses and product lines within
        the PCI segment, which could result in restructuring, divestiture, or
        consolidation to improve profitability.

·

Customers
                  and Markets

The
        PCI
        segment’s products are used in a variety of markets and end uses, including
        agrochemical, automotive, beverages, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, coatings,
        flooring, medical devices, toys, photographic and imaging, household products,
        polymers, textiles, and industrials. The markets for products with market-based
        pricing in the PCI segment are cyclical. This cyclicality is caused by periods
        of supply and demand imbalance, either when incremental capacity additions
        are
        not offset by corresponding increases in demand, or when demand exceeds existing
        supply. Demand, in turn, is based on general economic conditions, raw material
        and energy prices, consumer demand and other factors beyond the Company’s
        control. Eastman may be unable to increase or maintain its level of PCI sales
        in
        periods of economic stagnation or downturn, and future PCI results may fluctuate
        from period to period due to these economic conditions. The Company believes
        many of these markets are being positively affected by the current olefins
        upcycle. However, product-specific olefin derivative markets display a range
        of
        strength based upon prevailing supply/demand conditions.

An
        important trend within PCI's markets is a tendency toward increased
        regionalization of key markets, especially acetyls and olefins, due to increased
        transportation costs. During 2005, the PCI segment entered into a long-term
        arrangement with a Middle-Eastern company that will allow Eastman to leverage
        its proprietary acetyl technology to obtain access to acetyl chemicals produced
        in the Middle East region. Additionally, the PCI segment is engaged in
        continuous efforts directed toward optimizing product and customer mix.
        Approximately 80 percent of the PCI segment’s sales revenue in 2005 was
        associated with 90 out of approximately 1,250 customers worldwide.


·

Competition

Historically,
        there have been significant barriers to entry for competitors with respect
        to a
        majority of PCI's products, primarily due to the fact that the relevant
        technology has been held by a small number of companies. As this technology
        has
        become more readily available, competition from multinational chemical
        manufacturers has intensified. Eastman competes with these and other producers
        primarily based on price, as products are interchangeable, and, to a lesser
        extent, based on technology, marketing and other resources. Eastman’s major
        competitors in this segment include large multinational companies such as
        Dow,
        Celanese Corporation, BASF, and Exxon Mobil Corporation. While some of the
        Company’s competitors within the PCI segment have greater financial resources
        than Eastman, which may better enable them to compete on price, the Company
        believes it maintains a strong position due to the combination of its scale
        of
        operations, breadth of product line, level of integration, and technology
        leadership.

SP
        SEGMENT

·

Overview

The
        SP
        segment produces highly specialized copolyesters and cellulosic plastics
        that
        possess unique performance properties for value-added end uses such as
        appliances, store fixtures and displays, building and construction, electronic
        packaging, medical devices and packaging, personal care and cosmetics packaging,
        food and beverage packaging, performance films, tape and labels,
        fibers/nonwovens, photographic and optical film, graphic arts and general
        packaging. In 2005, the SP segment had sales revenue of $718 million, which
        represented approximately 10 percent of Eastman’s total sales and 20 percent of
        Eastman Division’s total sales.

The
        SP
        segment competes in the market for plastics that meet specific performance
        criteria, typically determined on an application-by-application basis. Product
        development in the specialty plastics segment is dependent upon Eastman’s
        ability to design plastics products that achieve performance characteristics
        specified by its customers, while providing a better value proposition than
        alternative materials such as polycarbonate and acrylic. Increases in market
        share are gained through the development of new applications, substitution
        of
        plastic for other materials, and particularly, displacement of other plastic
        resins in existing applications. The SP segment produces polyesters, specialty
        copolyesters, plastic sheeting, cellulose esters, and cellulosic plastics.
        The
        Company estimates that the market growth for copolyesters, which has
        historically been high due to the relatively small market size, will continue
        to
        be higher than general economic growth due to displacement opportunities.
        Eastman believes that the cellulosic plastics markets growth will be flat
        or, at
        best, equal to the rate of growth of the economy in general.

Eastman’s
        specialty copolyesters, which generally are based on Eastman's market leading
        supply of cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM") modified polymers, typically fill
        a
        market position between polycarbonates and acrylics. Polycarbonates
        traditionally have had some superior performance characteristics, while acrylics
        have been less expensive. Specialty copolyesters combine superior performance
        with competitive pricing and are being substituted for both polycarbonates
        and
        acrylics based on their relative performance and pricing.

The
        SP
        segment also includes cellulosic plastics, which has historically been a
        steady
        business with strong operating margins for the Company, and includes what
        Eastman believes is a market-leading position in North American cellulose
        esters
        for tape and film products and cellulose plastics for molding
        applications.

Eastman
        has the ability within its SP segment to modify its polymers and plastics
        to
        control and customize their final properties, creating numerous opportunities
        for new application development, including the expertise to develop new
        materials and new applications starting from the molecular level in the research
        laboratory to the final designed application in the customer’s plant. In
        addition, the SP segment has a long history of manufacturing excellence with
        strong process improvement programs providing continuing cost reduction.
        Manufacturing process models and information technology systems support global
        manufacturing sites and provide monitoring and information transfer capability
        that speed up the innovation process.

Products

The
        SP
        segment’s key products are:

Ø

Engineering
                  and Specialty Polymers

Engineering
        and specialty polymers accounted for approximately 50 percent of the SP
        segment’s 2005 sales revenue. These polymers include a broad line of polyesters,
        copolyesters, alloys, cellulose flake, and cellulosic plastics that are sold
        to
        a diverse and highly fragmented customer base in numerous market segments
        on a
        global basis. Approximately 45 percent of the revenues from engineering and
        specialty polymers are generated in North America. Sales in all regions are
        generated through a mix of the Company’s direct sales force and a network of
        distributors. Engineering and specialty polymers products are sold into three
        sectors: durable goods (principally components used in appliances); medical
        goods (disposable medical devices, health care equipment and instruments,
        and
        pharmaceutical packaging); and personal care and consumer goods (housewares,
        cosmetics, eyewear, tools, toys, food and beverage packaging).

Engineering
        and specialty polymers products are heavily specification-driven. The Company
        works with OEM companies to enable product designers to use polymers for
        a
        specified use in their products. Although the average life cycle of many
        of
        these products is shrinking over time, the Company works to identify uses
        for
        the polymers in products that will have multi-year lives. In working with
        OEM
        companies on new consumer product designs, new polymer products are often
        developed for use in a particular type of end-use product.

Ø

Specialty
                  Film and Sheet

Approximately
        30 percent of the SP segment’s 2005 revenue resulted from sales of specialty
        film and sheet products. The key end-use markets for specialty film and sheet
        are packaging, in-store fixtures and displays, and building and construction.
        Direct customers are film and sheet producers, but marketing activities focus
        downstream through designers, specifiers, OEMs and brand owners in targeted
        end-use markets.

In
        the
        packaging market, specialty film and sheet is sold to end-use markets including
        medical and electronic component trays, shrink label films, general purpose
        packaging, and multilayer films. Copolyester use in these markets is relatively
        mature with the exception of shrink label films. Competitive materials in
        these
        end-use markets are typically PET polymers, acrylics, polyvinyl chloride
        (“PVC”)
        and oriented polystyrene. Eastman’s primary brands for these markets are

Eastar

and

Embrace

copolyesters.

In
        the
        display market,

Spectar

copolyester is marketed primarily for point of purchase displays including
        indoor sign and store fixtures.

Eastar

copolyester is marketed into the graphics market. Copolyester use in these
        end-use markets is expected to grow above display market rates as a result
        of
        new business growth. Competitive materials in these end-use markets are
        polymethylmethacrylate (“PMMA”) and polycarbonate.

The
        building and construction end-use market continues to be a focus for growth
        in
        specialty film and sheet. The Company is seeking a number of new opportunities
        within this market. The use of copolyester in this market is expected to
        grow
        significantly above building and construction market rates due to current
        low
        penetration of copolyester into targeted segments. Competitive materials
        for
        building and construction are typically PMMA, polycarbonate, and
        glass.


Ø

Packaging,
                  Film and Fiber

Packaging,
        film and fiber products, which represented approximately 20 percent of the
        SP
        segment’s 2005 revenue, include a range of specialty polymer products for
        markets such as photographic film, optical film, fibers/nonwovens, and
        tapes/labels uses. Customers are typically manufacturers of film and fiber
        products, employing a range of processing technologies, including film melt
        extrusion, solvent casting, and fiber extrusion. These films and fibers products
        are further converted to produce value-added products, such as photographic
        film, adhesive tape or nonwoven articles, which are sold as branded items.
        Products include cellulose esters, copolyesters, specialty polyesters and
        concentrates/additives. Sales of products that are used as raw materials
        in
        traditional photographic markets continue to be under pressure due to the
        conversion of traditional photographic technology to digital imaging. SP
        has
        work underway in the liquid crystal displays market to offset the impact
        of this
        conversion.

·

Strategy

The
        SP
        segment is focused on delivering consistent gross margins and reinvesting
        for
        consistent growth. Over the past two years, the SP segment has divested certain
        non-core businesses, shut-down certain non-integrated manufacturing operations,
        and expanded certain integrated facilities. The Company continues to leverage
        the advantages of being an integrated polyester manufacturer and will continue
        to pursue opportunities within the integrated polyester stream. One such
        opportunity is scaled differentiation, which is the potential for SP to utilize
        rationalized PET assets to reduce copolyester conversion costs and enhance
        its
        ability to market its products against competitive materials. This opportunity
        is expected to capture the synergies of the Polymers segment's advantaged
        cost
        structure and SP segment's ability to develop higher value markets. These
        synergies should enable SP to reduce costs and expand production, increase
        the
        scale necessary to substitute for competitive materials, and focus on targeted
        growth markets. The SP segment continues to pursue growth by investing in
        marketing, research and development, and manufacturing to meet the needs
        of the
        global marketplace. For example, the segment is completing a capital project
        to
        increase copolyester intermediates capacity in order to meet expected growth
        in
        global demand.

Eastman
        has a broad portfolio of key monomers that can be combined in various ways
        to
        yield a range of polymers with widely varying properties for different
        applications. Development of proprietary technology is currently underway
        to
        enable the SP segment to produce a new family of products that would allow
        entry
        into applications that have been beyond the reach of the current portfolio
        of
        copolyester products. This new technology is expected to offer a combination
        of
        chemical and temperature resistance that should lend itself to a number of
        new
        applications where these properties are important.

The
        Company competes in market niches requiring polymers with combinations of
        clarity, toughness, and chemical resistance. The liquid crystal display market
        is a new focus of growth for SP. SP segment is investing in the development
        of
        copolyester and cellulosic-plastic based product solutions for this high-growth
        market, with the objective of becoming a strategic raw material supplier
        for
        liquid crystal display.

The
        SP
        segment develops product enhancements in order to respond to specific market
        needs, and expects this to result in increased market penetration for existing
        products. Likewise, the introduction of new products will provide access
        to
        previously underserved markets. In addition, the SP segment is focusing on
        global growth by investing resources to provide product solutions to customers
        in previously underserved regional markets. The SP model of innovation leverages
        a unique and growing portfolio of cellulosics and specialty copolyesters,
        such
        as

Cadence

,
        a
        copolyester for calendared film applications,

Embrace

copolyester for shrink films, and

Eastar

and

Durastar

copolyesters for cosmetic and household applications.

The
        Company is a major supplier of resins to the specialty film and sheet markets.
        With less than 10 percent of the global specialty film and sheet end-use
        markets, substantial growth opportunities exist for Eastman. The growth strategy
        is to penetrate new market segments or geographies and offer a substitute
        for
        other materials by providing an improved value proposal or design flexibility
        that enhances the growth potential of the Company’s customers.

Customers
                  and Markets

The
        customer base in the SP segment is broad and diverse, consisting of over
        companies worldwide in a variety of industries. Approximately 80 percent
        of the
        SP segment’s 2005 revenue was attributable to approximately 70 customers. The SP
        segment seeks to develop mutually beneficial relationships with its customers
        throughout various stages of product life cycles. By doing so, it is better
        able
        to understand its customers’ needs as those customers develop new products, and
        more effectively bring new solutions to market.

·

Competition

Competition
        in the SP segment varies as a function of where the products are in their
        life
        cycle. For example, the SP segment's products in the introduction phase of
        the
        life cycle compete mainly on the basis of performance. As products begin
        to
        advance in the life cycle, and substitute products come into existence, the
        basis of competition begins to shift, taking into account factors such as
        price,
        customer service, and brand loyalty. At maturity, where one or more competitors
        may have equivalent products in the market, competition is based primarily
        on
        price. Many large, well-recognized manufacturers produce substitute products
        of
        different materials, some of which may offer better performance characteristics
        than those of the Company's products, and others of which may be offered
        at a
        lower price.

The
        SP
        segment has a full array of products moving across the life cycle as described
        above. For example, two commonly used plastics materials in the heavy gauge
        sheet market are acrylic and polycarbonate. In general, acrylics are lower
        in
        cost, while polycarbonates provide higher performance at a higher cost.
        Eastman’s products capture portions of both markets. Customers of the SP segment
        can select from products that offer improved performance over acrylics at
        a
        slightly higher cost, or products that are lower cost than polycarbonates
        while
        still possessing excellent performance properties. In this way, the SP segment
        is able to meet the industry need for low-cost, high performance plastics
        materials and maintain a significant advantage over its competitors. With
        regard
        to engineering and specialty polymers products, the Company competes in market
        areas requiring polymers with combinations of clarity, toughness, and chemical
        resistance. Eastman’s primary competitors for engineering and specialty polymers
        are companies such as Bayer AG, Lanxess, Dow, GE Plastics, Nova and others,
        including polycarbonate, acrylic and clear acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
        producers in regions outside North America. Specialty film and sheet competitors
        also include polymer companies, such as GE Plastics, Bayer AG, Dow, Cyro,
        Ineos,
        Atoglas, SK Chemical Industries, and Selenis, which sell copolyesters,
        polycarbonate, acrylic, and/or polyvinyl chloride resins. Competition for
        packaging, film and fiber products is primarily from other producers of
        polyester and producers of cellulose ester polymers such as Acetati SpA and
        Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd. Competition with other polymers such as
        acrylic, PVC, polystyrene, polypropylene and polycarbonate is also significant
        in several markets and applications. Channels to customers include corporate
        accounts, direct sales, e-commerce, and distributors.

SP
        believes that it maintains competitive advantages over its competitors in
        the SP
        segment throughout the product life cycle. At product introduction, the
        segment’s breadth of offerings combined with its research and development
        capabilities and customer service orientation enable it to quickly bring
        a wide
        variety of products to market. As products enter the growth phase of the
        life
        cycle, SP is able to continue to leverage its product breadth by receiving
        revenues from multiple sources, as well as retaining customers from long-term
        relationships. As products become price sensitive, SP can take advantage
        of
        Eastman's scale of operations and vertical integration to maintain superior
        product conversion cost position.

SP
        believes it has competitive advantages in copolyester and cellulose ester
        plastics. However, new competitors have begun selling copolyester products
        in
        the past few years. These new competitors cannot yet produce the wide variety
        of
        specialty copolyesters offered by SP or offer the same level of technical
        assistance. Additionally, SP is committed to increasing the utilization of
        current capacity and maintaining the cost advantages obtained from its scale
        of
        operations and manufacturing expertise. There can be no assurance, however,
        that
        the SP segment will be able to maintain this competitive advantage and if
        it is
        unable to do so, its results of operations could be adversely affected.

Eastman
        Division’s products are marketed through a variety of selling channels, with the
        majority of sales being direct and the balance sold primarily through indirect
        channels such as distributors. Non-U.S. sales tend to be made more frequently
        through distributors than U.S. sales. Eastman Division's customers throughout
        the world have the choice of obtaining products and services through Eastman's
        website,

www.eastman.com

,
        through
        any of its global customer service centers, or through any of Eastman's direct
        sales force or independent distributors. Customers who choose to use the
        Company’s website can conduct a wide range of business transactions such as
        ordering online, accessing account and order status, and obtaining product
        and
        technical data. Eastman is an industry leader in the implementation and
        utilization of e-business technology for marketing and selling products to
        customers and was one of the first chemical companies to offer this capability.
        Eastman views this as an opportunity to increase supply chain efficiency
        by
        having an enterprise resource-planning platform with connectivity to customers.
        These sales and marketing capabilities combine to reduce costs and provide
        a
        platform for growth opportunities for the Company by providing potential
        customers new methods to access Eastman’s products.

Eastman
        Division’s products are shipped to customers directly from Eastman's
        manufacturing plants as well as from distribution centers worldwide, with
        the
        method of shipment generally determined by the customer.

Intellectual
        Property and Trademarks

The
        Company considers its Eastman Division-related intellectual property portfolio
        to be a valuable corporate asset which it expands and vigorously protects
        globally through a combination of patents that expire at various times,
        trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. The Company’s primary strategy
        regarding its Eastman Division-related intellectual property portfolio is
        to
        protect all innovations that provide its segments with a significant competitive
        advantage. The Company also derives value from its intellectual property
        by
        licensing and selling patents and expertise worldwide. In addition, when
        appropriate, the Company licenses technology from third parties that complements
        Eastman Division’s strategic business objectives. Neither Eastman Division’s
        business as a whole nor any particular segment is materially dependent upon
        any
        one particular patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret. As a producer
        of a
        broad and diverse portfolio of chemicals and plastics, Eastman Division’s
        intellectual property and trademarks relate to a wide variety of products
        and
        processes. As the laws of many foreign countries do not protect intellectual
        property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, Eastman Division
        cannot assure that it will be able to adequately protect all of its intellectual
        property assets.

Research
        and Development

Eastman
        Division devotes significant resources to its research and development programs,
        which are primarily targeted towards two objectives:

·

developing
                  new products, processes, and markets through applications research;

VORIDIAN
        DIVISION

Business
        and Industry Overview

The
        Voridian Division consists of the Polymers segment and the Fibers segment.
        The
        Polymers segment contains two principal product lines, PET and polyethylene
        (“PE”). The PET product line is large, global in scope and has the largest
        capacity share of all competitors in the polyesters for packaging industry.
        The
        PE product line is primarily North American in scope and has a relatively
        small
        market share. The Fibers segment is made up of acetate tow, acetate yarn,
        and
        acetyl chemical products. Voridian is one of the two largest worldwide producers
        of acetate tow and the largest producer of acetate yarn. Globally positioned
        to
        serve its growing markets, Voridian has eight manufacturing plants in six
        countries, as well as access to PET production through two contract
        manufacturing arrangements in Asia that are currently inactive.

Strategy

Voridian
        Division participates in price sensitive markets where product performance
        is a
        requirement for involvement and low cost is the primary driver for success.
        As a
        result, the division’s strategic goals focus on maintaining quality products,
        operational excellence, and its global position as an efficient producer
        of
        polymers and fibers. The key elements of this strategy include:

·

Operational
                  Efficiency

Voridian
        Division is a global leader in market share in two of its major product markets
        and expects to continue to leverage its product knowledge, experience, and
        scale
        to further reduce production costs and increase output. Because the Company
        is a
        highly integrated major PET producer and one of only a few integrated acetate
        fiber producers, Voridian intends to develop further efficiencies to enhance
        its
        cost position.

·

Capital
                  Efficiency

Voridian
        Division seeks to expand its production capabilities in a capital-efficient
        manner. Efforts will include: maximizing capacity utilization at existing
        manufacturing facilities; reducing bottlenecks at those facilities; asset
        expansions utilizing

IntegRex

technologies, which are expected to allow greater production in less space;
        and
        smart growth through participation in strategic manufacturing alliances and
        contract manufacturing or toll arrangements.

·

Superior
                  Process Technology

Voridian
        Division has a demonstrated expertise in developing and implementing improved
        process technologies. Through efficient use of research and development,
        Voridian intends to continue that trend and to develop increasingly efficient
        technologies with the goal of lowering manufacturing costs and improving
        operating margins. In March 2005, the Company began construction in Columbia,
        South Carolina of the first manufacturing facility utilizing

IntegRex

technology,

a
        breakthrough technology for the manufacture of PET resin. This technology
        is
        expected to enhance the cost position and overall efficiency of the

PET

manufacturing
        process, allowing Voridian to meet future market demand with the most advanced
        manufacturing facilities in the world.


·

Quality
                  and Innovation

Voridian
        Division’s product quality and innovation make it a recognized industry leader
        in the markets in which it participates. Through the efficient use of research
        and development, Voridian expects to continue to develop and commercialize
        new
        products and processes where customer needs and consumer preference offer
        improved returns or increased market share.

POLYMERS
        SEGMENT

·

Overview

In
        2005,
        the Polymers segment had revenues of $2.5 billion, which represented 36 percent
        of the Company’s total sales and 74 percent of Voridian’s total sales. The
        segment consists of two principal product lines, PET and PE.

Both
        the
        PET and PE product lines compete to a large degree on price. Both can also
        be
        characterized as capital intensive. Success in each is impacted by attaining
        low
        cost positions through technology innovation, manufacturing scale, capacity
        utilization, access to reliable and competitive utilities, energy and raw
        materials, efficient manufacturing processes and efficient
        distribution.

PET
        production is vertically integrated back to the raw material paraxylene for
        a
        substantial majority of its capacity. The Polymers segment's PET product
        line
        for the packaging market is the world’s largest based on capacity share; is the
        most global based on manufacturing sites; and is the broadest based on formula
        diversity. PET is used in a wide variety of packaging products including
        for
        carbonated soft drinks, water, juice, personal care items, household cleaners,
        beer and food containers. The Polymers segment has PET manufacturing sites
        in
        the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Great Britain, Spain, and the Netherlands.
        In addition, the Polymers segment has access to PET production through contract
        manufacturing arrangements at two sites in Asia. The Polymers segment competes
        primarily in North America, Latin America, and Europe. The PE product lines
        are
        manufactured entirely in the United States and have a relatively small market
        share.

Products

Ø

PET

PET
        is
        used in beverage and food packaging and other applications such as custom-care
        and cosmetics packaging, health care and pharmaceutical uses, household products
        and industrial packaging applications. PET offers fast and easy processing,
        and
        the packaging characteristics are: superb clarity, excellent colorability
        and
        color consistency, durability and strength, impact and chemical resistance,
        and
        high heat stability. Packages made from PET are characterized by their light
        weight, high strength, durability, clarity, low cost, safety, and recyclability.
        PET accounted for 80 percent of the revenue in the Polymers segment.

Ø

PE

The
        Polymers segment also offers a PE product line manufactured in the United
        States
        including low density polyethylene ("LDPE") and linear low density polyethylene
        (“LLDPE”). The LLDPE products are produced using the Company’s proprietary

Energx

manufacturing technology for gas-phase polyethylene production. Polymers'
        PE
        products are used primarily for extrusion coating, film, and molding
        applications. The LDPE and LLDPE product lines accounted for approximately
        percent of the Polymers segment’s sales revenue in 2005.

·

Strategy

Ø

Growth

The
        Polymers segment intends to capitalize on the growth in the PET industry
        with
        timely and efficient capacity additions including debottlenecking existing
        production processes, asset expansions, new assets, contract-manufacturing
        arrangements, and manufacturing alliances. This growth strategy will rely
        on
        continuous process technology improvements from the efficient use of research
        and development, as well as the rationalization of smaller scale PET assets,
        which could be redirected to manufacturing copolyester
        products.


Capitalizing
        on the Company’s new

IntegRex

technology, in March 2005 the Company began construction of a new
        350-thousand-metric-ton expansion at its PET polymers site in Columbia, South
        Carolina. The new facility is expected to be fully operational in the fourth
        quarter of 2006 and at full capacity in time for the peak 2007 demand season.
        Because this new facility is expected to have the lowest cost of manufacturing
        of all North American PET producers, volume growth from this facility is
        not
        expected to be impacted by Asian PET polymer imports into the region. The
        Company is also evaluating an option for another

IntegRex

facility
        in North America.

Ø

Innovation

The
        Polymers segment expects to continue to provide customers with innovative
        new
        products and incremental improvements in existing products. Voridian currently
        maintains the industry’s broadest product offering for PET polymers including:
        Voridian

Aqua

polymer
        for the water bottle market,

Heatwave

polymer
        for hotfill markets,

Versatray

polymer
        for the dual ovenable tray market and

Vitiva

polymer
        for ultraviolet light sensitive applications.

·

Customers
                  and Markets

The
        largest 54 customers within the Polymers segment accounted for more than
        percent of the segment’s total sales revenue in 2005. These customers are
        primarily PET container suppliers to large volume beverage markets such as
        carbonated soft drinks, water, and juice, with strong participation in custom
        areas such as food, liquor, sport and fruit beverages, health and beauty
        aids,
        and household products. In 2005, the worldwide market for PET, including
        containers, film and sheet, was approximately 11 million metric tons. Demand
        for
        PET has grown briskly over the past several years, driven by its popularity
        as a
        substitute for glass and aluminum. PET has already made significant inroads
        in
        soft drink and water bottles, and producers are currently targeting markets
        such
        as hot-fill soups and sauces and containers for beer. Industry analysts report
        that PET consumption grew worldwide from 1.0 million metric tons in 1989
        to
        approximately 11 million metric tons in 2005, a compound annual growth rate
        of
        15 percent. Global demand for PET is expected to grow approximately 6-8 percent
        annually over the next several years.

In
        the
        LDPE product line, Voridian is a significant producer of materials used in
        extrusion coating applications and is one of only two North American producers
        of acrylate copolymers. In the LLDPE market, Voridian employs its proprietary

Energx

technology to produce products that compete in higher strength film and
        packaging markets.

·

Competition

Major
        competitors for the Polymers segment include DAK Americas, Equipolymers,
        Far
        Eastern Textiles Ltd., Invista, M&G, Nan Ya Plastics Corporation, Reliance
        Industries Ltd., Wellman Inc., Dow Chemical Company, ExxonMobil Corporation,
        Equistar Chemical Company, Nova Chemicals Corporation, Westlake Chemical
        Corporation, and Huntsman Corporation.

Ø

PET

The
        strong growth in demand for PET, coupled with ease of access to conventional
        manufacturing technology, has resulted in the presence of over 100 significant
        resin producers in this market in 2005, up from fewer than 20 in 1995. The
        Polymers segment is a global competitor with manufacturing sites in North
        America, Latin America and Western Europe, as well as the aforementioned
        contract manufacturing arrangements in Asia. The level of competition, however,
        varies by region. Competition is primarily on the basis of price with product
        performance, quality, service, and reliability also being requirements for
        participation.

Industry
        pricing is strongly affected by raw material costs and capacity utilization.
        PET
        global supply has exceeded demand since 1997 as a result of capacity being
        introduced into the market at a rate exceeding that of demand growth. While
        the
        demand for PET continues to increase steadily, excess capacity, primarily
        in
        Asia, remains. Excess Asian capacity is expected to continue to have an adverse
        impact on PET pricing worldwide.


Ø

PE

The
        Polymers segment is a niche polyethylene producer due to its size and ability
        to
        target specific markets. Competitive advantage in these markets is achieved
        through operating efficiencies and new product offerings. Some polyethylene
        producers are substantially larger than the Polymers segment, and have greater
        market presence and resources devoted to polyethylene. This may allow them,
        or
        other competitors, to price competing products at lower levels, or devote
        substantial resources to product development.

        The Fibers segment is one of the world’s two largest suppliers of acetate tow
        and has been a market leader in the manufacture and sale of acetate tow since
        it
        began producing the product in the early 1950s. The Fibers segment is the
        world’s largest producer of acetate yarn. In 2005, the Fibers segment had sales
        revenue of approximately $869 million, which represented 12 percent of the
        Company’s total sales and 26 percent of Voridian’s total sales.

The
        Fibers segment’s long history and experience in the fibers markets are reflected
        in its operating expertise, both within the Company and in support of its
        customers’ processes. The Fibers segment’s expertise in internal operating
        processes allows it to achieve a consistently high level of product quality,
        a
        differentiating factor in the industry. Further, the segment’s fully integrated
        facilities from coal-based acetyl raw materials through acetate tow and yarn
        allow a reduction in dependence on petrochemicals from third parties. Also,
        the
        Fibers segment employs the only continuous flake manufacturing process that
        can
        use multiple sources of pulp as raw material. As a result, the segment has
        qualified all major, high purity, pulp suppliers that make pulp suitable
        for
        acetate fibers. The Fibers segment is confident that it has one of the most
        secure pulp supply positions despite the continuing consolidation of the
        pulp
        industry. The Fibers' segment management believes that all of these factors
        combine to make it a leader in performance, reliability of supply, and cost
        position.

The
        Fibers segment's high-quality products, technical expertise, and superior
        customer service are its key competitive strengths. The Fibers segment’s
        industry knowledge and knowledge of customers’ processes allow it to assist its
        customers in maximizing their processing efficiencies, promoting repeat sales
        and mutually beneficial, long-term customer relationships. The segment’s scale,
        strong customer base, long-standing customer relationships, and expert technical
        service contribute to its market-leading position. The Fibers segment's goal
        is
        to build on these strengths to improve its strategic position.

Strategy

Voridian’s
        strategy in the Fibers segment is as follows:

Ø

Position
                  for Growth

In
        the
        Fibers segment, Voridian focuses on high quality products, excellent customer
        service, operational efficiencies, and potential alliances to take advantage
        of
        global market growth.

The
        Company is considering the expansion of its acetate tow capacity in Europe
        with
        a target date of 2008. The expansion site would be located in a European
        Union
        ("EU") country to better serve existing customers in Western Europe and the
        growing demand from Eastern Europe. Due to the recent addition of 10 countries,
        the EU now includes many member countries in Eastern Europe where the demand
        for
        filter tow is growing. The acetate flake raw material for the capacity expansion
        would be sourced from existing flake capacity in Kingsport, Tennessee.

The
        Company is also considering the construction of a new 25-30 KMT per year
        acetate
        tow plant in Asia, a major growth region, with a target date of 2009. This
        capacity would be approximately 5 percent of current global capacity and
        would
        be expected to be rapidly utilized due to its location in a major growth
        region.
        The Company would likely supply acetate flake raw material for this expansion
        from its Kingsport site.

The
        Fibers segment is increasing acetate yarn capacity by approximately 5 percent
        with this expansion to be on-stream by mid 2006.

Ø

        to focus on refining its processes to lower manufacturing costs and provide
        additional product quality and operations improvements.

Ø

Maintain
                  Cost-Effective Operations and Consistent Cash
                  Flows

The
        Fibers segment expects to continue to operate in a cost effective manner,
        capitalizing on its scale and vertical integration, and intends to make further
        productivity and efficiency improvements through continued investments in
        research and development. The Company plans to reinvest in the Fibers business
        to continue to improve product performance and productivity in order to generate
        consistently strong earnings and cash flows.

·

Customers
                  and Markets

The
        customer base in the Fibers segment is relatively concentrated, consisting
        of
        approximately 190 companies, primarily those involved in the production of
        cigarettes and in the textiles industry. The largest 20 customers within
        the
        Fibers segment include multinational as well as regional cigarette producers,
        textile industry fabric manufacturers and acetate fiber producers. These
        largest
        customers accounted for greater than 80 percent of the segment’s total sales
        revenue in 2005.

The
        Fibers segment engages in collaborative planning with its customers to maximize
        supply chain management. These customer-focused efforts, combined with Fibers'
        long history and product quality reputation, have resulted in many long-term
        customer relationships, a key competitive advantage.

The
        Fibers segment is well known for its expert technical service, which provides
        its customers with regular reviews of their processes and provides process
        training to some of its customers' employees to assist them in the efficient

Competition

Competitors
        in the fibers market for acetate tow include one global competitor, Celanese
        Corporation; three multi-regional competitors; and two regional companies.
        For
        acetate yarn, major competitors include two companies that target multi-regional
        markets and several regional players.

In
        the
        acetate tow market, two major competitors have joint venture capacity in
        China,
        and one of these competitors completed an expansion of its joint venture
        facilities in 2005. Another competitor has announced plans for expanding
        capacity to be completed in 2006. Increased local production in China may
        diminish access to this market by Eastman and other competitors over time.
        However, current global capacity utilization rates are expected to remain
        high
        given the world-wide growth rate in demand and the industry structure changes
        that occurred in 2005 when a major competitor closed a North American acetate
        tow production facility.

In
        2005,
        a major competitor exited the acetate filament yarn market. As a direct result,
        the Company became the world leader in acetate yarn production, the only
        acetate
        yarn producer vertically integrated in acetate flake production, and the
        only
        acetate yarn producer in North America. The yarn market tightened significantly
        as the competitor's yarn inventory was consumed in the world marketplace,
        and
        world prices for acetate yarn increased to profitable levels during late
        2005.
        The Fibers segment is well positioned to serve this market due to an in depth
        knowledge of end use markets; careful selection of a balanced portfolio of
        markets, customers, and products; and a highly integrated, large scale
        manufacturing operation.

VORIDIAN
        DIVISION GENERAL INFORMATION

Sales,
        Marketing and Distribution

Voridian

        integrated direct capabilities to customers, allowing enhanced collaborative
        planning to improve supply chain efficiencies.

Intellectual
        Property and Trademarks

The
        Company believes that significant advantages can be obtained through its
        continued focus on branding its products and, for this reason, considers
        its
        Voridian Division-related intellectual property portfolio to be a valuable
        corporate asset which it expands and vigorously protects globally through
        a
        combination of patents that expire at various times, trademarks, licenses,
        copyrights, and trade secrets. The Company expects to expand its portfolio
        of
        technologies licensed to other companies in the future. To date, the Company
        has
        selectively licensed a limited portfolio of patented polyester intermediates
        and
        polyethylene technologies. Voridian Division’s intellectual property portfolio
        is an important asset. However, neither its business as a whole nor any
        particular segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent,
        trademark, copyright, or trade secret. As the laws of many foreign countries
        do
        not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United
        States, Voridian Division cannot assure that it will be able to adequately
        protect its intellectual property assets.

        of significant, concentrated research and development efforts resulted in
        the
        announcement of

IntegRex

technology, a breakthrough innovation in the integrated manufacturing of
        paraxylene to PET resin, specifically designed for packaging applications.
        In
        2005, research and development efforts further enhanced

IntegRex

technology in parallel with commencement of construction of the first

IntegRex

manufacturing facility in Columbia, South Carolina. In September 2005, the
        Company announced it was evaluating a second world-class facility in North
        America utilizing these further refinements to

IntegRex

technology.

Ø

                  Segment

Research
        and development efforts for the Fibers segment are primarily focused on
        incremental process and product improvements, as well as cost reduction,
        with
        the objectives of increasing sales and reducing costs. Recent achievements
        have
        included fiber product advancements that allow improved processability on
        customers’ equipment and improved packaging design. The Fibers segment also
        engages in research to assist acetate tow customers in the cigarette industry
        in
        the effective use of Voridian products and in the customers’ own filter product
        development efforts.

DEVELOPING
        BUSINESSES DIVISION

Developing
        Businesses Segment

The
        DB
        segment includes new businesses that leverage the Company’s technology
        expertise, intellectual property, and know-how into business models that
        extend
        to new customers and markets, and is an extension of the corporate research
        and
        development function. The DB segment expands on the Company’s core business of
        chemicals, plastics, and fibers manufacturing to develop growth platforms
        that
        allow it to take advantage of its technological capabilities and operational
        skills. It uses a disciplined stage gating process in evaluating projects
        to
        weigh expected returns against investment levels at various stages of
        development. Those that meet the initial requirements go on to the next stage
        where a cross-functional team of experts from marketing, technology, business,
        and finance determine if there is a compelling business plan and a viable
        means
        for capturing value from it.

The
        segment includes early stage businesses, including Eastman’s Gasification
        Services and Centrus Corporation ("Centrus"), a food safety diagnostics
        business, which was sold in February 2006. The business operations of the
        Company's logistics subsidiary, Cendian Corporation ("Cendian"), were
        discontinued during 2005, and the logistics services being performed for
        Eastman
        by Cendian were fully integrated back into Eastman in April 2005.


EASTMAN
        CHEMICAL COMPANY GENERAL INFORMATION

Sources
        and Availability of Raw Materials and Energy

Eastman
        purchases a substantial portion, estimated to be approximately 75 percent,
        of
        its key raw materials and energy through long-term contracts, generally of
        three
        to five years initial duration with renewal or cancellation options for each
        party. Most of those agreements do not require the Company to purchase materials
        or energy if its operations are reduced or idle. The cost of raw materials
        and
        energy is generally based on market price at the time of purchase, although
        derivative financial instruments, valued at quoted market prices, have been
        utilized to mitigate the impact of short-term market price fluctuations.
        Key raw
        materials and purchased energy include propane, ethane, paraxylene, ethylene
        glycol, PTA, natural gas, coal, cellulose, methanol, electricity, and a wide
        variety of precursors for specialty organic chemicals. The Company has multiple
        suppliers for most key raw materials and energy and uses quality management
        principles, such as the establishment of long-term relationships with suppliers
        and on-going performance assessment and benchmarking, as part of the supplier
        selection process. When appropriate, the Company purchases raw materials
        from a
        single source supplier to maximize quality and cost improvements, and has
        developed contingency plans that would minimize the impact of any supply
        disruptions from single source suppliers.

While
        temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur, these
        items are generally sufficiently available to cover current and projected
        requirements. However, their continuous availability and price are subject
        to
        unscheduled plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand,
        or due
        to domestic or world market and political conditions, changes in government
        regulation, natural disasters, war or other outbreak of hostilities. Eastman’s
        operations or products have in the past and may in the future, at times,
        be
        adversely affected by these factors. The Company’s cost of raw materials and
        energy as a percent of total cost of operations was estimated to be
        approximately 65 percent for 2005, compared with 55 percent in 2004 and 50
        percent in 2003.

Capital
        Expenditures

Capital
        expenditures were $343 million, $248 million, and $230 million for 2005,
        and 2003, respectively. The Company expects that 2006 capital spending will
        be
        up to $450 million which will exceed estimated 2006 depreciation and
        amortization of approximately $300 million as it funds targeted growth efforts.

Employees

Eastman
        employs approximately 12,000 men and women worldwide. Approximately 6 percent
        of
        the total worldwide labor force is represented by unions, mostly outside
        the
        United States.

Customers

Eastman
        has an extensive customer base and, while it is not dependent on any one
        customer, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the Company
        until
        such business is replaced. The top 100 customers accounted for approximately
        percent of the Company's 2005 sales revenue.

Intellectual
        Property and Trademarks

While
        the
        Company’s intellectual property portfolio is an important Company asset which it
        expands and vigorously protects globally through a combination of patents
        that
        expire at various times, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, neither
        its
        business as a whole nor any particular segment is materially dependent upon
        any
        one particular patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret. As a producer
        of a
        broad and diverse portfolio of both specialty and commodity chemicals, plastics,
        and fibers, Eastman owns over 900 active United States patents and more than
        active foreign patents, expiring at various times over several years, and
        also
        owns over 3,000 active worldwide trademarks. The Company’s intellectual property
        relates to a wide variety of products and processes. As the laws of many
        foreign
        countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the
        laws of
        the United States, Eastman cannot assure that it will be able to adequately
        protect its intellectual property assets.


Research
        and Development

For
        2005,
        2004 and 2003, Eastman’s research and development expenses totaled $162 million,
        $154 million and $173 million, respectively. Research and development expenses
        are expected to increase slightly in 2006 as the Company will continue to
        increase its technology efforts associated with new products and process
        technologies.

Environmental

Eastman
        is subject to laws, regulations, and legal requirements relating to the use,
        storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal
        and
        remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and
        wastes in all of the countries in which it does business. These health, safety
        and environmental considerations are a priority in the Company’s planning for
        all existing and new products and processes. The Health, Safety, Environmental
        and Security Committee of Eastman’s Board of Directors reviews the Company's
        policies and practices concerning health, safety and the environment and
        its
        processes for complying with related laws and regulations, and monitors related
        matters.

The
        Company’s policy is to operate its plants and facilities in a manner that
        protects the environment and the health and safety of its employees and the
        public. The Company intends to continue to make expenditures for environmental
        protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with its policies
        and
        with the technology available. In some cases, applicable environmental
        regulations such as those adopted under the U.S. Clean Air Act and Resource
        Conservation and Recovery Act, and related actions of regulatory agencies,
        determine the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by the
        Company.

The
        Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the Company
        has
        incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In some
        instances, the amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to insufficient
        data,
        particularly in the nature and timing of the future performance. In these
        cases,
        the liability is monitored until such time that sufficient data exists. With
        respect to a contaminated site, the amount accrued

reflects
        the Company’s assumptions about remedial requirements at the site, the nature of
        the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other
        potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and
        financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in
        the
        estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement
        action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control
        regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher or lower
        costs.

The
        Company's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement
        were estimated to be approximately $198 million, $184 million and $187 million
        in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts pertain primarily to
        operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and
        facilities, but also include expenditures for construction and development.
        The
        Company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising
        from
        requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to
        materially increase the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures
        for environmental control facilities.

Other
        matters pertaining to health, safety, and the environment are discussed in
        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations and Notes 1 and 12 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements
        in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Backlog

On
        January 1, 2006, Eastman’s backlog of firm sales orders was estimated to be
        approximately $295 million compared with approximately $306 million at January
        1, 2005.

All
        orders are expected to be filled in 2006. T

he Company manages its
        inventory levels to control the backlog of products depending on customers'
        needs. In areas where the Company is the single source of supply, or competitive
        forces or customers' needs dictate, the Company may carry additional inventory
        to meet customer requirements.

At
        December 31, 2005, Eastman operated 17 manufacturing sites in 10 countries.
        Utilization of these facilities may vary with product mix and economic,
        seasonal, and other business conditions, but none of the principal plants
        are
        substantially idle. The Company's plants, including approved expansions,
        generally have sufficient capacity for existing needs and expected near-term
        growth. These plants are generally well maintained, in good operating condition,
        and suitable and adequate for their use. Unless otherwise indicated, all
        of the
        properties are owned. The locations and general character of the major

ITEM
        3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

General

From
        time
        to time, the Company and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits,
        claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal
        injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
        environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which
        are
        being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the
        Company
        is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based
        upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such
        pending
        matters, including the sorbates litigation and the asbestos litigation, will
        have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results
        of
        operations or cash flows. However, adverse developments could negatively
        impact
        earnings or cash flows in a particular future period.

Sorbates
        Litigation

Two
        civil
        cases relating to sorbates remain. The first is a case filed by a multi-state
        class of indirect purchasers seeking claimed damages, whose claims have been
        dismissed by Tennessee's trial court and that state's court of appeals. The
        Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims,
        and
        subsequently the trial court denied a motion to amend the complaint, ruling
        the
        case over. The Company believes that an appeal of this determination is likely.
        The second is a case filed by New York's attorney general, also seeking claimed
        damages. The trial court has dismissed New York's claims, and the plaintiffs
        have filed a notice of appeal. Briefing on the state's appeal is not yet
        underway.

Asbestos
        Litigation

Over
        the
        years, Eastman has been named as a defendant, along with numerous other
        defendants, in lawsuits in various state courts in which plaintiffs alleged
        injury due to exposure to asbestos at Eastman’s manufacturing sites and sought
        unspecified monetary damages and other relief. Historically, these cases
        have
        been dismissed or settled without a material effect on Eastman’s financial
        condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

In
        recently filed cases, plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos-containing products
        allegedly made by Eastman. Based on its investigation to date, the Company
        has
        information that it manufactured limited amounts of an asbestos-containing
        plastic product between the mid-1960’s and the early 1970’s. The Company’s
        investigation has found no evidence that any of the plaintiffs worked with
        or
        around any such product alleged to have been manufactured by the Company.
        The
        Company intends to defend vigorously the approximately1500 pending claims
        or to
        settle them on acceptable terms.

The
        Company has finalized an agreement with an insurer that issued primary general
        liability insurance to certain predecessors of the Company prior to the
        mid-1970's, pursuant to which that insurer will provide coverage for a portion
        of certain of the Company's defense costs and payments of settlements or
        judgments in connection with asbestos-related lawsuits.

Evaluation
        of the allegations and claims made in recent asbestos-related lawsuits continue
        to be reviewed by the Company. Based on such evaluation to date, the Company
        continues to believe that the ultimate resolution of asbestos cases will
        not
        have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of
        operations, or cash flows, although these matters could result in the Company
        being subject to monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against
        earnings in particular periods. To date, costs incurred by the Company related
        to the recent asbestos-related lawsuits have not been material.


Middelburg
        (Netherlands) Environmental Proceeding

In
        June
        2005, Eastman Chemical Middelburg, B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
        Company, (the "Subsidiary") received a summons from the Middelburg (Netherlands)
        District Court Office to appear before the economic magistrate of that District
        and respond to allegations that the Subsidiary's manufacturing facility in
        Middelburg has exceeded certain conditions in the permit that allows the
        facility to discharge wastewater into the municipal wastewater treatment
        system.
        The summons proposed penalties in excess of $100,000 (USD) as a result of
        the
        alleged violations. A hearing in this matter took place on July 28, 2005,
        at
        which time the magistrate bifurcated the proceeding into two phases: a
        compliance phase and an economic benefit phase. With respect to the compliance
        phase, the magistrate levied a fine of less than $100,000. With respect to
        the
        economic benefit phase, where the prosecutor's proposed penalty in excess
        of
        $100,000 remains pending, the magistrate instructed the parties to submit
        their
        respective positions in writing for his review and deliberation. In accordance
        with the schedule imposed by the magistrate, the Subsidiary submitted its
        initial written position on September 30, 2005. The prosecution submitted
        its
        initial written position on December 23, 2005. The Subsidiary intends to
        vigorously contest this matter, including the assessment of an economic benefit
        penalty, but given the early stage of the proceeding, the ultimate outcome
        cannot presently be determined. This disclosure is made pursuant to SEC
        Regulation S-K, Item 103, Instruction 5.C., which requires disclosure of
        administrative proceedings commenced under environmental laws that involve
        governmental authorities as parties and potential monetary sanctions in excess
        of $100,000. The Company believes that the ultimate resolution
        of this proceeding will not have a material impact on the Company’s
        financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

As
        of
        December 31, 2005, there were 81,637,985 shares of the Company's common stock
        issued and outstanding, which shares were held by 31,657 stockholders of
        record.
        These shares include 106,771 shares held by the Company's charitable foundation.
        The Company has declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per share during the first
        quarter of 2006. Quarterly dividends on common stock, if declared by the
        Company's Board of Directors, are usually paid on or about the first business
        day of the month following the end of each quarter. The payment of dividends
        is
        a business decision to be made by the Board of Directors from time to time
        based
        on the Company's earnings, financial position and prospects, and such other
        considerations as the Board considers relevant. Accordingly, while management
        currently expects that the Company will continue to pay the quarterly cash
        dividend, its dividend practice may change at any time.

SELECTED
        FINANCIAL DATA

In
        2002,
        the Company adopted the non-amortization provisions of Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No.
        142, results for the years after 2001 do not include certain amounts of
        amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that are
        included in prior years’ financial results. If the non-amortization provisions
        of SFAS No. 142 had been applied in the prior years, the Company would not
        have
        recognized amortization expense of $18 million in 2001.

Effective
        January 1, 2003, the Company’s method of accounting for environmental closure
        and postclosure costs changed as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143,
        “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” If the provisions of SFAS No. 143
        had been in effect in prior years, the impact on the Company’s financial results
        would have been immaterial.

MANAGEMENT'S
                DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
                AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL
        ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In
        preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
        principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company’s management
        must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related
        disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting
        principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and
        judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
        and
        expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
        an
        on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related
        to
        allowances for doubtful accounts, impaired assets, environmental costs, U.S.
        pension and other post-employment benefits, litigation and contingent
        liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical
        experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
        under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
        judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
        readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
        estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company’s management
        believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important
        to the fair presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results. These
        policies require management’s more significant judgments and estimates in the
        preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Allowances
        for Doubtful Accounts

The
        Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
        resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
        The
        Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual
        write-offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per
        share
        is low. However, if one of the Company’s key customers were to file for
        bankruptcy, or otherwise be unable to make its required payments, or there
        was a
        significant continued slow down in the economy, the Company could be forced
        to
        increase its allowances. This could result in a material charge to earnings.
        For
        trade receivables of $595 million and $690 million at December 31, 2005 and
        2004, respectively, the Company’s allowances were $20 million and $15 million,
        respectively.

Impaired
        Assets

The
        Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including
        definite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances
        indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and
        circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the
        market value of the asset, adverse change in the extent or manner in which
        the
        asset is being used, significant changes in business climate, or current
        or
        projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets. The carrying
        value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected
        undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is
        less
        than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
        amount
        by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset.
        For
        long-lived assets to be held and used, fair value of fixed (tangible) assets
        and
        definite-lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the
        projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved
        or
        an appraisal. For long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than
        by
        sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values
        are
        reduced for disposal costs.

The
        provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142
        "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require that goodwill and
        indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment
        and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing
        potential future impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill
        and
        indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value,
        as
        established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain
        related products, is less than their carrying value. The Company conducts
        its
        annual testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
        in the third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent
        testing.


MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As
        the
        Company’s assumptions related to long-lived assets are subject to change,
        additional write-downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair
        value
        less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset
        is
        adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recorded fixed
        (tangible) asset impairments of $9 million and definite-lived intangible
        asset
        impairments of $3 million during 2005. The Company recorded fixed (tangible)
        asset impairments of $134 million, definite-lived intangible asset impairments
        of $5 million, and indefinite lived intangible asset impairments of $1 million
        during 2004. The Company recorded fixed (tangible) asset impairments of $291
        million, definite-lived intangible asset impairments of $128 million, indefinite
        lived intangible asset impairments of $47 million, and goodwill impairments
        of
        $34 million during 2003.

Environmental
        Costs

The
        Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that
        the
        Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can
        be
        reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated
        but
        the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum
        amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company’s assumptions
        about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the
        remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other
        potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and
        financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in
        the
        estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement
        action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control
        regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.
        Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from
        the
        minimum or best estimate of $21 million to the maximum of $42 million at
        December 31, 2005.

In
        accordance with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” the
        Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated
        with
        the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as
        defined in SFAS No. 143, include but are not limited to waste management
        units,
        such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these
        types
        of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the
        future
        costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the
        asset
        based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable
        regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings
        over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates
        the useful life of each individual asset up to 50 years. If the Company changes
        its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of
        the
        useful lives of these

assets,
        expenses to be charged into earnings could increase or decrease.

The
        Company’s reserve for environmental contingencies was $51 million and $56
        million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing the minimum
        or
        best estimate for remediation costs and, for asset retirement obligation
        costs,
        the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets'
        estimated useful lives.

United
        States Pension and Other Post-employment Benefits

The
        Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees
        with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and
        health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for
        retirees’ eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these
        benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic
        conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets.
        At
        December 31, 2005, the Company assumed a discount rate of 5.62 percent and
        an
        expected return on assets of 9 percent. The cost of providing plan benefits
        also
        depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover,
        and plan participation.

N/A

The
        expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the
        Company’s pension and other post-employment benefit obligations are established
        each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long-term
        expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds,
        primarily the domestic, international, and private equities markets. The
        assumed
        discount rate is based upon a portfolio of approximately 570 grade Aa corporate
        bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied
        to
        the expected durations of the pension and post-employment benefit obligations.
        If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the difference is recorded
        as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings
        over a
        period of time, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits
        to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2005, 2004, and
        due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due
        to
        actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $56 million,
        $44
        million, and $32 million, respectively. The actual return on assets has exceeded
        the expected return for the last 3 years and a

        percent increase or decrease in the health care trend would have had no material
        impact.

The
        Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post-employment
        obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate will impact the
        cash
        contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2006. However, an after-tax
        charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive
        income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, as of December 31, 2006 for
        the impact on the pension’s projected benefit obligation of the change in
        interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations
        does
        not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication
        of the
        amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future
        years.
        The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest
        rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees,
        and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other
        post-employment obligations,

Litigation
        and Contingent Liabilities

From
        time
        to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits,
        claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal
        injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
        environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which
        are
        handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues
        a
        liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been
        incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount
        cannot
        be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the
        Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including
        those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as
        incurred.

The
        Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters;
        however, results of operations could be affected by significant litigation
        adverse to the Company.

Income
        Taxes

The
        Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary
        differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
        liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the
        year in
        which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the
        deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income
        using
        historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing
        temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies.
        Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is
        more
        likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that
        the
        actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and
        assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could
        have a
        material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement
        of financial position. As of December 31, 2005, a valuation allowance of
        $197
        million has been provided against the deferred tax assets.

        OVERVIEW

Sales
        revenue of $7.1 billion for full year 2005 was the highest in the Company's
        history and a 7 percent increase over 2004.

Operating
        earnings were $757 million in 2005, a $582 million increase from 2004 and
        the
        best since 1995. These results reflect the Company's successful implementation
        of a turnaround strategy to improve profitability which included

extensive
        restructuring, divestitures, and consolidation within the Company,

improved
        pricing strategies and processes and ongoing cost reductions.

The
        significant increases in sales revenue and operating earnings were primarily
        driven by increased selling prices throughout the Company in response to
        increasing raw material and energy costs, and were aided by strong economic
        growth. Operating earnings were also positively impacted by the successful
        completion of previously announced restructuring, divestiture and consolidation
        actions in 2004; a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product
        lines across the Company's portfolio of businesses, including acetyl, olefins,
        and polyester stream optimization; and cost reduction efforts. Included in
        results were a $171 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Company's equity
        investment in Genencor International, Inc. ("Genencor"), a $46 million charge
        associated with the early repayment of long-term debt, and $33 million in
        asset
        impairments and restructuring charges. In the second half of 2005, the Company
        also mitigated the negative effects of the Gulf Coast hurricanes on raw material
        costs and availability through pricing strategies, effective inventory
        management and procurement strategies.

The
        Company's cash flow from operations for 2005 increased by $270 million compared
        with 2004 primarily due to the significant increase in earnings. The Company
        used cash from operations, combined with proceeds from the sale of the Company's
        investment in Genencor, to reduce net debt (long and short term debt minus
        cash
        and cash equivalents) by $636 million. Throughout 2005, the Company maintained
        financial discipline while improving profitability.

With
        the
        successful implementation of the Company's turnaround strategy, as evidenced
        by
        the improved operating results and strengthened financial profile, the Company
        believes that it is positioned for profitable growth. This growth will be
        focused in markets in which the Company has expertise and deep understanding,
        and where it can leverage the technological innovation it has built over
        the
        past 85 years.

Sales
        revenue for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to increased
        selling
        prices of approximately $1 billion throughout the Company that more than
        offset
        a decrease in volume resulting from divested businesses and product lines
        in
        2004. The increase in selling prices was primarily in response to an increase
        in
        raw material and energy costs and the Company’s efforts to improve
        profitability.

        The
        Company expects that raw material and energy costs will continue to be volatile
        during 2006.

        costs for 2005 increased slightly compared with 2004 due primarily to higher

        divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the Coatings,
        Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks ("CASPI") segment and the shutdown
        of
        operations at Cendian Corporation ("Cendian").

R&D
        expenses for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to

expenditures on growth initiatives in the Specialty Plastics ("SP") and

Impairments
        and Restructuring Charges, Net

Impairments
        and restructuring charges totaled $33 million during 2005, consisting of
        non-cash asset impairments of $12 million and restructuring charges of $21
        million. During 2004, these charges totaled $206 million, consisting of non-cash
        asset impairments of $140 million and restructuring charges of $66 million.

        2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other
        Operating Income

Other
        operating income of $2 million for 2005 included a $2 million gain associated
        with a change in estimates for contingencies related to the 2004 divestiture
        of
        certain businesses and product lines within the CASPI segment. Other operating
        income of $7 million in 2004 resulted from the sale of Ariel Research
        Corporation (“Ariel”), formerly part of the DB segment.

Operating
        earnings for 2005 increased $582 million.

Key
        factors in the improved results, aided by strong economic growth,
        were:

·

increased
                  selling prices throughout the Company of approximately $1 billion
                  in
                  response to increasing raw material and energy
                  costs;

·

        rate
        for 2004 was impacted by the treatment of asset impairments and restructuring
        charges resulting in lower expected tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.

SUMMARY
        BY OPERATING
        SEGMENT

The
        Company’s products and operations are managed and reported in three divisions
        comprising six operating segments. Eastman Division consists of the CASPI
        segment, the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segment, and
        the SP
        segment. Voridian Division contains the Polymers segment and the Fibers segment.
        The Developing Businesses Division consists of the DB segment.

For
        and 2004, the Company’s divisional structure provided for goods and services to
        be transferred between the divisions at predetermined prices. Accordingly,
        the
        divisional structure resulted in the recognition of interdivisional sales
        revenue and operating earnings. Such interdivisional transactions are eliminated
        in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

These
        businesses and product lines exclude acrylate ester monomers, composites
        (unsaturated polyester resins), inks and graphic arts raw materials, liquid
        resins, powder resins and textile chemicals divested on July 31, 2004 as
        well as
        other restructuring, divestiture and consolidation activities that the Company
        has completed related to these businesses and product lines.


MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The
        decrease in external sales revenue of $255 million was due to lower sales
        volume
        resulting from the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and product
        lines
        within the segment. Sales revenue for continuing product lines increased
        $186
        million, with selling prices positively impacting revenues 18 percent, driven
        by
        cyclical commodity products.

The
        increase in operating earnings was the result of increased selling prices
        that
        more than offset higher raw material costs; lower asset impairment and
        restructuring charges; an increased focus on more profitable businesses and
        product lines, including the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and
        product lines within the segment; improved gross profit margins, particularly
        for cyclical commodity product lines; and the impact of cost reduction
        efforts.

Operating
        earnings for 2005 and 2004 were reduced by asset impairments and restructuring
        charges totaling approximately $4 million and $81 million, respectively.
        These
        charges are more fully described in Note 16 in the Company’s consolidated
        financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form
        10-K.
        Operating earnings for 2005 included $2 million of other operating income
        related to a change in estimates for contingencies associated with the
        aforementioned sale of certain businesses and product lines within the
        segment.

The
        increase in external sales revenue of $280 million was primarily due to higher
        selling prices which had a positive impact on revenues of $244 million, and
        higher sales volumes, which had a positive impact on revenues of $64 million.
        Selling prices and sales volume were higher particularly in the intermediates
        product lines in response to significant increases in raw material and energy
        costs, an upturn in the olefins cycle, and improved market conditions in
        acetyl
        product lines. The sales volume increase was also attributed to long-term
        arrangements with key customers and increased production capacity.

The
        increase in operating earnings of $145 million was primarily due to increases
        in
        selling prices and ongoing cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher
        raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings for 2005 included $10 million
        of operating earnings from the achievement of certain milestones under an
        acetyls technology licensing agreement.

Operating
        earnings for 2005 include $11 million in asset impairments and restructuring
        charges for previously impaired sites. Operating earnings for 2004 include
        $38
        million in asset impairments related to assets at the Company's Batesville,
        Arkansas and Longview, Texas facilities, as well as severance charges. The
        Company continues to identify and implement projects to reduce costs and
        address
        the performance of underperforming PCI product lines.


MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

External
        sales revenue increased $74 million due to higher selling prices, which had
        a
        positive impact of $75 million. Despite higher sales volume for copolyester
        product lines, particularly for consumer and medical goods, overall sales
        volume
        declined primarily due to the lower sales volume of acetate used in photographic
        film.

Operating
        earnings increased by $51 million compared to 2004 due to lower asset
        impairments and restructuring charges, higher selling prices, improved product
        mix, and ongoing cost reduction efforts partially offset by higher raw material
        and energy costs, and expenditures related to growth initiatives. Operating
        earnings for 2004 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of
        $53
        million related primarily to the closure of the Hartlepool, United Kingdom
        manufacturing facility, as well as severance charges.

VORIDIAN
        DIVISION


MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The
        increase in external sales revenue of $336 million was primarily due to

increased
        selling prices, which had a positive impact of $424 million. The increased
        selling prices were mainly the result of efforts to offset volatile raw material
        and energy costs. The lower sales volume was attributed to several factors:
        the
        effects of higher and volatile raw material and energy costs in North America
        due to the Gulf Coast hurricanes, including the impact of lower raw material
        costs for Asian producers of PET polymers to North America and customers
        working
        down inventories; and low PET polymers industry operating rates in Europe
        and
        Latin America due to a combination of lower than expected demand and
        overcapacity in southern and eastern Europe and Asian imports in South
        America.

Operating
        earnings increased as higher selling prices and reduced costs attributed
        to
        ongoing cost reduction efforts more than offset higher raw material and energy
        costs, resulting in improved margins, primarily in the polyethylene markets
        and
        North American PET markets, prior to the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Operating
        earnings for 2004 were also reduced by asset impairments and restructuring
        charges of $13 million related to severance.

In
        early
        March, 2005, the Company broke ground on the first commercial scale PET polymers
        plant based upon Eastman's

IntegRex

technology. The plant will be a 350,000 metric ton facility and is expected
        to
        begin production in fourth quarter 2006. Research and development efforts
        further enhanced

IntegRex

technology in parallel with construction of the first

IntegRex

manufacturing facility. In September 2005, the Company announced it was
        evaluating a second world-class facility in North America utilizing these
        further refinements to

IntegRex

technology.

The
        Company is evaluating its strategic options related to its non-integrated
        PET
        assets outside the U.S.

External
        sales revenue increased $138 million due to higher selling prices and increased
        sales volume. The higher sales volume was attributed to stronger demand for
        acetate tow, primarily in China, due to higher cigarette production volumes,
        a
        trend towards longer cigarette filters and substitution of acetate tow for
        polypropylene in cigarette filters. Demand for acetate tow in Eastern Europe
        is
        increasing due to increased cigarette production volumes. Market share for
        acetate yarn increased due to the exit of a major competitor from the acetate
        yarn market.

Operating
        earnings increased due to higher sales volumes and increased selling prices
        that
        more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.

The
        Company believes the segment has modest growth potential in future years
        and is
        evaluating growth options in Europe and Asia.

DEVELOPING
        BUSINESSES DIVISION

The
        decrease in external and interdivisional sales revenue was primarily due
        to the
        shutdown of Cendian in the first half of 2005, which resulted in the termination
        of third party contracts and the reintegration of Cendian's logistics functions
        into the Company, and the divestiture of Ariel in fourth quarter 2004.

Operating
        results for the segment improved due to the shutdown of Cendian and
        reintegration of the Company's logistics function. Results included asset
        impairments and restructuring charges of $18 million, primarily related to
        Cendian. With the shutdown of Cendian, the DB segment consists of investments
        in
        early-stage businesses, which the Company continually evaluates using a
        disciplined stage-gating process.

Sales
        revenue in the United States and Canada increased primarily due to higher
        selling prices, particularly for the Polymers, PCI, and CASPI segments, which
        had a $723 million positive impact on sales revenue. The higher selling prices
        mostly related to sales of PET polymers, polyethylene, intermediates chemicals,
        and other cyclical commodity product lines and were primarily in response
        to
        increases in raw material and energy costs and high industry-wide capacity
        utilization. Lower overall sales volumes had a $208 million negative impact
        on
        sales revenue and were primarily due to the impact of the restructuring,
        divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment, partially
        offset
        by significantly higher sales volumes in the PCI segment. The Cendian shutdown
        was reflected in

product
        mix which had a $140 million negative impact on sales revenue.

Sales
        revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa decreased primarily due to
        lower
        sales volumes, mainly the result of the impact of the restructuring,
        divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment, which had
        a $224
        million negative impact on sales revenue. Higher selling prices, particularly
        for PET polymers, had a $77 million positive impact on sales
        revenue.

Sales
        revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher overall selling
        prices
        across all segments which had a $92 million positive impact on sales revenue.
        Higher sales volumes, particularly for the Fibers segment, had a $34 million
        positive impact on sales revenue.

Sales
        revenue in Latin America increased primarily due to higher selling prices,
        partially offset by lower sales volume. Higher selling prices, particularly
        for
        PET polymers, had a $119 million positive impact on sales revenue. Lower
        sales
        volume, particularly for PET polymers and polyethylene, had a $49 million
        negative impact on sales revenue.

With
        a
        substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman
        is
        subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets.
        To
        mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate
        payment terms in U.S. dollars and euros. In addition, where it deems such
        actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions
        and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment
        of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate.

Sales
        revenue increased for 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to increased
        selling
        prices, particularly for the Polymers and the PCI segments, increased sales
        volumes, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, of approximately
        $363
        million, $243 million, and $128 million, respectively. The increase in selling

        costs
        and the Company’s efforts to improve profitability.

                  economic
                  conditions and the substitution of other materials with SP and
                  Polymers

                  as well
                  as improving product mix, particularly in CASPI, SP, and Fibers;

The
        above
        items more than offset higher raw material and energy costs primarily
        attributable to paraxylene, ethylene glycol, propane, coal, and natural
        gas.

The
        Company continued to implement a variety of cost control measures to manage
        discretionary spending. Of the measures taken, a change in vacation policy
        favorably impacted 2003 results by approximately $40 million. This change
        in
        vacation policy did not have a significant impact on 2004 results.

        2004 and 2003, sales revenue increased by 15 percent primarily due to an
        percent increase in volume. Continuing businesses benefited from improved
        end-market demand attributable to strong economic growth and successful
        marketing of existing products in new applications.

Operating
        earnings increased $453 million due to lower asset impairment and restructuring
        charges of approximately $381 million as well as a continued focus on more
        profitable businesses and product lines, increased sales volume, and continued
        cost reduction efforts that were partially offset by higher raw materials
        and
        energy costs, especially propane.

The
        increase in external sales revenue of $249 million was primarily due to
        increased sales volume and higher selling prices. The increase in volume
        had a
        positive impact on sales revenue of $133 million and was attributable to
        improved end-market demand as a result of strong economic growth and
        implementation of long-term supply arrangements with key customers.
        Additionally, higher selling prices, as a result of significantly increased
        raw
        material and energy costs, had a positive impact on sales revenues of $117
        million. The increase in interdivisional sales was due to both higher selling
        prices as a result of higher raw material and energy costs and increased
        volume.

Operating
        earnings increased $61 million, partially due to a decrease in asset impairment
        and restructuring charges of $19 million. Operating earnings were also favorably
        impacted by higher sales volume, higher selling prices, and continued cost
        reduction efforts that more than offset higher raw materials and energy prices.
        Volume growth was primarily due to improved end-market demand as a result
        of
        strong economic growth, implementation of long-term supply arrangements with
        key
        customers and debottlenecking of production capacity at the Longview, Texas
        site. Asset impairment and restructuring charges of $38 million in 2004 relate
        to manufacturing facilities in the Company’s Batesville, Arkansas and Longview,
        Texas sites. Asset impairment and restructuring charges of $57 million in
        related to the Company’s manufacturing site in Llangefni,
        Wales.

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The
        increase in external sales revenue of $85 million for 2004 compared with
        was primarily due to higher sales volume attributed to strong market demand
        for
        products in both new and existing applications including eyewear, housewares,
        and cosmetics packaging in North America and Asia Pacific regions. The increase
        in volume had a positive impact on sales revenue of $65 million.

Operating
        earnings for 2004 decreased $50 million compared with 2003 primarily due
        to
        asset impairments and restructuring charges of $53 million related primarily
        to
        the closure of the Hartlepool, United Kingdom manufacturing site as well
        as
        severance charges related to the Company’s employee separation programs.
        Operating earnings in 2003 included a gain of $20 million on the sale of
        the
        segment’s high performance crystalline plastics assets. In addition, the
        operating earnings improved year over year due to increased sales volumes,
        a
        continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines, and continued
        cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher raw materials and energy
        costs.

MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

External
        sales revenue increased $427 million primarily due to higher selling prices
        and
        increased sales volume. Higher selling prices had a positive impact on sales
        revenue of $211 million, primarily in response to higher raw material and
        energy
        costs and improving market conditions in the second half of 2004. The volume
        increase was mostly a result of continued strong end-market demand for PET
        polymers and continued substitution for other competitive materials in North
        America, Latin America, and Europe and had a positive impact on sales revenue
        of
        $156 million.

Operating
        earnings decreased $37 million, including an asset impairment and restructuring
        charge increase of $11 million. Operating earnings were also impacted by
        increased selling prices and higher sales volumes that were more than offset
        by
        higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for paraxylene and ethylene
        glycol. Included in the 2003 results is a $14 million gain in 2003 from an
        insurance settlement related to the 2002 operational disruptions at the
        Company’s Rotterdam, the Netherlands and Columbia, South Carolina
        facilities.

External
        sales revenue increased $96 million. Increased sales volume had a positive
        impact of $83 million and improved product mix had a $17 million impact on
        revenue. The increase in sales volume and favorable shift in product mix
        were
        primarily attributable to acetyl chemicals in North America and acetate tow
        in
        the Asia Pacific region.

Operating
        earnings increased $21 million primarily due to increased sales volume that
        was
        partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.

MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

External
        sales revenue increased $52 million primarily due to the implementation of
        third-party contracts at Cendian. The increase in interdivisional sales revenue
        for 2004 was primarily due to the increase in logistics services provided
        by
        Cendian to Eastman Division and Voridian Division business segments and the
        increase in sales volumes in those segments.

Operating
        losses increased $21 million primarily due to asset impairments and
        restructuring charges of $21 million mainly related to the restructuring
        of
        Cendian. Also included in 2004 operating results was a $7 million gain from
        the
        sale of Ariel.

In
        2004,
        the operating results for the DB segment were below the Company’s expectations,
        primarily due to the inability of Cendian to achieve sufficient margins to
        offset operating costs. As a result, the Company decided it would reintegrate
        its logistics function. This reintegration was completed in second quarter
        2005.

The
        increase in sales revenue in the United States and Canada for 2004 compared
        with
        2003 was primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly for the Polymers
        and PCI segment, which had a positive impact on sales revenue of $247 million.
        The higher selling prices mostly related to sales of intermediates chemicals,
        PET polymers, and polyethylene, and were primarily in response to increases
        in
        raw material and energy costs and high industry-wide capacity utilization.
        While
        the impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities
        in
        the CASPI segment had a negative impact on sales revenue, overall higher
        sales
        volumes, particularly for the Polymers and PCI segment, had a positive impact
        on
        sales revenue of $192 million.

        sales revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa increased compared with
        2003 due to favorable shifts in foreign currency exchange rates which had
        a
        positive impact on sales revenue of $119 million, primarily due to the
        strengthening of the euro. 2004 sales volume declined 4 percent due to the
        impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation activities in
        the
        CASPI segment. In all other segments, 2004 sales volumes increased compared
        to
        2003.

        sales revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased significantly compared
        with
        2003 primarily due to higher sales volume, particularly in the Fibers segment,
        which had a positive impact on sales revenue of $57 million. A favorable
        shift
        in product mix and higher selling prices, particularly for intermediates
        products in the PCI segment, contributed $42 million and $36 million,
        respectively, to sales revenue.

        sales revenue in Latin America increased significantly compared with 2003
        primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher selling prices, primarily
        related to PET polymers, each of which had a positive impact on sales revenue
        of
        $55 million.

Cash
        provided by operating activities increased $270 million in 2005 compared
        with
        2004 primarily as a result of a significant increase in earnings and a decrease
        in working capital requirements, partially offset by $165 million in
        contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The decrease in working
        capital requirements related primarily to accounts receivable, largely the
        result of improved collection performance which more than offset the increase
        in
        sales, partially offset by an increase in inventories. The Company made $3
        million in contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans in
        2004.

Cash
        provided by operating activities increased $250 million in 2004 compared
        with
        2003 primarily as a result of a reduction in cash funding for U.S. defined
        benefit pension plans. Contributions to the Company's U.S. defined benefit
        pension plans were $238 million in 2003. In addition, net earnings increased
        in
        2004 due to higher gross margins and lower asset impairment charges, and
        were
        partially offset by additional increases in working capital, primarily accounts
        receivable. The additional increase in accounts receivable was the result
        of the
        significant increase in sales in fourth quarter 2004 partially offset by
        improved collection performance.

Cash
        used
        in investing activities decreased $130 million in 2005 compared with 2004
        largely due to $417 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Company's
        investment in Genencor in the second quarter 2005. In addition, in the second
        quarter 2005, the Company received payment for the $50 million note it received
        in the sale of certain businesses and product lines in the CASPI segment.

In
        2004,
        the Company received $115 million in net cash proceeds associated with such
        sale, as well as $12 million in proceeds from the sale of Ariel.

In
        the
        fourth quarter 2005, the Company provided a line of credit up to $125 million
        to
        Primester, a joint venture in which Eastman has a 50 percent interest, which
        Primester fully utilized to repay its third-party borrowings, which had
        previously been guaranteed by Eastman. In addition, t

he
        Company used an additional $95 million for additions to properties and equipment
        in 2005 as compared with 2004.

Cash
        used
        in investing activities in 2004 decreased $12 million compared with 2003.
        In
        2004, the Company sold certain businesses and product lines in its CASPI
        segment
        as well as Ariel, resulting in total net proceeds of $127 million. In 2003,
        the
        Company sold its high-performance crystalline plastics assets and its colorant
        product lines and related assets for $70 million. The Company used an additional
        $18 million for additions to properties and equipment in 2004 as compared
        with
        2003. In 2003, the Company received a return of a deposit of approximately
        $15
        million.

Cash
        used
        in financing activities in 2005 totaled $547 million and included the Company's
        early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long-term debt, and a
        decrease in credit facility and other short-term borrowings, including bank
        overdrafts, of $150 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises
        of $98 million. S

MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cash
        used
        in financing activities in 2004 totaled $579 million and reflects the January
        2004 repayment of $500 million of 6 3/8% notes and a decrease in commercial
        paper, credit facility, and other short-term borrowings, including bank
        overdrafts, of $19 million, offset by cash from stock option exercises of
        $77
        million.

Cash
        provided by financing activities in 2003 totaled $397 million primarily due
        to
        proceeds from long term borrowings of $495 million and an increase in commercial
        paper and other short-term borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $39
        million.

The
        payment of dividends is also reflected in financing activities in all
        periods.

In
        2006,
        priorities for use of available cash will be to pay the quarterly cash dividend,
        fund targeted growth initiatives, and fund defined benefit pension plans.

Liquidity

At
        December 31, 2005, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S. and
        foreign banks totaling approximately $890 million. These credit facilities
        consist of a $700 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility")
        expiring in April 2009, and a 160 million euro credit facility (" the Euro
        Facility") which expires in December, 2010 and has options for two one-year
        extensions. Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest
        at
        varying spreads above quoted market rates. These credit facilities require
        facility fees on the total commitment that are based on Eastman’s credit rating.
        In addition, these credit facilities contain a number of covenants and events
        of
        default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Eastman was
        in
        compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December
        31,
        2005, the Company’s credit facility borrowings totaled $214 million at a
        weighted-average interest rate of 3.01 percent. At December 31, 2004, the
        Company's credit facility borrowings were $146 million at a weighted-average
        interest rate of 2.98 percent.

The
        Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings
        and
        general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper
        borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Since the
        Credit Facility expires in April 2009, any commercial paper borrowings supported
        by the Credit Facility are classified as long-term borrowings because the
        Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long-term basis.

Eastman
        fully utilized the Euro Facility in the fourth quarter 2005 by borrowing
        $189
        million. These funds comprised a significant portion of the funding for the
        repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the
        American Jobs Creation Act.

The
        Company has effective shelf registration statements filed with the Securities
        and Exchange Commission to issue a combined $1.1 billion of debt or equity
        securities.

In
        the
        second quarter 2005, Eastman completed the sale of its equity interest in
        Genencor for approximately $417 million in net cash proceeds after tax. This
        action, combined with strong operating results, allowed the Company to complete
        the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding debt in second quarter
        2005, further strengthening its financial position.

During
        2005, the Company contributed $165 million to U.S. defined benefit pension
        plans. The Company anticipates contributing approximately $75 million to
        U.S.
        defined benefit pension plans during 2006.

Cash
        flows from operations and the sources of capital described above are expected
        to
        be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements including
        those requirements related to the normal seasonal increase in working capital
        expected in the first half of the year. However, the Company’s cash flows from
        operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated
        with
        global operations, raw materials availability and cost, demand for and pricing
        of Eastman’s products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under
        "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below. Furthermore, the Company
        believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade
        company is important to its long term strategic and financial
        flexibility.

Capital
        expenditures were $343 million, $248 million, and $230 million for 2005,
        2004,
        and 2003, respectively. The increase of $95 million in 2005 compared with
        was primarily due to spending on the new PET facility in South Carolina,
        utilizing

IntegRex

technology, as well as other growth initiatives. The Company expects that
        capital spending will be up to $450 million which will exceed estimated 2006
        depreciation and amortization of

approximately
        $300

million.
        In 2006, the Company will continue to pursue projects including a copolyester
        intermediates expansion, the new PET facility in South Carolina, utilizing

Other
        Commitments

At
        December 31, 2005, the Company’s obligations related to notes and debentures
        totaled approximately $1.4 billion to be paid over a period of approximately
        years. Other borrowings, related primarily to credit facility borrowings,
        totaled approximately $214 million.

The
        Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2005 totaling
        approximately $1.7 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for
        materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
        The
        Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under
        cancelable, noncancelable, and month-to-month operating leases totaling
        approximately $208 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease
        commitments, approximately 15 percent relate to machinery and equipment,
        including computer and communications equipment and production equipment;
        approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space,
        storage facilities and land; and approximately 35 percent relate to
        railcars.

In
        addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2005 totaling

        Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company
        for pension and other post-employment benefits in the periods indicated.
        The
        amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health
        care
        trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of
        employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors.
        Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future
        contributions by the Company.


MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Notes
        and
        debentures at December 31, 2005 decreased approximately $500 million compared
        with December 31, 2004 primarily due to the early repayment of $500 million
        of
        its outstanding long-term debt during second quarter 2005. Credit facility
        borrowings increased approximately $70 million at December 31, 2005 compared
        to
        December 31, 2004 due to the funding for the 2005 repatriation of undistributed
        foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.
        Purchase obligations decreased approximately $200 million at December 31,
        compared to December 31, 2004 due to consumption of ethylene glycol and
        polypropylene under existing contracts. Other liabilities decreased
        approximately $120 million at December 31, 2005 compared with December 31,
        due primarily to contributions to the Company's defined benefit pension plans.

Off
        Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements

If
        certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion
        of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing
        of the
        related assets. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances,
        that a material payment pursuant to such guarantees in excess of the payments
        included above is remote. Under these operating leases, the residual value
        guarantees at December 31, 2005 totaled $85 million and consisted primarily
        of
        leases for railcars, company aircraft, and other equipment. Leases with
        guarantee amounts totaling $4 million, $27 million, and $54 million will
        expire
        in 2006, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

As
        described in Note 5 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in Part
        II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Eastman has a 50 percent
        interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture
        which manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company's Kingsport, Tennessee
        plant. During fourth quarter 2005, t

he
        Company provided a line of credit to the joint venture of up to $125 million,
        which Primester fully utilized to pay the principal amount of the joint
        venture's third-party borrowings, previously guaranteed by Eastman.

As
        described in Note 11 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, Eastman
        entered into an agreement in 1999 that allows it to generate cash by reducing
        its working capital through the sale of undivided interests in certain domestic
        trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third
        party. Under this agreement, receivables sold to the third party totaled
        $200
        million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Undivided interests in designated
        receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the
        purchased interest in the receivable pools.

The
        Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated
        entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for
        the
        purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements with contractually
        narrow
        or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing,
        liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such
        relationships.

The
        Company has evaluated material relationships including the guarantees related
        to
        the third-party borrowings of joint ventures described above and has concluded
        that the entities are not Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) or, in the case of
        Primester, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As such,
        in
        accordance with

Financial
        Accounting Standards Board ("

FASB")

Interpretation
        Number 46,

Consolidation
        of Variable Interest Entities

("FIN
        46R")

,
        the
        Company is not required to consolidate these entities. In addition, the Company
        has evaluated long-term purchase obligations with two entities that may be
        VIEs
        at December 31, 2005. These potential VIEs are joint ventures from which
        the
        Company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and
        purchases approximately $60 million of raw materials and utilities on an
        annual
        basis. The Company has no equity interest in these entities and has confirmed
        that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate the potential
        VIE. However, due to competitive and other reasons, the Company has not been
        able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the
        entities are VIEs, and if one or both are VIEs, whether or not the Company
        is
        the primary beneficiary.


MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Guarantees
        and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships
        with suppliers, customers, and non-consolidated affiliates when the Company
        undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified
        triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract could trigger an
        obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon
        alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters,
        and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results
        is
        not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists
        as
        to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities
        resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in
        the
        period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material
        adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
        liquidity.

See
        Note
        10 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8
        of this
        2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K for off balance sheet post-employment benefit
        obligations.

Treasury
        Stock Transactions

The
        Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of its common
        stock. No shares of Eastman common stock were repurchased by the Company
        during
        2005, 2004 or 2003. A total of 2,746,869 shares of common stock at a cost
        of
        approximately $112 million, or an average price of approximately $41 per
        share,
        have been repurchased under the authorization. Repurchased shares may be
        used to
        meet common stock requirements for compensation and benefit plans and other
        corporate purposes.

Dividends

The
        Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per share for a total
        of
        $1.76 per share in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL

Certain
        Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of
        which
        the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various
        governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous
        waste
        sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a
        potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection
        Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
        Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability
        for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur
        costs
        for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal
        Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Adequate reserves for environmental
        contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman’s policies as
        described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in Part
        II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of expected sharing
        of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Company’s preliminary
        assessment of actions that may be required, it does not believe its liability
        for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be
        material to the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
        operations, or cash flows.

The
        Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that
        the
        Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can
        be
        reasonably estimated.

When
        a
        single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated
        within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted
        accrued amount reflects the Company’s assumptions about remediation requirements
        at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions
        with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at
        multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially
        responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based,
        unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety,
        environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements
        could
        result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures
        for
        remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $21 million
        to the
        maximum of $42 million at December 31, 2005.


MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In
        addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for
        closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains.
        Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units,
        such
        as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types
        of
        assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the
        anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on
        its
        expected life and the applicable

regulatory
        closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over
        the
        estimated useful life of the assets.

In
        March
        2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
        Retirement Obligations” ("FIN 47"), which was effective for the Company on
        December 31, 2005. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for
        a
        conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can
        be
        reasonably estimated. The Interpretation also clarifies that the term
        Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation ("CARO") refers to a legal obligation
        to
        perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of
        settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within
        the
        control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have
        sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset
        retirement obligation. The Company performed

a

thorough
        examination of various asset categories

.
        A

lthough
        it may have

CARO

s

at
        certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for
        asbestos abatement activities,

the
        Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair
        value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence
        of
        plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project
        that
        would require the removal of asbestos.

The
        Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as any
        new
        ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when
        and to
        the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning
        applicable retirement costs.

The
        recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated
        financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Reserves
        related to environmental assets accounted for approximately 60 percent of
        the
        total environmental reserve at December 31, 2005. Currently, the Company’s
        environmental assets are expected to be no longer useable at different times
        over the next 50 years. If the Company were to invest in numerous new
        environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant
        number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization
        on
        them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Company’s
        financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood
        of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past
        experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual
        related to environmental assets will be necessary.

INFLATION

In
        recent
        years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on
        Eastman's costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price,
        although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate,
        to
        mitigate short-term market price fluctuations.

For
        additional information see Note 9 to the Company’s consolidated financial
        statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005 Annual Report on Form
        10-K.

RECENTLY
        ISSUED ACCOUNTING
        STANDARDS

In
        November, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of
        Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4”. The Statement adopts the
        International Accounting Standards Board’s view related to inventories that
        abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from
        the
        cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. Additionally, the Statement
        clarifies the meaning of the term 'normal capacity'. The provisions of this
        Statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
        beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has evaluated the effect of SFAS
        No.
        151 and determined that it does not materially impact its consolidated financial
        position, liquidity, or results from operations.


MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In
        December, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(Revised), “Share-Based Payment.”
SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25- "Accounting
        for
        Stock Issued to Employees". SFAS No. 123(R) requires all companies that award
        their employees stock-based compensation to recognize these transactions
        in
        their financial statements based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
        This
        differs from the requirements of SFAS No. 123 which permitted the option
        of
        adopting SFAS No. 123 and reflecting these transactions in the financial
        statements or the continued application of APB Opinion No. 25 requiring only
        pro
        forma disclosure of the effects on net earnings and earnings per share as
        if
        SFAS No. 123 had been adopted. Through the end of 2005, the Company has elected
        to continue the application of APB Opinion No. 25 with the pro forma disclosure
        required for SFAS No. 123. However, the Company is required to implement
        the
        provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006.

SFAS
        No.
        123(R) requires the Company, as of the required effective date of application,
        to implement the standard using a modified version of prospective application.
        Under this method, compensation expense is recognized for the following:
        1) the
        portion of outstanding awards at the effective date of implementation for
        which
        the requisite employee service has not yet been rendered, based upon the
        grant-date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS No. 123 for pro
        forma disclosure purposes, and 2) all new awards, modified awards, repurchased
        awards, or cancelled awards after the effective date of
        implementation.

Under
        previous reporting guidance, the following types of share-based compensation
        awards have been recorded in the financial statements: 1) unrestricted common
        stock awards, 2) restricted common stock awards, 3) stock appreciation rights
        payable in cash and 4) long-term performance awards payable in the form of
        shares of common stock or cash. The implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) includes
        the additional requirement to recognize compensation expense of stock option
        awards in the financial statements. The outstanding quantity and value of
        existing stock option awards at December 31, 2005 for which the requisite
        service period has not been provided and for which compensation expense will
        be
        recognized in the financial statements after the effective date of application
        total 1,990,617 options and approximately $17 million over three years. The
        Company did not modify any awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 to affect
        early vesting which would have eliminated the required service period to
        be
        provided after the effective date of application and eliminated recognition
        of
        compensation expense related thereto. Further, there have not been any changes
        in the quantity or type of share-based payment awards solely due to the
        implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).

The
        determination of the grant-date fair value of share-based compensation awards
        is
        based upon observable prices of financial equity instruments actively traded
        in
        open markets or, if not available, as in the case of the Company's stock
        option
        awards and stock appreciation rights awards, an option pricing financial
        model
        should be used to estimate the fair value of the award. Eastman has relied
        upon
        the use of the Black-Scholes-Merton model to determine the value of its stock
        options and stock appreciation rights under SFAS No. 123 and will continue
        to do
        so under SFAS No. 123(R). As discussed in Note 15

to the
        Company’s consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005
        Annual Report on Form 10-K,

the use
        of any financial model may require the use of highly subjective input
        assumptions that may materially affect the fair value estimate. Refer to
        this
        footnote to review these assumptions for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

All
        share-based employee compensation expense will be reflected in the earnings
        statement within the selling, general and administrative expense line item
        with
        an offset to paid-in-capital or non-current liabilities in the statement
        of
        financial position dependent upon classification as a liability award or
        equity
        award. Awards classified as liabilities require the use of cash or other
        assets
        to effect payment while equity awards reflect payment through stock issuances.
        The federal income tax and state income tax consequences of recognition for
        share-based compensation are reflected in the earnings statement as a credit
        to
        current period income tax expense with an offset in the statement of financial
        position as deferred income taxes in the other non-current assets line item.
        Additionally, SFAS No. 123(R) requires that cash inflows related to the realized
        tax benefits in excess of the amount recorded in the financial statements
        be
        recognized in the statement of cash flows as a cash inflow from financing
        and a
        cash outflow from operating activities.

MANAGEMENT'S
              DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
              AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

These
        plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including
        those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn
        based
        upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends,
        management plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These
        plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily
        subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions
        and
        results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed
        in
        the forward-looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions
        and
        expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the
        factors described in this report, the following are some of the important
        factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially
        from
        those in any such forward-looking statements:

·

The
                  Company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials for its operations
                  and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate,
                  to
                  mitigate short-term market fluctuations in raw material costs.
                  There can
                  be no assurance, however, that such measures will result in cost
                  savings
                  or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. In
                  addition,
                  natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other
                  outbreak
                  of hostilities, or other political factors in any of the countries
                  or
                  regions in which the Company operates or does business, or in countries
                  or
                  regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials, could
                  affect
                  availability and costs of raw
                  materials.

·

While
                  temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally
                  occur,
                  these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover
                  current
                  and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability
                  and
                  price are impacted by natural disasters, plant interruptions occurring
                  during periods of high demand, domestic and world market and political
                  conditions, changes in government regulation, and war or other
                  outbreak of
                  hostilities. Eastman’s operations or products may, at times, be adversely
                  affected by these factors.

·

The
                  Company's competitive position in the markets in which it participates
                  is,
                  in part, subject to external factors in addition to those that
                  the Company
                  can impact. Natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations,
                  war or
                  other outbreak of hostilities, or other political factors in any
                  of the
                  countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business,
                  or in
                  countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials,
                  could negatively impact the Company’s competitive position and its ability
                  to maintain market share. For example, supply and demand for certain
                  of
                  the Company's products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide
                  capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of the
                  Company's
                  products.

·

Limitation
                  of the Company's available manufacturing capacity due to significant
                  disruption in its manufacturing operations, including natural disasters,
                  could have a material adverse affect on sales revenue, costs and
                  results
                  of operations and financial condition.

·

The
                  Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material
                  financial weakness of, certain of the largest customers could adversely
                  affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations
                  until
                  such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the
                  Company
                  would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. In addition,
                  the
                  Company's competitive position may be adversely impacted by low
                  cost
                  competitors in certain regions and customers developing internal
                  or
                  alternative sources of supply.

·

In
                  addition to productivity and cost reduction initiatives, the Company
                  is
                  striving to improve margins on its products through price increases
                  where
                  warranted and accepted by the market; however, the Company's earnings
                  could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized,
                  not be
                  sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs, or
                  have a
                  negative impact on demand and volume. There can be no assurances
                  that
                  price increases will be realized or will be realized within the
                  Company’s
                  anticipated timeframe.

·

The
                  Company is endeavoring to exploit growth opportunities in certain
                  core
                  businesses by developing new products, expanding into new markets,
                  and
                  tailoring product offerings to customer needs. There can be no
                  assurance
                  that such efforts will result in financially successful commercialization
                  of such products or acceptance by existing or new customers or
                  new
                  markets.


MANAGEMENT'S
          DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
          AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

·

The
                  Company has made, and intends to continue making, strategic investments,
                  including

IntegRex

technology,
                  and has entered, and expects to continue to enter, into strategic
                  alliances in technology, services businesses, and other ventures
                  in order
                  to build, diversify, and strengthen certain Eastman capabilities
                  and to
                  maintain high utilization of manufacturing assets. There can be
                  no
                  assurance that such investments and alliances will achieve their
                  underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial
                  to the Company's results of
                  operations.

·

The
                  Company has undertaken and expects to continue to undertake productivity
                  and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings
                  to
                  improve performance and generate cost savings. There can be no
                  assurance
                  that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated
                  cost savings from such activities will be
                  realized.

·

The
                  Company's facilities and businesses are subject to complex health,
                  safety
                  and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will
                  continue to
                  require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such
                  laws
                  and regulations currently and in the future. The Company's accruals
                  for
                  such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in
                  estimates
                  on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the
                  Company’s
                  assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated
                  site, the
                  nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory
                  agencies
                  and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites,
                  and the
                  number and financial viability of other potentially responsible
                  parties.
                  Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated
                  government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety,
                  environmental, chemical control regulations and testing requirements
                  could
                  result in higher or lower costs.

·

The
                  Company and its operations from time to time are parties to or
                  targets of
                  lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product
                  liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property,
                  commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety,
                  and
                  employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary
                  course
                  of business. The Company believes amounts reserved are adequate
                  for such
                  pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected
                  by
                  significant litigation adverse to the
                  Company.

·

The
                  Company has deferred tax assets related to capital and operating
                  losses.
                  The Company establishes valuation allowances to reduce these deferred
                  tax
                  assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
                  The
                  Company’s ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends on
                  projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary
                  differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Realization
                  of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of
                  time. As a
                  result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future
                  taxable
                  income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments
                  to these
                  assets.

The
        foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor
        necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including
        that
        under "Outlook" and "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors," and other
        forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in
        this
        Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere from time to time, represents
        management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company
        does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether
        as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required
        by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company
        disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
        or
        in Company press releases) on related subjects.


ITEM
        7A.

QUANTITATIVE
        AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET
        RISK

The
        Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal
        course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as
        well
        as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations.
        To
        mitigate the Company's exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established
        policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of
        financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its
        exposure to such risks.

The
        Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis, which
        measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected
        hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
        and/or
        commodity prices.

The
        Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of
        its
        borrowing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain
        liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements.
        Currently, these borrowings are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The
        nature and amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt may vary
        as a
        result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors.
        In
        2005, for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair
        value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the Company changed to a one
        percent absolute shift in interest rates from a 10 percent relative shift
        in
        interest rates which was used in 2004. For 2005 and 2004, the market risks
        associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, assuming
        an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of 1 percent were
        approximately $134 million and $158 million, respectively. This exposure
        is
        primarily related to long-term debt with fixed interest rates.

The
        Company's operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies
        are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
        continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market
        conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order
        to
        mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company enters into forward
        exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign
        currencies and currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet
        committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more
        than
        five years and denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on
        these
        contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Company's
        policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered
        necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter
        into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes. At December
        31,
        2005, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts or currency
        options. For 2005, the market risks associated with borrowings denominated
        in
        foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar
        relative to each foreign currency was approximately $19 million and an
        additional $1.9 million for each additional one percentage point adverse
        change
        in foreign currency rates. For 2004, the market risks associated with forward
        exchange contracts utilizing a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model
        and a
        10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency
        hedged by the Company were approximately $15 million and an additional $1.4
        million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign
        currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2004, the Company's outstanding
        borrowings denominated in foreign currencies were immaterial. Further adverse
        movements in foreign currencies would create losses in fair value; however,
        such
        losses would not be linear to that disclosed above. This exposure, which
        is
        primarily related to foreign currency options purchased by the Company to
        manage
        fluctuations in foreign currencies, is limited to the dollar value of option
        premiums payable by the Company for the related financial instruments.
        Furthermore, since the Company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative
        instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss
        in
        fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the
        value
        of the underlying anticipated transactions.

The
        Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major
        raw
        materials and energy. To mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices
        for
        certain commodities, principally propane and natural gas, the Company enters
        into forwards and options contracts. For 2005 and 2004, the market risks
        associated with options and swaps for feedstock and natural gas assuming
        an
        instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent
        were $2 million and $1 million, respectively, and an additional $0.1 million
        for
        each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter for both
        periods.

MANAGEMENT'S

RESPONSIBILITY
        FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management
        is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the accompanying
        consolidated financial statements of Eastman appearing on pages 74 through
        120.
        Eastman has prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance
        with
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the
        statements of necessity include some amounts that are based on management's
        best
        estimates and judgments.

Eastman's
        accounting systems include extensive internal controls designed to provide
        reasonable assurance of the reliability of its financial records and the
        proper
        safeguarding and use of its assets. Such controls are based on established
        policies and procedures, are implemented by trained, skilled personnel with
        an
        appropriate segregation of duties, and are monitored through a comprehensive
        internal audit program. The Company's policies and procedures prescribe that
        the
        Company and all employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and
        that
        its business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a manner
        that
        is above reproach.

The
        consolidated financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
        LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who were responsible
        for
        conducting their audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Their report is included
        herein.

The
        Board
        of Directors exercises its responsibility for these financial statements
        through
        its Audit Committee, which consists entirely of nonmanagement Board members.
        The
        independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have
        full
        and free access to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee meets periodically
        with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Eastman's director of internal auditing,
        both privately and with management present, to discuss accounting, auditing,
        policies and procedures, internal controls, and financial reporting
        matters.


REPORT
        OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
        FIRM

To
        the
        Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Eastman
        Chemical Company:

We
        have
        completed integrated audits of Eastman Chemical Company’s 2005 and 2004
        consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
        reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
        financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits,
        are presented below.

Consolidated
        financial statements

In
        our
        opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing
        under Item 15(a)(1) on page 124 present fairly, in all material respects,
        the
        financial position of Eastman Chemical Company and its subsidiaries at December
        31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
        for
        each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity
        with
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
        These
        financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
        responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
        on
        our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
        the
        standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
        Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
        assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
        misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
        basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
        made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
        We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
        opinion.

As
        discussed in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements, on January
        1,
        2003 Eastman Chemical Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”.

Internal
        control over financial reporting

Also,
        in
        our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on
        Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
        Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
        of
        December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
        Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
        Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
        criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
        respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
        31,
        2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
        issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
        effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
        of
        the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
        responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the
        effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
        on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
        reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
        perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
        obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
        evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
        operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
        procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
        our
        audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.


A
        company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
        to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
        fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
        (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
        necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
        generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
        of
        the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
        and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
        regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
        or
        disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
        financial statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.

SIGNIFICANT
                    ACCOUNTING
                    POLICIES

Financial
          Statement Presentation

The
          consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company and subsidiaries
          ("Eastman" or the "Company") are prepared in conformity with accounting
          principles generally accepted in the United States and of necessity include
          some
          amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. Future
          actual
          results could differ from such current estimates. The consolidated financial
          statements include assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of all
          majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Eastman accounts for other
          joint
          ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises
          significant influence on the equity basis. Intercompany transactions and
          balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash
          and Cash Equivalents

Cash
          and
          cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities
          with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date.

Accounts
          Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade
          accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
          interest. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
          losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
          The allowances are based on the number of days an individual receivable
          is
          delinquent and management’s regular assessment of the financial condition of the
          Company’s customers. The Company considers that a receivable is delinquent if it
          is unpaid after the terms of the related invoice have expired. The Company
          evaluates the allowance based on a monthly assessment of the aged receivables.
          Write-offs are done at the time a customer receivable is deemed
          uncollectible.

Inventories

Inventories
          are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company determines the cost
          of
          most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in
          the
          United States by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method. The cost of all
          other
          inventories, including inventories outside the United States, is determined
          by
          the average cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out ("FIFO")
          method. The Company writes-down its inventories for estimated obsolescence
          or
          unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value
          of
          inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
          demand and market conditions.

Properties

The
          Company records properties at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged
          to
          earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. When Eastman retires
          or
          otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related
          accumulated depreciation from the accounts. The Company records any profit
          or
          loss on retirement or other disposition in earnings. Asset impairments
          are
          reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation

Depreciation
          expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful
          lives of
          the assets (buildings and building equipment 20 to 50 years; machinery
          and
          equipment 3 to 33 years), generally using the straight-line method.


Computer
          Software Costs

Capitalized
          software costs are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over three
          years, the expected useful life of such assets, beginning when the software
          project is substantially complete and placed in service. Capitalized software
          in
          2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $11 million, $14 million, and $15
          million,
          respectively. During those same periods, approximately $16 million, $18
          million,
          and $23 million, respectively, of previously capitalized costs were amortized.
          At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the unamortized capitalized software costs
          were
          $24 million and $29 million, respectively.

Impaired
          Assets

The
          Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including
          definite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances
          indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and
          circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in
          the
          market value of the asset, adverse change in the extent or manner in which
          the
          asset is being used, significant changes in business climate, or current
          or
          projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets. The carrying
          value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected
          undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and
          is less
          than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
          amount
          by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset.
          For
          long-lived assets to be held and used, fair value of fixed (tangible) assets
          and
          definite-lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the
          projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved
          or
          an appraisal. For long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other
          than by
          sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values
          are
          reduced for disposal costs.

The
          provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
          "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require that goodwill and
          indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment
          and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing
          potential future impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill
          and
          indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value,
          as
          established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of
          certain
          related products, is less than their carrying value. The Company conducts
          its
          annual testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
          in the third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent
          testing.

Investments

The
          consolidated financial statements include the accounts in which the Company
          is a
          primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, if applicable, or the
          accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries in which a controlling
          interest
          is maintained. For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company’s
          ownership is less than 100 percent, the interests of the other stockholders
          are
          included in other long-term liabilities.

Investments
          in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not
          a
          controlling interest are carried on the equity basis. Under the equity
          method of
          accounting, these investments are included in other noncurrent assets.
          The
          Company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in
          other
          income and charges and its share of other comprehensive income (loss) in
          the
          appropriate component of other accumulated comprehensive income (loss)
          in
          stockholders’ equity.

Marketable
          securities held by the Company, currently common or preferred stock, are
          deemed
          by management to be available-for-sale and are reported at fair value,
          with net
          unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other accumulated
          comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and
          losses
          are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification
          method for determining the cost of securities. The Company includes these
          investments in other noncurrent assets.


Other
          equity investments, for which fair values are not readily determinable,
          are
          carried at historical cost and are included in other noncurrent
          assets.

The
          Company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment,
          accounted for by the Company as a marketable security or recorded at historical
          cost, has experienced a decline in value that is other than
          temporary.

Pension
          and Other Post-employment Benefits

The
          Company maintains defined benefit plans that provide eligible employees
          with
          retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and
          health
          care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees’
eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits
          reflect
          the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly
          interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase
          for employees, and health care cost trends. The cost of providing plan
          benefits
          depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover,
          and plan participation.

Environmental
          Costs

The
          Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that
          the
          Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount
          can be
          reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated
          but
          the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum
          amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company’s assumptions
          about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of
          the
          remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other
          potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and
          financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in
          the
          estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement
          action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control
          regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower
          costs.

The
          Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated
          with
          the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets include
          but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water
          treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed
          or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated
          to be
          associated with the closure of the site

based
          on
          an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory
          closure requirements. These expenses are charged into earnings over the
          estimated useful life of the assets.

Currently,
          the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset up to 50
          years.
          If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation
          costs or
          its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, the expenses to be charged
          into earnings could increase or decrease.

In
          March
          2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation
          No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” ("FIN 47"),
          which was effective for the Company on December 31, 2005. FIN 47 requires
          an
          entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation
          when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation
          also clarifies that the term Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation ("CARO")
          refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
          which
          the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event
          that
          may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies
          when
          an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the
          fair
          value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company performed

a

thorough
          examination of various asset categories

.
          A

lthough
          it may have

CARO

s

at
          certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential
          for
          asbestos abatement activities,

the
          Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in
          fair
          value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence
          of
          plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project
          that
          would require the removal of asbestos.

The
          Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as
          any new
          ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when
          and to
          the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning
          applicable retirement costs.

Those
          obligations recorded did not have a material impact on its consolidated
          financial position, results of operations and cash flows.


Accruals
          for environmental liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities
          and
          exclude claims for recoveries from insurance companies or other third parties.
          Environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related
          property, increase its capacity, and/or mitigate or prevent future
          contamination. The cost of operating and maintaining environmental control
          facilities is charged to expense.

The
          Company's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement
          were estimated to be approximately $198 million, $184 million and $187
          million
          in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts pertain primarily to
          operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and
          facilities, but also include expenditures for construction and development.
          The
          Company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising
          from
          requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations
          to
          materially increase the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures
          for environmental control facilities.

Derivative
          Financial Instruments

Derivative
          financial instruments are used by the Company in the management of its
          exposures
          to fluctuations in foreign currency, raw materials and energy costs, and
          interest rates. Such instruments are used to mitigate the risk that changes
          in
          exchange rates or raw materials and energy costs will adversely affect
          the
          eventual dollar cash flows resulting from the hedged transactions.

The
          Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments
          denominated in foreign currencies and currency options and forwards to
          hedge
          probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase
          transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in
          foreign
          currencies (principally the British pound, Canadian dollar, euro, and the
          Japanese yen). To mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for
          propane
          and natural gas (major raw materials and energy used in the manufacturing
          process), the Company enters into forwards and options contracts. From
          time to
          time, the Company also utilizes interest rate derivative instruments, primarily
          swaps, to hedge the Company's exposure to movements in interest
          rates.

The
          Company's forwards and options contracts are accounted for as hedges because
          the
          derivative instruments are designated and effective as hedges and reduce
          the
          Company's exposure to identified risks. Gains and losses resulting from
          effective hedges of existing assets, liabilities, firm commitments, or
          anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized when the offsetting
          gains
          and losses are recognized on the related hedged items and are reported
          as a
          component of operating earnings.

Deferred
          currency option premiums are generally included in other assets. The related
          obligation for payment is generally included in other liabilities and is
          paid in
          the period in which the options are exercised or expire and forward exchange
          contracts mature.

Litigation
          and Contingent Liabilities

The
          Company and its operations from time to time are parties to or targets
          of
          lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability,
          personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial,
          contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters,
          which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The
          Company
          accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability
          has
          been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single
          amount
          cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range,
          the
          Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including
          those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as
          incurred.


Revenue
          Recognition and Customer Incentives

The
          Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
          delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the
          customer
          is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

The
          Company records estimated obligations for customer programs and incentive
          offerings, which consist primarily of revenue or volume-based amounts that
          a
          customer must achieve over a specified period of time, as a reduction of
          revenue
          to each underlying revenue transaction as the customer progresses toward
          reaching goals specified in incentive agreements. These estimates are based
          on a
          combination of forecast of customer sales and actual sales volumes and
          revenues
          against established goals, the customer’s current level of purchases, and
          Eastman’s knowledge of customer purchasing habits, and industry pricing
          practice. The incentive payment rate may be variable, based upon the customer
          reaching higher sales volume or revenue levels over a specified period
          of time
          in order to receive an agreed upon incentive payment.

Shipping
          and Handling Fees and Costs

Shipping
          and handling fees related to sales transactions are billed to customers
          and are
          recorded as sales revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded
          in
          cost of sales.

Restructuring
          of Operations

The
          Company records restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation
          of operations, exited business lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that
          are
          expected to be substantially completed within 12 months. These restructuring
          charges are recognized as incurred, and are associated with site closures,
          legal
          and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, or other
          costs
          directly related to the restructuring. The Company records severance charges
          for
          involuntary employee separations when the separation is probable and reasonably
          estimable. The Company records severance charges for voluntary employee
          separations ratably over the remaining service period of those
          employees.

Stock-based
          Compensation

As
          permitted by SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," Eastman
          continued to apply intrinsic value accounting under the requirements of
          Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25 for its stock option
          plans
          through December 31, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation cost
          for stock
          options, if any, is measured as the excess of the quoted market price of
          the
          stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire
          the
          stock. Eastman adopted disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS
          No.
          148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an
          Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” through December 31, 2005. The Company’s
          pro forma net earnings and pro forma earnings per share based upon the
          fair
          value at the grant dates for stock option awards under Eastman’s plans are
          disclosed below.


If
          the
          Company had elected to recognize compensation expense as required by SFAS
          No.
          123 based upon the fair value at the grant dates for stock option awards
          under
          these plans, the Company's net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per
          share
          would have been impacted as follows:

was

          25. SFAS
          No. 123(R) is required to be implemented January 1, 2006 for calendar year-end
          companies. SFAS No. 123(R) retains most of the requirements of SFAS No.
          123 and
          SFAS No. 148 by requiring companies to record compensation expense in the
          financial statements for stock option awards determined at the grant date
          fair
          value. For more information regarding the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R)

Compensated
          Absences

The
          Company accrues compensated absences and related benefits as current charges
          to
          earnings in the period earned.

Other
          Income and Other Charges

Included
          in other income and other charges are results from equity investments,
          royalty
          income, gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions, certain litigation
          costs, fees on securitized receivables and other miscellaneous
          items.

Income
          Taxes

The
          provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability
          approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred
          taxes
          represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported
          amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision
          for
          income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year
          plus
          the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from
          differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and
          liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when
          changes
          are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets
          when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
          Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries
          and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to
          be
          permanently reinvested.

GOODWILL
                    AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSET

S

Following
          are the Company’s amortizable intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible
          assets. The difference between the gross carrying amount and net carrying
          amount
          for each item presented is attributable to impairments and accumulated
          amortization.

Other
          intangible assets are included in other noncurrent assets on the balance
          sheet.

During
          the fourth quarter 2005, the Company recorded approximately $3 million
          in
          intangible asset impairments related to patents.

Amortization
          expense for definite-lived intangible assets was approximately $1 million,
          $2
          million, and $10 million, respectively, for 2005, 2004, and 2003. Estimated
          amortization expense for the five succeeding years is less than $1 million
          per
          year.

EQUITY
                    INVESTMENTS AND OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS AND
                    LIABILITIES

On
          April
          21, 2005, the Company completed the sale of its equity investment in Genencor
          International, Inc. ("Genencor") for cash proceeds of approximately $417
          million, net of $2 million in fees. The book value of the investment prior
          to
          sale was $246 million, and the Company recorded

a
          pre-tax
          gain on the sale of $171 million.

As
          of
          December 31, 2004, Eastman owned 25 million shares, or approximately 42
          percent,
          of the outstanding common shares of Genencor, a publicly traded biotechnology
          company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and marketing
          of
          biotechnology products for the industrial chemicals, agricultural, and
          health
          care markets, and a developer of integrated genomics technology. This investment
          was accounted for under the equity method and was included in other noncurrent
          assets in 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s investment in
          Genencor, including preferred stock and accumulated dividends receivable,
          was
          $242 million. At December 31, 2004, the fair market value of the Company’s
          common stock investment in Genencor was $16.40 per share, or $410
          million.

Summarized
          financial information for Genencor is shown on a 100 percent basis.

In
          addition, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating
          partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate
          at
          Eastman's Kingsport, Tennessee plant. This investment is accounted for
          under the
          equity method.

During
          fourth quarter 2005, t

he
          Company provided a line of credit to the joint venture of up to $125 million,
          which Primester fully utilized to repay the principal amount of the joint
          venture's third-party borrowings, previously guaranteed by Eastman. The
          Company
          holds an interest-bearing note receivable. Eastman's investment in the
          joint
          venture at December 31, 2005 was approximately $86 million, which was comprised
          of the recognized portion of the venture's accumulated deficits and the
          line of
          credit of $125 million. Such amount was included in other noncurrent assets.
          Eastman had a negative investment in the joint venture at December 31,
          2004 of
          approximately $40 million, which was included in other long-term liabilities
          and
          represented the recognized portion of the venture's accumulated deficits.
          The
          Company provides certain utilities and general plant services to the joint
          venture. In return for Eastman providing those services, the joint venture
          paid
          Eastman a total of $39 million in three equal installments in 1991, 1992,
          and
          1993. Eastman has amortized the deferred credit to earnings over the 10-year
          period of the utilities and plant services contract, which concluded in
          April
          2004.

Eastman
          also owns a 50 percent interest in Nanjing Yangzi Eastman Chemical Ltd.
          (“Nanjing”), a company which manufactures

Eastotac

hydrocarbon tackifying resins for the adhesives market. This joint venture
          is
          accounted for under the equity method and is included in other noncurrent
          assets. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s investment in Nanjing was
          approximately $5 million and $4 million, respectively.

BORROWINGS

At
          December 31, 2005, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S.
          and
          foreign banks totaling approximately $890 million. These credit facilities
          consist of a $700 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility")
          expiring in April 2009, as well as a 160 million euro credit facility ("Euro
          Facility") which expires in December 2010, and has options for two one-year
          extensions. Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest
          at
          varying spreads above quoted market rates. These credit facilities require
          facility fees on the total commitment that are based on Eastman’s credit rating.
          In addition, these credit facilities contain a number of covenants and
          events of
          default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. At December
          31,
          2005, the Company’s credit facility borrowings totaled $214 million at a
          weighted-average interest rate of 3.01 percent. At December 31, 2004, the
          Company's credit facility borrowings were $146 million at a weighted-average
          interest rate of 2.98 percent

The
          Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings
          and
          general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper
          borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Since
          the
          Credit Facility expires in April 2009, any commercial paper borrowings
          supported
          by the Credit Facility are classified as long-term borrowings because the
          Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long-term basis.

Eastman
          fully utilized the Euro Facility in the fourth quarter 2005 which provided
          the
          Company $189 million. These funds comprised a significant portion of the
          funding
          for the 2005 dividend repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act.
          See
          Note 19 for more information on the American Jobs Creation Act.


The
          Company completed the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding
          long-term bonds in the second quarter 2005. See Note 8 for further information
          regarding the early extinguishment of this debt.

The
          Company entered into interest rate swaps in the third quarter 2003 that
          converted the effective interest rate on $250 million of the $400 million
          7%
          notes due in 2012 to variable rates. In the second quarter 2004, the Company
          entered into interest rate swaps that converted the effective interest
          rate on
          $100 million of the $400 million 7% notes due in 2012 to variable rates.
          The
          Company settled $50 million of these interest rate swaps during the first
          quarter 2005. Cash proceeds received and the gain resulting from the settlement
          were immaterial. During the second quarter 2005, the Company received cash
          proceeds and recognized a gain of approximately $2 million resulting from
          the
          settlement of $155 million of these interest rate swaps in connection with
          the
          early extinguishment of debt. The average rate on the variable portion
          was 6.75
          percent at December 31, 2005 and 5.18 percent at December 31, 2004. The
          recording of the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding
          debt resulted in a decrease of $6 million in long-term borrowings and other
          noncurrent assets at December 31, 2005. The fair values of the interest
          rate
          swaps were a liability of $4 million at December 31, 2005, and an asset
          of $2
          million at December 31, 2004.

The
          Company entered into interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter 2003 that
          converted the effective interest rate of $150 million of the $250 million
          6.30%
          notes due in 2018 to variable rates. The average rate on the variable portion
          was 5.16 percent at December 31, 2005, and 3.71 percent at December 31,
          2004.
          The recording of the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding
          debt resulted in a slight decrease in long-term borrowings and other noncurrent
          assets at December 31, 2005. The fair values of the interest rate swaps
          were
          assets of $5 million at December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004,
          respectively.

                    EXTINGUISHMENT OF
                    DEBT

In
          the
          second quarter 2005, the Company completed the early repayment of $500
          million
          of its outstanding long-term bonds for $544 million in cash, which resulted
          in a
          charge of $46 million for early debt extinguishment costs including $2
          million
          in unamortized bond issuance costs. The book value of the purchased debt
          was
          $500 million, as follows:

          value.

Hedging
          Programs

Financial
          instruments held as part of the hedging programs discussed below are recorded
          at
          fair value based upon comparable market transactions as quoted by the
          broker.

The
          Company is exposed to market risk, such as changes in currency exchange
          rates,
          raw material and energy costs and interest rates. The Company uses various
          derivative financial instruments pursuant to the Company's hedging policies
          to
          mitigate these market risk factors and their effect on the cash flows of
          the
          underlying transactions. Designation is performed on a specific exposure
          basis
          to support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging
          instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in
          the cash
          flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The Company does not hold
          or
          issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Currency
          Rate Hedging

The
          Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout
          the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency
          exchange
          rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company
          nets
          the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets.
          To
          manage the remaining exposure, the Company enters into forward exchange
          contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies
          and currency options and forwards to hedge probable anticipated, but not
          yet
          committed, export sales transactions expected within no more than five
          years and
          denominated in foreign currencies (principally the British pound, Canadian
          dollar, euro and the Japanese yen). These contracts are designated as cash
          flow
          hedges. The mark-to-market gains or losses on qualifying hedges are included
          in
          accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective,
          and
          reclassified into sales in the period during which the hedged transaction
          affects earnings.

Raw
          Material and Energy Hedging

Raw
          materials and energy sources used by the Company are subject to price volatility
          caused by weather, supply conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable
          factors. To mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for propane
          and
          natural gas, the Company enters into forwards and options contracts. These
          contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The mark-to-market gains
          or losses
          on qualifying hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
          (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in
          the
          period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. In evaluating
          effectiveness, the Company excludes the time value of certain options.


Interest
          Rate Hedging

The
          Company's policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable
          rate debt. To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Company enters
          into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange the difference
          between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to
          an agreed
          upon notional principal amount. These swaps are designated to hedge the
          fair
          value of underlying debt obligations with the interest rate differential
          reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps.
          As
          these instruments are 100 percent effective, there is no impact on earnings
          due
          to hedge ineffectiveness.

From
          time
          to time, the Company also utilizes interest rate derivative instruments,
          primarily swaps, to hedge the Company’s exposure to movements in interest rates
          on anticipated debt offerings. These instruments are designated as cash
          flow
          hedges and are typically 100 percent effective. As a result, there is no
          current
          impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. The mark-to-market gains
          or
          losses on these hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive
          income
          (loss) to the extent effective, and are reclassified into interest expense
          over
          the period of the related debt instruments.

At
          December 31, 2005, mark-to-market losses from raw material, currency, energy
          and
          certain interest rate hedges that were included in accumulated other
          comprehensive income (loss) totaled approximately $5 million. If
          realized, substantially all of these losses will be reclassified into
          earnings during the next 12 months. The mark-to-market gains or losses
          on
          non-qualifying, excluded and ineffective portions of hedges are immediately
          recognized in cost of sales or other income and charges. Such amounts had
          a
          negative $6 million impact on earnings during 2005.

At
          December 31, 2004, mark-to-market losses from raw material, currency, energy
          and
          certain interest rate hedges that were included in accumulated other
          comprehensive income (loss) totaled approximately $8 million. Substantially
          all
          of these losses were reclassified into earnings during 2005. The mark-to-market
          gains or losses on non-qualifying, excluded and ineffective portions of
          hedges
          are immediately recognized in cost of sales or other income and charges.
          Such
          amounts had a negative $5 million impact on earnings during 2004.

RETIREMENT
                    PLANS

Eastman
          maintains defined benefit plans that provide eligible employees with retirement
          benefits. Prior to 2000, benefits were calculated using a defined benefit
          formula based on age, years of service, and the employee’s final average
          compensation as defined in the plans. Effective January 1, 2000, the Company's
          defined benefit pension plan, the Eastman Retirement Assistance Plan, was
          amended. Employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to January 1,
          2000 are
          calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age,
          years of
          service and final average compensation as defined in the plans. The amended
          defined benefit pension plan uses a pension equity formula based on age,
          years
          of service and final average compensation to calculate an employee's retirement
          benefits from January 1, 2000 forward. Benefits payable will be the combined
          pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits.

Benefits
          are paid to employees from trust funds. Contributions to the plan are made
          as
          permitted by laws and regulations. The pension trust fund does not directly
          own
          any of the Company’s common stock.

Pension
          coverage for employees of Eastman's international operations is provided,
          to the
          extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The Company systematically
          provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees,
          under insurance policies or by book reserves.

Below
          is
          a summary balance sheet of the change in plan assets during 2005 and 2004,
          the
          funded status of the plans, amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial
          Position, and a Summary of Benefit Costs.


The
          assumptions used to develop the projected benefit obligation for the Company's
          significant defined benefit pension plans are also provided in the following
          tables.

The
          accumulated benefit obligation basis at the end of 2005 and 2004 was $1,388
          million and $1,309 million, respectively. The Company uses a measurement
          date of
          December 31 for the majority of its pension plans.

The
          fair
          value of plan assets for domestic plans at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was
          $939
          million and $773 million, respectively, while the fair value of plan assets
          at
          December 31, 2005 and 2004 for non-U.S. plans was $115 million and $105
          million,
          respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the expected long-term rate
          of
          return on the U.S. plan assets was 9 percent, while the expected long-term
          rate
          of return on non-U.S. plan assets was 5.75 percent and 6.12 percent at
          December

The
          Company’s investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to
          maximize long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level
          of
          risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. The investment
          policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the
          fund
          is managed within those ranges. The plans use a number of investment approaches
          including equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying
          securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. The
          U.S.
          plan also invests in private equity and other funds.

The
          expected rate of return was determined by modeling the expected long-term
          rates
          of return for broad categories of investments held by the plan against
          a number
          of various potential economic scenarios.

The
          Company anticipates pension contributions to its U.S. defined benefit plans
          for
          2006 to be approximately $75 million, including quarterly contributions
          as
          required by the Internal Revenue Code section 412.

Benefits
          expected to be paid from pension plans are as follows:

DEFINED
          CONTRIBUTION PLANS

The
          Company sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the
          "ESOP"), a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
          Code,
          which is a component of the Eastman Investment Plan and Employee Stock
          Ownership
          Plan ("EIP/ESOP"). Eastman anticipates that it will make annual contributions
          for substantially all U.S. employees equal to 5 percent of eligible compensation
          to the ESOP, or for employees who have five or more prior ESOP contributions,
          to
          either the Eastman Stock Fund or other investment funds within the EIP.
          Employees may diversify to other investment funds within the EIP from the
          ESOP
          at any time without restrictions. Allocated shares in the ESOP totaled
          1,980,906; 2,210,590; and 2,582,229 shares as of December 31, 2005, 2004
          and
          2003, respectively. Dividends on shares held by the EIP/ESOP are charged
          to
          retained earnings. All shares held by the EIP/ESOP are treated as outstanding
          in
          computing earnings per share.

Charges
          for domestic contributions to the EIP/ESOP were $33 million, $34 million,
          and
          $35 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


POSTRETIREMENT
          WELFARE PLANS

Eastman
          provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees,
          and
          health care benefits for retirees' eligible survivors. In general, Eastman
          provides those benefits to retirees eligible under the Company's U.S. pension
          plans. Similar benefits are also provided to retirees of Holston Defense
          Corporation (“HDC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that, prior to
          January 1, 1999, operated a government-owned ammunitions plant. HDC’s contract
          with the Department of Army (“DOA”) provided for reimbursement of allowable
          costs incurred by HDC including certain postretirement welfare costs, for
          as
          long as HDC operated the plant. After the contract was terminated at the
          end of
          1998, the Army has not contributed further to these costs. The Company
          continues
          to accrue and pay for the costs related to HDC retirees while pursuing
          extraordinary relief from the DOA for reimbursement of these and other
          previously expensed employee benefit costs. Given the uncertain outcome
          of
          discussions with the DOA, the Company will begin recognizing the impact
          of any
          reimbursement in the period settled by recording an unrecognized gain which
          will
          be amortized into earnings over a period of time.

A
          few of
          the Company's non-U.S. operations have supplemental health benefit plans
          for
          certain retirees, the cost of which is not significant to the
          Company.

During
          the second quarter 2004, the Company announced an amendment to its health
          and
          dental benefit plans such that future health and dental benefits to certain
          retirees will be fixed at a certain contribution amount, not to be increased.
          As
          a result, the Company remeasured these plans as of June 1, 2004 resulting
          in a
          reduction of the Company’s benefit obligation by approximately $240 million. The
          discount rate used at the time of the remeasurement was adjusted from 6.25
          percent at December 31, 2003 to 6.50 percent at June 1, 2004 based on increases
          in interest rates. The effect of this change is reflected in the results
          below.

An
          percent rate of increase in per capita cost of covered health care benefits
          is
          assumed for 2006. The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 5 percent
          for
          2009 and remain at that level thereafter. A 1 percent increase or decrease
          in
          health care trend would have had no material impact on the 2005 service
          and
          interest costs or the 2005 benefit obligation.

In
          May,
          2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") 106-2, providing final
          guidance on accounting for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
          and
          Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). Under the provisions of FSP 106-2,
          the
          Company determined that its health care plans were not actuarially equivalent
          to
          Medicare Part D. In January, 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
          Services released final regulations implementing the Act. The Company has
          determined that, although its plans are believed to be actuarially equivalent
          and eligible for certain subsidies under the most recent regulations,
          implementation of these regulations will have an immaterial impact on its
          overall financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and
          therefore
          are not reflected in the above amounts.

COMMITMENTS

Purchase
            Obligations and Lease Commitments

At
            December 31, 2005, the Company had various purchase obligations totaling
            approximately $1.7 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for
            materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
            The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment
            under
            cancelable, noncancelable, and month-to-month operating leases totaling
            approximately $208 million over a period of several years. Of the total
            lease
            commitments, approximately 15 percent relate to machinery and equipment,
            including computer and communications equipment and production equipment;
            approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space,
            storage facilities and land; and approximately 35 percent relate to railcars.
            Rental expense, net of sublease income, was approximately $64 million,
            $65
            million, and $64 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The

Accounts
            Receivable Securitization Program

In
            1999,
            the Company entered into an agreement that allows the Company to sell
            certain
            domestic accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program
            to a third
            party. The agreement permits the sale of undivided interests in domestic
            trade
            accounts receivable. Receivables sold to the third party totaled $200
            million at
            December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Undivided interests in designated
            receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to
            the
            purchased interest in the receivable pools. Average monthly proceeds
            from
            collections reinvested in the continuous sale program were approximately
            $292
            million and $268 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Guarantees

In
            November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”), “Guarantor’s
            Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
            Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” an interpretation of FASB Statements
            No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34.” FIN
            45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
            Contingencies,” relating to the guarantor’s accounting for, and disclosure of,
            the issuance of certain types of guarantees. Disclosures about each group
            of
            similar guarantees are provided below.


Residual
            Value Guarantees

If
            certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees
            a portion
            of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing
            of the
            related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees
            at
            December 31, 2005 totaled $85 million and consisted primarily of leases
            for
            railcars, company aircraft, and other equipment.

Leases
            with guarantee amounts totaling $4 million, $27 million, and $54 million
            will
            expire in 2006, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

The
            Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the
            likelihood
            of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote.

Other
            Guarantees

Guarantees
            and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships
            with suppliers, customers and non-consolidated affiliates when the Company
            undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified
            triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract could trigger
            an
            obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based
            upon
            alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental
            matters,
            and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results
            is
            not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty
            exists as
            to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities
            resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations
            in the
            period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material
            adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
            liquidity.

Product
            Warranty Liability

The
            Company warrants to the original purchaser of its products that it will
            repair
            or replace without charge products if they fail due to a manufacturing
            defect. However, the Company’s historical claims experience has not been
            material. The estimated product warranty liability for the Company's
            products as
            of December 31, 2005 is approximately $1 million. The Company accrues
            for
            product warranties when it is probable that customers will make claims
            under
            warranties relating to products that have been sold and a reasonable
            estimate of
            the costs can be made.

            Interest Entities

The
            Company has evaluated material relationships including the guarantees
            related to
            the third-party borrowings of joint ventures described above and has
            concluded
            that the entities are not Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) or, in the case of
            Primester, a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the
            Company's
            Kingsport, Tennessee plant, the Company is not the primary beneficiary
            of the
            VIE. As such, in accordance with

FASB

Interpretation
            Number 46,

Consolidation
            of Variable Interest Entities

("FIN
            46R"), the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. In
            addition,
            the Company has evaluated long-term purchase obligations with two entities
            that
            may be VIEs at December 31, 2005. These potential VIEs are joint ventures
            from
            which the Company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several
            years
            and purchases approximately $60 million of raw materials and utilities
            on an
            annual basis. The Company has no equity interest in these entities and
            has
            confirmed that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate
            the
            potential VIE. However, due to competitive and other reasons, the Company
            has
            not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine
            whether
            the entities are VIEs, and if one or both are VIEs, whether or not the
            Company
            is the primary beneficiary.

ENVIRONMENTAL
                        MATTERS

Certain
              Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes,
              the
              treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated
              by
              various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various
              hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities,
              has been
              designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP"), by the U.S. Environmental
              Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
              and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several
              liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be
              required to
              incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure
              under the
              federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Adequate reserves for
              environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with
              Eastman’s
              policies described in Note 1. Because of expected sharing of costs,
              the
              availability of legal defenses, and the Company’s preliminary assessment of
              actions that may be required, it does not believe its liability for
              these
              environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material
              to the
              Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
              The Company’s reserve for environmental contingencies was $51 million and $56
              million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing the
              minimum or
              best estimate for remediation costs and, for asset retirement obligation
              costs,
              the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets' estimated useful
              lives.
              Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range
              from the
              minimum or best estimate of $21 million to the maximum of $42 million
              at
              December 31, 2005 and the minimum or best estimate of $25 million to
              the maximum
              of $45 million at December 31, 2004.

LEGAL
                        MATTERS

General

From
              time
              to time, the Company and its operations are parties to, or targets
              of, lawsuits,
              claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability,
              personal
              injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
              environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters,
              which are
              being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While
              the Company
              is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe,
              based
              upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any
              such pending
              matters, including the sorbates litigation and the asbestos litigation
              described
              in the following paragraphs, will have a material adverse effect on
              its overall
              financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However,
              adverse
              developments could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in a particular
              future period.

Sorbates
              Litigation

Two
              civil
              cases relating to sorbates remain. The first is a case filed by a multi-state
              class of indirect purchasers seeking claimed damages, whose claims
              have been
              dismissed by Tennessee's trial court and that state's court of appeals.
              The
              Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims,
              and
              subsequently the trial court denied a motion to amend the complaint,
              ruling the
              case over. The Company believes an appeal of this determination is
              likely. The
              second is a case filed by New York's attorney general, also seeking
              claimed
              damages. The trial court has dismissed New York's claims, and the plaintiffs
              have filed a notice of appeal. Briefing on the state's appeal is not
              yet
              underway.

Asbestos
              Litigation

Over
              the
              years, Eastman has been named as a defendant, along with numerous other
              defendants, in lawsuits in various state courts in which plaintiffs
              alleged
              injury due to exposure to asbestos at Eastman’s manufacturing sites and sought
              unspecified monetary damages and other relief. Historically, these
              cases have
              been dismissed or settled without a material effect on Eastman’s financial
              condition, results of operations, or cash flows.


In
              recently filed cases, plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos-containing
              products
              allegedly made by Eastman. Based on its investigation to date, the
              Company has
              information that it manufactured limited amounts of an asbestos-containing
              plastic product between the mid-1960’s and the early 1970’s. The Company’s
              investigation has found no evidence that any of the plaintiffs worked
              with or
              around any such product alleged to have been manufactured by the Company.
              The
              Company intends to defend vigorously the approximately1,500 pending
              claims or to
              settle them on acceptable terms.

The
              Company has finalized an agreement with an insurer that issued primary
              general
              liability insurance to certain predecessors of the Company prior to
              the
              mid-1970's, pursuant to which that insurer will provide coverage for
              a portion
              of certain of the Company's defense costs and payments of settlements
              or
              judgments in connection with asbestos-related lawsuits.

Evaluation
              of the allegations and claims made in recent asbestos-related lawsuits
              continue
              to be reviewed by the Company. Based on such evaluation to date, the
              Company
              continues to believe that the ultimate resolution of asbestos cases
              will not
              have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of
              operations, or cash flows, although these matters could result in the
              Company
              being subject to monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against
              earnings in particular periods. To date, costs incurred by the Company
              related
              to the recent asbestos-related lawsuits have not been material.

              have

(2)

Includes
              cash dividends paid of $142 million and dividends declared but
              unpaid.

The
              Company is authorized to issue 400 million shares of all classes of
              stock, of
              which 50 million may be preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share,
              and 350
              million may be common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The Company
              declared
              dividends of $1.76 per share in each of 2005, 2004 and 2003.


The
              Company established a benefit security trust in 1997 to provide a degree
              of
              financial security for unfunded obligations under certain plans and
              contributed
              to the trust a warrant to purchase up to 1 million shares of common
              stock of the
              Company for par value. The warrant, which remains outstanding, is exercisable
              by
              the trustee if the Company does not meet certain funding obligations,
              which
              obligations would be triggered by certain occurrences, including a
              change in
              control or potential change in control, as defined, or failure by the
              Company to
              meet its payment obligations under covered unfunded plans. Such warrant
              is
              excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because
              the
              conditions upon which the warrant becomes exercisable have not been
              met.

The
              additions to paid-in capital for 2005 and 2004 are primarily the result
              of stock
              option exercises by employees. The additions to paid-in capital for
              primarily reflect the vesting of restricted stock.

The
              Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of
              its common
              stock. No shares of Eastman common stock were repurchased by the Company
              during
              2005, 2004, and 2003 under any publicly announced plan.

A
              total
              of 2,746,869 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $112
              million, or
              an average price of approximately $41 per share, have been repurchased
              under the
              authorization.

Repurchased
              shares may be used to meet common stock requirements for compensation
              and
              benefit plans and other corporate purposes.

The
              Company's charitable foundation held the following shares of the Company's
              common stock at December 31 2005, 2004 and 2003: 106,771 shares, 122,725
              shares
              and 144,825 shares, respectively.

For
              2005,
              2004, and 2003, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
              used to
              compute basic earnings per share was 80.7 million, 77.6 million, and
              77.1
              million, respectively, and for diluted earnings per share was 81.8
              million, 78.3
              million, and 77.1 million, respectively, reflecting the effect of dilutive
              options outstanding. Excluded from the 2005 calculation were shares
              underlying
              options to purchase 878,442 shares of common stock at a range of prices
              from
              $54.25 to $67.50, because the exercise price of the options was greater
              than the
              average market price of the underlying common shares. Excluded from
              the 2004
              calculation were shares underlying options to purchase 5,667,339 shares
              of
              common stock at a range of prices from $45.44 to $67.50, because the
              exercise
              price of the options was greater than the average market price of the
              underlying
              common shares. As a result of the net loss reported for 2003, common
              shares
              underlying options to purchase 10,338,100 shares of common stock at
              a range of
              prices from $29.90 to $73.94 have been excluded from the calculation
              of diluted
              earnings (loss) per share.

              adjustment is considered a component of permanently invested, unremitted

              substantially similar to and intended to replace the 1997 Omnibus Long-Term
              Compensation Plan (the "1997 Omnibus Plan"), which replaced the 1994
              Omnibus
              Long-Term Compensation Plan (the “1994 Omnibus Plan”), provides for grants to
              employees of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, tandem
              and
              freestanding stock appreciation rights (“SAR’s”), performance shares and various
              other stock and stock-based awards. Certain of these awards may be
              based on
              criteria relating to Eastman performance as established by the Compensation
              and
              Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors. No new
              awards have
              been made under the 1994 Omnibus Plan or the 1997 Omnibus Plan following
              the
              effectiveness of the 2002 Omnibus Plan. Outstanding grants and awards
              under the
              1994 Omnibus Plan or the 1997 Omnibus Plan are unaffected by the replacement
              of
              the 1997 Omnibus Plan (and 1994 Omnibus Plan) by the 2002 Omnibus Plan.
              The 2002
              Omnibus Plan provides that options can be granted through May 2, 2007,
              for the
              purchase of Eastman common stock at an option price not less than 100
              percent of
              the per share fair market value on the date of the stock option's grant.
              Substantially all grants awarded under the 1994 Omnibus Plan, the 1997
              Omnibus
              Plan, and the 2002 Omnibus Plan have been at option prices equal to
              the fair
              market value on the date of grant. Options typically vest in equal
              increments on
              either the first two or three anniversaries of the grant date and expire
              ten
              years after grant. There is a maximum of 7.5 million shares of common
              stock
              available for option grants and other awards during the term of the
              2002 Omnibus
              Plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock with respect to
              one or more
              options and/or SARs that may be granted during any one calendar year
              under the
              2002 Omnibus Plan to the Chief Executive Officer or to any of the next
              four most
              highly compensated executive officers (each a "Covered Employee") is
              300,000.
              The maximum fair market value of any awards (other than options and
              SARs) that
              may be received by a Covered Employee during any one calendar year
              under the
              2002 Omnibus Plan is the equivalent value of 200,000 shares of common
              stock as
              of the first business day of such calendar year.


Director
              Long-Term Compensation Plan

Eastman's
              2002 Director Long-Term Compensation Plan (the "2002 Director Plan"),
              which is
              substantially similar to and intended to replace the 1999 Director
              Long-Term
              Compensation Plan (the “1999 Director Plan”), which formerly replaced the 1994
              Director Long-Term Compensation Plan (the “1994 Director Plan”), provides for
              grants of nonqualified stock options and restricted shares to nonemployee
              members of the Board of Directors. No new awards have been made under
              the 1994
              Director Plan or the 1999 Director Plan, following the effectiveness
              of the 2002
              Director Plan. Outstanding grants and awards under the 1994 Director
              Plan or the
              1999 Director Plan are unaffected by the replacement of the 1999 Director
              Plan
              (and the 1994 Director Plan) with the 2002 Director Plan. Shares of
              restricted
              stock are granted upon the first

day
              of
              the directors' initial term of service and nonqualified stock options
              and shares
              of restricted stock are granted each year following the annual meeting
              of
              stockholders. The 2002 Director Plan provides that options can be granted
              through the later of May 1, 2007, or the date of the annual meeting
              of
              stockholders in 2007 for the purchase of Eastman common stock at an
              option price
              not less than the stock's fair market value on the date of the grant.
              The
              options vest in 50 percent increments on the first two anniversaries
              of the
              grant date and expire ten years after grant. The maximum number of
              shares of
              common stock that are available for grant of awards under the 2002
              Director Plan
              during its term is 200,000.

SFAS
              No.
              123 and SFAS No. 148 require that stock option awards be valued at
              fair value
              determined by market price, if actively traded in a public market or,
              if not,
              calculated using an option pricing financial model. The Company uses
              the
              Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which requires input of highly
              subjective assumptions. The assumptions used in the determination of
              fair value
              for stock options awarded in 2005, 2004 and 2003 are provided in the
              table

Because
              the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly
              different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
              subjective
              input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
              management's
              opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
              single
              measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

IMPAIRMENTS
                        AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES,
                        NET

Impairments
              and restructuring charges totaled $33 million during 2005, consisting
              of
              non-cash asset impairments of $12 million and restructuring charges
              of $21
              million.

Impairments
              and restructuring charges totaled $206 million during 2004, consisting
              of
              non-cash asset impairments of $140 million and restructuring charges
              of $66
              million.

Effective
              January 1, 2004, certain commodity product lines were transferred from
              the
              Performance Chemicals and Intermediates (“PCI”) segment to the CASPI segment,
              which resulted in the reclassification of asset impairment and severance
              charges
              of approximately $42 million for 2003.

              following table summarizes the 2005, 2004 and 2003 charges:

During
              2005, the Company recorded $33 million in restructuring charges. These
              charges
              consist of approximately $8 million of fixed asset impairments related
              to the
              Company's PCI manufacturing facilities outside the United States, $14
              million in
              restructuring charges related to the shutdown of Cendian Corporation
              ("Cendian"), the Company's logistics subsidiary, $4 million of fixed
              and
              intangible asset impairments related to the Company's DB segment, $3
              million in
              severance charges related to the separation of approximately 90 employees
              at the
              Company's Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility, and $4 million
              in site
              closure costs related to the previously announced closures of certain
              manufacturing facilities.


In
              the
              fourth quarter 2004, the Company recorded restructuring charges of
              approximately
              $18 million, consisting of asset impairments of $9 million and site
              closure and
              other restructuring charges of $9 million. The non-cash asset impairments
              relate
              to the adjustment to fair value of assets at Cendian, impacting the
              DB segment,
              resulting from a decision to reintegrate Cendian’s logistics activities. In
              addition, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $9 million
              primarily
              related to actual and expected severance of Cendian and other employees,
              as well
              as site closure charges primarily related to previously announced manufacturing
              plant closures.

In
              the
              third quarter 2004, the Company recognized restructuring charges of
              approximately $42 million, including asset impairments of approximately
              $28
              million, for assets at the Company’s Batesville, Arkansas and Longview, Texas
              manufacturing facilities. These impairments primarily related to certain
              fixed
              assets in the performance chemicals product lines in the PCI segment
              that
              management decided to rationalize due to increased foreign competition.
              Also in
              third quarter, the CASPI segment

incurred
              approximately $2 million in site closure charges primarily related
              to previously
              announced manufacturing plant closures, while the DB segment recognized
              approximately $4 million in severance and restructuring charges related
              to the
              reorganization of Cendian. Severance charges of $2 million, $3 million,
              $2
              million, and $1 million were also recognized in the CASPI, PCI, SP,
              and Polymers
              segments, respectively. These charges resulted from the Company's voluntary
              termination program as well as ongoing cost reduction efforts.

In
              the
              second quarter 2004, the Company recognized $79 million in restructuring
              charges, including asset impairments of $62 million related to assets
              held for
              sale. The assets were part of the Company’s sale of certain businesses and
              product lines within the CASPI segment, which was completed July 31,
              2004. Those
              product lines include: certain acrylic monomers; composites (unsaturated
              polyester resins); inks and graphic arts raw materials; liquid resins;
              powder
              resins; and textile chemicals. The charges reflect adjustment of the
              recorded
              values of these assets to the expected sales proceeds. Also in second
              quarter
              2004, the Company recognized an additional $4 million of site closure
              costs
              related primarily to previously announced manufacturing plant closures.
              These
              charges had an impact of approximately $2 million each to the CASPI
              and SP
              segments. Severance charges of $5 million, $4 million, $2 million,
              $1 million,
              and $1 million were also recognized in the CASPI, PCI, SP, Polymers,
              and DB
              segments, respectively. These charges resulted from the Company's voluntary
              termination program as well as ongoing cost reduction efforts.


In
              the
              first quarter 2004, the Company recognized $67 million in restructuring
              charges,
              including approximately $40 million of asset impairments and $5 million
              of
              severance charges primarily related to the closure of its copolyester
              manufacturing facility in Hartlepool, United Kingdom. The decision
              to close the
              Hartlepool site, which manufactured products that are within the Company’s SP
              segment’s product lines, was made in order to consolidate production at other
              sites to create a more integrated and efficient global manufacturing
              structure.
              Accordingly, the carrying value of the manufacturing fixed assets was
              written
              down to fair value as established by appraisal and available market
              data. In
              addition, the Company recognized $1 million of fixed asset impairments
              and $1
              million of site closure costs related to additional impairments within
              the CASPI
              reorganization and changes in estimates for previously accrued amounts.
              Severance charges of $4 million, $3 million, $1 million, $11 million,
              and $1
              million were also recognized in the CASPI, PCI, SP, Polymers, and DB
              segments,
              respectively, as a result of ongoing cost reduction efforts.


CASPI
              Segment

In
              the
              third quarter, the Company reorganized the operating structure within
              its CASPI
              segment and changed the segment’s business strategy in response to the financial
              performance of certain underlying product lines. Prior to the third
              quarter
              2003, management was pursuing growth strategies aimed at significantly
              improving
              the financial performance of these product groups. However, due to
              the continued
              operating losses and deteriorating market conditions, management decided
              to
              pursue alternative strategies including restructuring, divestiture,
              and
              consolidation. This change affected both the manner in which certain
              assets are
              used and the financial outlook for these product groups, thus triggering
              the
              impairments and certain restructuring charges.

The
              third
              quarter fixed asset impairment charges of approximately $234 million
              primarily
              related to assets associated with the above mentioned underperforming
              product
              lines, and primarily impacted manufacturing sites in the North American
              and
              European regions that were part of the Lawter International, Inc. (“Lawter”),
              McWhorter Technologies, Inc. (“McWhorter”), and Chemicke Zavody Sokolov
              (“Sokolov”) acquisitions. Within these product lines, nine sites in North
              America and six sites in Europe were impaired. As the undiscounted
              future cash
              flows could not support the carrying value of the assets, the fixed
              assets were
              written down to fair value, as established primarily by appraisal.

The
              third
              quarter intangible asset impairments charges related to definite-lived
              intangible assets of approximately $128 million and indefinite-lived
              intangibles
              of approximately $47 million. The definite-lived intangibles related
              primarily
              to developed technology and customer lists, and the indefinite-lived
              intangibles
              primarily related to trademarks. These intangible assets were primarily
              associated with the acquisitions of Lawter and McWhorter. As the undiscounted
              future cash flows could not support the carrying value of the definite-lived
              intangible assets, these assets were written down to fair value, as
              established
              primarily by appraisal. Indefinite-lived intangible assets were written
              down to
              fair value, as established by appraisal.


Upon
              adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," the
              Company
              defined “reporting units” as one level below the operating segment level and
              considered the criteria set forth in SFAS No. 142 in aggregating the
              reporting
              units. This resulted in the CASPI segment being deemed a single reporting
              unit.
              In the third quarter 2003, the reorganization of the operating structure
              within
              the CASPI segment resulted in new reporting units one level below the
              operating
              segment. Due to the change in strategy and lack of similar economic
              characteristics, these reporting units did not meet the criteria necessary
              for
              aggregation. As a result, the goodwill associated with the CASPI segment
              was
              reassigned to the new reporting units based upon relative fair values.
              The
              reporting unit that contained the above-mentioned product lines was
              assigned $34
              million of goodwill out of the total CASPI segment goodwill of $333
              million.
              Because the Company determined that this reporting unit could no longer
              support
              the carrying value of its assigned goodwill, the full amount of that
              goodwill
              was impaired. The fair value of the other reporting unit within CASPI
              was
              sufficient to support the carrying value of the remainder of the goodwill.

In
              the
              fourth quarter, the Company recognized fixed asset impairments and
              site closure
              costs of $1 million and $3 million, respectively. The fixed asset impairments
              relate to additional impairments associated with the CASPI reorganization,
              as
              discussed above. The site closure charges relate primarily to additional
              costs
              related to the closure of the Company’s Dusseldorf manufacturing site.

Other
              Segments

In
              the
              second quarter, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of
              approximately
              $15 million related to the impairment of certain fixed assets used
              in certain of
              the PCI segment’s performance chemicals product lines that are located in
              Llangefni, Wales. In response to industry conditions, during the second
              quarter
              2003 the Company revised its strategy and the earnings forecast for
              the products
              manufactured by these assets. As the undiscounted future cash flows
              could not
              support the carrying value of the assets, the fixed assets were written
              down to
              fair value, as established primarily by discounted future cash flows
              of the
              impacted assets.

In
              the
              third and fourth quarter, the PCI segment incurred charges of $40 million
              related to the impairment of fixed assets used in performance chemicals
              product
              lines as a result of increased competition and changes in business
              strategy in
              response to a change in market conditions and the financial performance
              of these
              product lines. Within the specialty organic chemicals product lines,
              the fixed
              asset impairments charge related to assets located at the Kingsport,
              Tennessee
              facility.

In
              the
              fourth quarter 2003, an asset impairment charge of $1 million was recorded
              related to certain research and development assets classified as held
              for sale.
              The fair value of these assets was determined using the estimated proceeds
              from
              sale less cost to sell. These charges impacted the Polymers segment.

During
              2003, the Company recognized $20 million in severance costs for the
              actual and
              probable employee separations from consolidation and restructuring
              activities in
              the CASPI segment and ongoing cost reduction efforts throughout the
              Company.
              These changes are reflected in CASPI, PCI, SP, Polymers, and Fibers
              segments of
              $15 million, $2 million, $1 million, $1 million, and $1 million,
              respectively.


The
              following table summarizes the charges and changes in estimates described
              above,
              other asset impairments and restructuring charges, the non-cash reductions
              attributable to asset impairments, and the cash reductions in shutdown
              reserves
              for severance costs and site closure costs paid:

Actual
              and probable involuntary separations totaled approximately 90 employees
              during
              2005. As of the end of 2005, substantially all separations accrued
              for were

During
              2003, terminations related to actual and probable involuntary separations
              totaled approximately 500 employees. As of the end of 2003, approximately
              350 of
              these terminations had occurred, with the remaining primarily relating
              to
              previously announced consolidation and restructuring activities of
              certain
              European CASPI manufacturing sites that were completed in early 2004.

The
              effective tax rate was impacted by a $11 million tax charge resulting
              from the
              repatriation of $321 million of foreign earnings and capital pursuant
              to
              provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("Jobs Act").
              The Jobs Act
              created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
              income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received
              deduction for
              certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.

The
              effective tax rate was impacted by $90 million of deferred tax benefits
              resulting from the expected utilization of a capital loss resulting
              from the
              sale of certain businesses and product lines and related assets in
              the CASPI
              segment and $26 million of tax benefit resulting from the favorable
              resolution
              of a prior year capital loss refund claim.


The
              significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities
              follow:

Unremitted
              earnings of subsidiaries outside the United States, considered to be
              reinvested
              indefinitely, totaled $305 million at December 31, 2005. It is not
              practicable
              to determine the deferred tax liability for temporary differences related
              to
              those unremitted earnings.

For
              certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, income and losses directly
              flow
              through to taxable income in the United States. These entities are
              also subject
              to taxation in the foreign tax jurisdictions. Net operating loss carryforwards
              exist to offset future taxable income in foreign tax jurisdictions
              and valuation
              allowances are provided to reduce deferred related tax assets if it
              is more
              likely than not that this benefit will not be realized. Changes in
              the estimated
              realizable amount of deferred tax assets associated with net operating
              losses
              for these entities could result in changes in the deferred tax asset
              valuation
              allowance in the foreign tax jurisdiction. At the same time, because
              these
              entities are also subject to tax in the United States, a deferred tax
              liability
              for the expected future taxable income will be established concurrently.
              Therefore, the impact of any reversal of valuation allowances on consolidated
              income tax expense will only be to the extent that there are differences
              between
              the United States statutory tax rate and the tax rate in the foreign
              jurisdiction. A valuation allowance of $89 million at December 31,
              2005, has
              been provided against the deferred tax asset resulting from these operating
              loss
              carryforwards.

At
              December 31, 2005, foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaled
              $408
              million. Of this total, $92 million will expire in 3 to 15 years; and
              $316
              million will never expire.

SEGMENT
                        INFORMATION

The
              Company’s products and operations are managed and reported in three divisions
              comprising six operating segments. Eastman Division consists of the
              CASPI
              segment, the PCI segment, and the SP segment. Voridian Division contains
              the
              Polymers segment and the Fibers segment. The Developing Businesses
              Division
              consists of the DB segment.

For
              and 2004, the Company’s divisional structure provided for goods and services to
              be transferred between the divisions at predetermined prices that may have
              been in excess of cost. Accordingly, the divisional structure resulted in
              the recognition of interdivisional sales revenue and operating earnings.
              Such
              interdivisional transactions are eliminated in the Company’s consolidated
              financial statements.

The
              CASPI
              segment manufactures raw materials, additives and specialty polymers,
              primarily
              for the paints and coatings, inks, and adhesives markets. The CASPI
              segment's
              products consist of liquid vehicles, coatings additives, and hydrocarbon
              resins
              and rosins and rosin esters. Liquid vehicles, such as ester, ketone
              and alcohol
              solvents, maintain the binders in liquid form for ease of application.
              Coatings
              additives, such as cellulosic polymers,

Texanol

ester
              alcohol and chlorinated polyolefins, enhance the rheological, film
              formation and
              adhesion properties of paints, coatings and inks. Hydrocarbon resins
              and rosins
              and rosin esters are used in adhesive, ink, and polymers compounding
              applications. Additional products are developed in response to, or
              in
              anticipation of, new applications where the Company believes significant
              value
              can be achieved. On July 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of
              certain
              businesses, product lines and related assets within the CASPI segment.
              The
              divested businesses and product lines were composites (unsaturated
              polyester
              resins), certain acrylic monomers, inks and graphic arts raw materials,
              liquid
              resins, powder resins, and textile chemicals.


The
              PCI
              segment manufactures diversified products that are used in a variety
              of markets
              and industrial and consumer applications, including chemicals for agricultural
              intermediates, fibers, food and beverage ingredients, photographic
              chemicals,
              pharmaceutical intermediates, polymer compounding and chemical manufacturing
              intermediates. The PCI segment also offers custom manufacturing services
              through
              its custom synthesis business.

The
              SP
              segment’s key products include engineering and specialty polymers, specialty
              film and sheet products, and packaging film and fiber products. Included
              in
              these are highly specialized copolyesters and cellulosic plastics that
              possess
              unique performance properties for value-added end uses such as appliances,
              store
              fixtures and displays, building and construction, electronic packaging,
              medical
              packaging, personal care and cosmetics, performance films, tape and
              labels,
              fiber, photographic and optical film, graphic arts, and general
              packaging.

The
              Polymers segment manufactures and supplies PET polymers for use primarily
              in
              beverage and food packaging, including carbonated soft drinks, water,
              juices,
              sports drinks, beer and food containers that are suitable for both
              conventional
              and microwave oven use. The Polymers segment also manufactures low-density
              polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene, which are used primarily
              in
              extrusion coating, film and molding applications.

The
              Fibers segment manufactures

Estron

acetate
              tow and

Estrobond

triacetin plasticizers which are used primarily in cigarette filters;

Estron

and

Chromspun

acetate
              yarns for use in apparel, home furnishings and industrial fabrics;
              acetate flake
              for use by other acetate tow producers; and acetyl chemicals.

The
              DB
              segment includes new businesses and certain investments in growth opportunities
              that leverage the Company’s technology expertise, intellectual property and
              know-how into business models that extend to new customers and markets.
              The
              segment includes Centrus, a business in food safety diagnostics; and
              Eastman’s
              gasification services. The DB segment also includes the results of
              Cendian,
              which was shutdown in 2005 and Ariel, which was sold in fourth quarter
              2004.

RECENTLY
                        ISSUED ACCOUNTING
                        STANDARDS

In
              November, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of
              Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4”. The standard adopts the
              International Accounting Standards Board’s view related to inventories that
              abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded
              from the
              cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. Additionally, the Statement
              clarifies the meaning of the term 'normal capacity'. The provisions
              of this
              Statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal
              years
              beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has evaluated the effect
              of SFAS No.
              151 and determined that it does not materially impact its consolidated
              financial
              position, liquidity, or results from operations.

In
              December, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised), “Share-Based Payment.”
SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25- Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
              SFAS No. 123(R) requires all companies that award their employees stock-based
              compensation to recognize these transactions in their financial statements
              based
              on the grant-date fair value of the award. This differs from the requirements
              of
              SFAS No. 123 which permitted the option of adopting SFAS No. 123 and
              reflecting
              these transactions in the financial statements or the continued application
              of
              APB Opinion No. 25 requiring only pro forma disclosure of the effects
              on net
              earnings and earnings per share as if SFAS No. 123 had been adopted.
              Through the
              end of 2005, the Company has elected to continue application of APB
              Opinion No.
              25 with the pro forma disclosure required for SFAS No. 123. However,
              the Company
              is required to implement the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) effective
              January 1,
              2006.

SFAS
              No.
              123(R) requires the Company, as of the required effective date of application,
              to implement the standard using a modified version of prospective application.
              Under this method, compensation expense is recognized for the following:
              1) the
              portion of outstanding awards at the effective date of implementation
              for which
              the requisite employee service has not yet been rendered, based upon
              the
              grant-date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS No. 123
              for pro
              forma disclosure purposes, and 2) all new awards, modified awards,
              repurchased
              awards, or cancelled awards after the effective date of
              implementation.

Under
              previous reporting guidance, the following types of share-based compensation
              awards have been recorded in the financial statements: 1) unrestricted
              common
              stock awards, 2) restricted common stock awards, 3) stock appreciation
              rights
              payable in cash and 4) long-term performance awards payable in the
              form of
              shares of common stock or cash. The implementation of SFAS No. 123(R)
              includes
              the additional requirement to recognize compensation expense of stock
              option
              awards in the financial statements. The outstanding quantity and value
              of
              existing stock option awards at December 31, 2005 for which the requisite
              service period has not been provided and for which compensation expense
              will be
              recognized in the financial statements after the effective date of
              application
              total 1,990,617 options and approximately $17 million over three years.
              The
              Company did not modify any awards granted prior to January 1, 2006
              to affect
              early vesting which would have eliminated the required service period
              to be
              provided after the effective date of application and eliminated recognition
              of
              compensation expense related thereto. Further, there have not been
              any changes
              in the quantity or type of share-based payment awards solely due to
              the
              implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).


The
              determination of the grant-date fair value of share-based compensation
              awards is
              based upon observable prices of financial equity instruments actively
              traded in
              open markets or, if not available, as in the case of the Company's
              stock option
              awards and stock appreciation rights awards, an option pricing financial
              model
              should be used to estimate the fair value of the award. Eastman has
              relied upon
              the use of the Black-Scholes-Merton model to determine the value of
              its stock
              options and stock appreciation rights under SFAS No. 123 and will continue
              to do
              so under SFAS No. 123(R). As discussed in Note 15

to the
              Company’s consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2005
              Annual Report on Form 10-K.,

the use
              of any financial model may require the use of highly subjective input
              assumptions that may materially affect the fair value estimate. Refer
              to this
              footnote to review these assumptions for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

All
              share-based employee compensation expense will be reflected in the
              earnings
              statement within the selling, general and administrative expense line
              item with
              an offset to paid-in-capital or non-current liabilities in the statement
              of
              financial position dependent upon classification as a liability award
              or equity
              award. Awards classified as liabilities require the use of cash or
              other assets
              to effect payment while equity awards reflect payment through stock
              issuances.
              The federal income tax and state income tax consequences of recognition
              for
              share-based compensation are reflected in the earnings statement as
              a credit to
              current period income tax expense with an offset in the statement of
              financial
              position as deferred income taxes in the other non-current assets line
              item.
              Additionally, SFAS No. 123(R) requires that cash inflows related to
              the realized
              tax benefits in excess of the amount recorded in the financial statements
              be
              recognized in the statement of cash flows as a cash inflow from financing
              and a
              cash outflow from operating activities.

                        TAX

SFAS
              No. 143

Effective
              January 1, 2003, the Company’s method of accounting for environmental
              closure and postclosure costs changed as a result of the adoption of
              SFAS
              No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” Upon the initial
              adoption of the provision, entities are required to recognize a liability
              for
              any existing asset retirement obligations adjusted for cumulative accretion
              to
              the date of adoption of this Statement, an asset retirement cost capitalized
              as
              an increase to the carrying amount of the associated long-lived asset,
              and
              accumulated depreciation on that capitalized cost. In accordance with
              SFAS No.
              143, the Company

recorded
              asset retirement obligations primarily related to closure and postclosure
              environmental liabilities associated with certain property plant and
              equipment.
              This resulted in the Company recording asset retirement obligations
              of $28
              million and an after-tax credit to earnings of $3 million.

If
              the
              asset retirement obligation measurement and recognition provisions
              of SFAS No.
              143 had been in effect on January 1, 2002, the aggregate carrying amount
              of
              those obligations on that date would have been $27 million. If the
              amortization
              of asset retirement cost and accretion of asset retirement obligation
              provisions
              of SFAS No. 143 had been in effect during 2002, the impact on “Earnings before
              cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle” would have been
              immaterial.

Disclosure
              Controls and Procedures

The
              Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed
              to ensure
              that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports
              that it
              files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
              processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
              in
              Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. An evaluation was
              carried
              out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's
              management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief
              Financial
              Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
              procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded
              that the
              Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December
              31,
              2005.

Management’s
              Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management
              of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
              internal
              control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial
              reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s principal
              executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance
              regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
              of the
              Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.
              generally accepted accounting principles.

The
              Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
              procedures that:

Pertain
              to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
              and fairly
              reflect transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company;

Provide
              reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
              permit
              preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
              accepted
              accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
              are
              being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
              the
              directors of the Company; and

Provide
              reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
              acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
              material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Management
              has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
              reporting
              as of December 31, 2005 based on the framework established in

Internal
              Control - Integrated Framework

issued
              by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
              (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s
              internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December
              31,
              2005.

Management’s
              assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
              reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
              LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
              their report
              which appears herein.

Changes
              in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There
              has
              been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
              occurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 that has materially affected,
              or is
              reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
              financial reporting.
