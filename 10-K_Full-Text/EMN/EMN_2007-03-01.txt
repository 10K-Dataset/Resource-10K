BUSINESS

CORPORATE
      OVERVIEW

Eastman
      Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company") is a global chemical company
      which
      manufactures and sells a broad portfolio of chemicals, plastics, and fibers.
      Eastman began business in 1920 for the purpose of producing chemicals for
      Eastman Kodak Company's photographic business and became a public company,
      incorporated in Delaware, as of December 31, 1993. Eastman has 16 manufacturing
      sites in 10 countries that supply chemicals, plastics, and fibers products
      to
      customers throughout the world. The Company's headquarters and largest
      manufacturing site are located in Kingsport, Tennessee.

In
      2006,
      the Company had sales revenue of $7.5 billion, operating earnings of $640
      million, and net earnings of $409 million. Earnings per diluted share were
      $4.91
      in 2006. Included in 2006 operating earnings were accelerated depreciation
      related to restructuring decisions of $10 million, asset impairments and
      restructuring charges of $101 million and other operating income of $68 million.

The
      Company’s products and operations are managed and reported in five operating
      segments: the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers, and Inks ("CASPI")
      segment, the Fibers segment, the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI")
      segment, the Performance Polymers segment and the Specialty Plastics ("SP")
      segment. A segment is determined primarily by the customer markets in which
      it
      sells its products and services. For additional information related to the
      Company’s operating segments, see Note 21 "Segment Information" to the Company’s
      consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report
      on Form 10K.

In
      addition to the segments, the Company manages certain costs and initiatives
      at
      the corporate level including certain research and development costs not
      allocated to any one operating segment. Coal gasification, including chemicals
      from coal, is one of the more significant of these corporate
      initiatives.

Eastman's
      management believes that the Company is well-positioned for sustained success
      both in the near-term and the long-term. Eastman's objective is to leverage
      its
      heritage of expertise and innovation in acetyl, polyester, and olefins
      chemistries to drive growth, meet increasing demand and create new opportunities
      for the Company's products in key markets.

·

The
                Company expects continued strong and steady financial performance
                from its
                solid base of businesses in the Fibers, CASPI and SP segments, and
                growth
                of the SP segment's business through introduction by Eastman of a
                new
                family of copolyesters to be commercially available by the end of
                2007.

·

Through
                innovation and strategic actions, Eastman expects to substantially
                improve
                the profitability of its polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") polymers
                business by the second half of
                2008.

·

By
                leveraging its expertise in coal gasification, Eastman expects over
                time
                to increase the volume of products derived from coal as a raw material
                to
                approximately 50 percent, from approximately 20 percent, thereby
                providing
                the Company with a significant cost advantage.

To
      better
      focus on its core strengths, the Company divested a portion of its product
      portfolio in the fourth quarter 2006.

The
      Company sold its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets
      in the PCI segment and its polyethylene ("PE") related assets in the Performance
      Polymers and CASPI segments. In 2006, these divested product lines had sales
      revenue of $811 million and operating earnings of $124 million.


Manufacturing
      Streams

As
      stated
      above, Eastman's objective is to leverage its heritage of expertise and
      innovation in acetyl, polyester, and olefins chemistries to drive growth in
      key
      markets including packaging, tobacco, durable goods, building and construction,
      and others. For each of these chemistries, Eastman has developed a combination
      of assets and technologies that are operated within three manufacturing
      "streams".

·

In
                the acetyl stream, the Company begins with high sulfur coal which
                is then
                gasified in its coal gasification facility. The resulting synthesis
                gas is
                converted into a number of chemicals including methanol, methyl acetate,
                acetic acid and acetic anhydride. These chemicals are used in products
                throughout the Company including acetate tow, acetate yarn and cellulose
                esters. The Company's ability to use coal is a competitive advantage
                for
                raw materials and energy. The Company is investigating opportunities
                to
                further leverage its coal-based process know-how in a corporate initiative
                referred to as "chemicals from coal", with the objective of increasing
                product volume derived from coal gasification-based raw materials
                versus
                crude oil to enable Eastman to achieve lower, more stable costs.

·

In
                the polyester stream, the Company begins with purchased paraxylene
                and
                produces purified terephthalic acid ("PTA") and dimethyl terephthalate
                ("DMT") while most of its polyester competitors start with PTA and
                DMT.
                The Company also purchases PTA for use at some of its facilities
                outside
                the U.S. PTA or DMT is then reacted with ethylene glycol, which the
                Company both makes and purchases, along with other raw materials
                (some of
                which the Company makes and are proprietary) to produce PET and
                copolyesters. This backward integration of its polyester manufacturing
                provides several competitive advantages. For PET, this gives Eastman
                a
                cost advantage in a commodity market. For copolyester, Eastman adds
                a
                specialty monomer to provide clear, tough, chemically resistant product
                characteristics. As a result, the Company's copolyesters can compete
                with
                materials such as polycarbonate and acrylic.

·

In
                the olefins stream, the Company begins primarily with propane and
                ethane,
                which are then cracked at its facility in Longview, Texas into propylene
                and ethylene. The company also purchases propylene for use at its
                facilities outside the U.S. The propylene is used in oxo derivative
                products, while the ethylene is used in oxo derivatives, acetaldehyde
                and
                ethylene glycol production and also sold to external
                markets.

                displays

Cyclicality
      and Seasonality

Certain
      segments, particularly the PCI and Performance Polymers segments, are impacted
      by the cyclicality of key products and markets, while other segments are more
      sensitive to global economic conditions. Supply and demand dynamics determine
      profitability at different stages of cycles and global economic conditions
      affect the length of each cycle. Despite some sensitivity to global economic
      conditions, many of the products in the Fibers, CASPI and SP segments provide
      a
      more stable foundation of earnings.

The
      Company's earnings and cash flows also typically have some seasonal
      characteristics. The Company's earnings are typically greater in the second
      and
      third quarters, while cash from operations is usually greater in the fourth
      quarter. Demand for CASPI segment products is typically stronger in the second
      and third quarters due to the increased use of coatings products in the building
      and construction industries, while demand is typically weaker during the winter
      months because of seasonal construction downturns. The PCI segment typically
      has
      a weaker fourth quarter, due in part to a seasonal downturn in demand for
      products used in certain building and construction and agricultural markets.
      The
      Performance Polymers segment typically has stronger demand for its PET polymers
      for beverage container plastics during the second and early third quarters
      due
      to higher consumption of beverages in the Northern hemisphere, while demand
      typically weakens during the late third and fourth quarters.


CASPI
      SEGMENT

·

Overview

The
      CASPI
      segment manufactures liquid vehicles, additives, specialty polymers, and other
      raw materials which are integral to the production of paints and coatings,
      inks,
      adhesives, and other formulated products. The CASPI segment focuses on producing
      raw materials rather than finished products in order to develop long-term,
      strategic relationships and achieve preferred supplier status with its
      customers. Growth in these markets in North America and Europe typically
      approximates economic growth in general, due to the wide variety of end uses
      for
      these applications and dependence on the economic conditions of the markets
      for
      durable goods, packaged goods, automobiles, and housing. However, higher growth
      sub-markets exist within North America and Europe, driven by customers' growing
      demands for performance requirements that are protective of the environment
      and
      meet increasingly stringent government regulation. For example, the coatings
      and
      adhesives industries are promoting products and technologies designed to reduce
      air emissions. Growth in Asia and Latin America is substantially higher than
      general economic growth, driven primarily by the increasing government
      regulations in industrializing economies.

In
      2006,
      the CASPI segment had sales revenue of $1.4 billion, which represented 19
      percent of Eastman’s total sales. In fourth quarter 2006, the Company sold the
      CASPI segment's

Epolene

polymer
      businesses and related assets in conjunction with the sale of the polyethylene
      business. Product lines associated with the divestiture had sales revenue of
      $65
      million in 2006.

·

Products

Ø

Coatings
                Additives, Coalescents and
                Solvents

The
      additives product lines consist of differentiated and proprietary products,
      including cellulosic polymers which enhance the aesthetic appeal and improve
      the
      performance of industrial and automotive original equipment and refinish
      coatings and inks. Coalescents include products such as

Texanol

ester
      alcohol which improves film formation and durability in architectural latex
      paints, and chlorinated polyolefins which promote the adherence of paints and
      coatings to plastic substrates. Solvents, which consist of ester, ketone, glycol
      ether and alcohol solvents, are used in both paints and inks to maintain the
      formulation in liquid form for ease of application. Environmental regulations
      that impose limits on the emission of volatile organic compounds and hazardous
      air pollutants continue to impact coatings formulations requiring compliant
      coatings raw materials. Eastman’s coatings additives, coalescents and solvents
      are currently used in compliant coatings. Additional products are under
      development to meet the growing demand for waterborne and high solids coatings.
      Coatings additives, coalescents and solvents comprised 60 percent of the CASPI
      segment’s total sales for 2006.

Ø

Adhesives
                Raw Materials

The
      adhesives product lines consist of hydrocarbon resins, rosin resins, resin
      dispersions, and polymer raw materials. These products are sold to adhesive
      formulators and tape and label manufacturers for use as raw materials in hot
      melt and pressure sensitive adhesives and as binders in nonwoven products such
      as disposable diapers, feminine products, and pre-saturated wipes. Eastman
      is
      one of the largest manufacturers of hydrogenated gum rosins used in adhesive
      and
      chewing gum applications. Eastman offers the broadest product portfolio of
      raw
      materials for the adhesives industry, ranking as the second largest global
      tackifier supplier. Adhesives raw materials comprised 40 percent of the CASPI
      segment’s total sales for 2006.

The
      profitability of the CASPI segment products is sensitive to the global economy,
      exchange rates, market trends and broader chemical cycles, particularly the
      olefins cycle. The CASPI segment's specialty products, which include coatings
      additives, coalescents, and selected hydrocarbon resins, are less sensitive
      to
      the olefins cycle due to their functional performance attributes. The cyclical
      commodity products, which include commodity solvents and polymer raw materials,
      are impacted by the olefins cycle. The Company leverages its proprietary
      technologies, competitive cost structure and integrated manufacturing facilities
      to maintain a strong competitive position throughout such cycles.


·

Strategy
                and Innovation

A
      key
      element of the CASPI segment growth strategy is the continued development of
      innovative product offerings, building on proprietary technologies in
      high-growth markets and regions that meet customers’ evolving needs and improve
      the quality and performance of customers’ end products. Management believes that
      its ability to leverage the CASPI segment's broad product line and Eastman's
      research and development capabilities makes it uniquely capable of offering
      a
      broad array of solutions for new and emerging markets. The Company is pursuing
      high value incremental expansions of existing CASPI manufacturing assets to
      ensure that adequate capacity is available to meet the increasing demand for
      the
      segment's differentiated products.

The
      CASPI
      segment is focused on the expansion of the coatings and inks additives and
      specialty solvents product offerings into other high-growth areas. These include
      market areas with growth due to specific market trends and product developments,
      such as high solids and water-based coatings and inks, as well as growth in
      geographic areas due to the level and timing of industrial development. The
      Company's global manufacturing presence positions the CASPI segment to take
      advantage of areas of high industrial growth, particularly in Asia from its
      facility in Singapore and joint venture operations in China.

The
      CASPI
      segment is also focused on the expansion of the adhesives raw materials product
      offerings into high-growth markets and regions by leveraging applications
      technology and increasing production capacity. The segment expects to take
      advantage of growth in demand for specialty hydrocarbon resins through the
      percent expansion of the Company's hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing
      capacity in Middelburg, the Netherlands, completed in the fourth quarter 2006,
      and through the 30 percent expansion of hydrocarbon resin production capacity
      at
      Eastman's joint venture operation in Nanjing, China, completed in the second
      quarter 2006. Additionally, the CASPI segment has increased profitability within
      this group of product lines through cost reduction initiatives and leveraging
      of

Customers
                and Markets

As
      a
      result of the variety of end uses for its products, the customer base for the
      CASPI segment is broad and diverse. This segment has more than 1,250 customers
      around the world, and approximately 80 percent of its sales revenue in 2006
      was
      attributable to approximately 90 customers. The CASPI segment focuses on
      establishing long-term, customer service-oriented relationships with its
      strategic customers in order to become their preferred supplier and to leverage
      these relationships to pursue sales opportunities in previously underserved

      time
      to time, customers decide to develop products internally or diversify their
      sources of supply that had been provided by Eastman's CASPI segment. Growth
      in
      North American and European markets typically coincides with economic growth
      in
      general, due to the wide variety of end uses for these applications and their
      dependence on the economic conditions of the markets for durable goods, packaged
      goods, automobiles, and housing.

Competition

Competition
      within the CASPI segment's markets varies widely depending on the specific
      product or product group. Because of the depth and breadth of its product
      offerings, Eastman does not believe any one of its competitors presently offers
      all the products it manufactures within the CASPI segment. The Company’s major
      competitors in the CASPI segment's markets include larger companies such as
      Dow
      Chemical Company ("Dow"), BASF and Exxon Mobil Corporation, which may have
      greater financial and other resources than Eastman. Additionally, within each
      CASPI segment product market the Company competes with other smaller, regionally
      focused companies that may have advantages based upon location, local market
      knowledge, manufacturing strength in a specific product, or other similar
      factors. However, Eastman does not believe that any of its competitors has
      a
      dominant position within the CASPI segment's markets. The Company believes its
      competitive advantages include its level of vertical integration, breadth of
      product and technology offerings, low-cost manufacturing position, consistent
      product quality, and process and market knowledge. In addition, Eastman attempts
      to leverage its strong customer base and long-standing customer relationships
      to
      promote substantial recurring business, further strengthening its competitive
      position.

PCI
      SEGMENT

·

Overview

The
      Company’s PCI segment manufactures diversified products that are sold
      externally, as well as used internally by other segments. The PCI segment's
      earnings are highly dependent on how the Company chooses to optimize the acetyls
      stream and the olefins stream. In 2006, the PCI segment had sales revenue of
      $1.7 billion, which represented 22 percent of Eastman’s total sales.

In
      fourth
      quarter 2006, Eastman sold its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility
      and
      related assets and the specialty organic chemicals product lines in the PCI
      segment. Product lines associated with the divestiture had revenue of $111
      million in 2006. In addition, as part of the sale of the Performance Polymers
      segment's polyethylene business, the Company has agreed to supply ethylene
      to
      the buyer. These sales of ethylene, which was previously used internally, will
      be reported in the PCI segment. The company also expects to begin a staged
      phase-out of older cracking units in 2007, with timing dependent in part on
      market conditions.

·

Products

The
      PCI
      segment offers over 135 products that include intermediates based on oxo and
      acetyl chemistries, and performance chemicals. The PCI segment's 2006 sales
      revenue was approximately 55 percent olefin-based, 15 percent acetyl-based,
      percent polymer-based, and 25 percent based on performance and other chemicals.

Approximately
      73 percent of the PCI segment's sales revenue is generated in North America.
      Sales in all regions are generated through a mix of the Company’s direct sales
      force and a network of distributors. The Company's PCI segment is the largest
      marketer of acetic anhydride in the United States, an intermediate that is
      a
      critical component of analgesics and other pharmaceutical and agricultural
      products, and is the only U.S. producer of acetaldehyde, a key intermediate
      in
      the production of vitamins and other specialty products. Eastman manufactures
      one of the world's broadest ranges of products derived from oxo aldehydes.
      The
      PCI segment’s other intermediate products include plasticizers and glycols. Many
      of the intermediates products in the PCI segment are priced based on supply
      and
      demand of substitute and competing products. In order to maintain a competitive
      position, the Company strives to operate with a low cost manufacturing base.

The
      PCI
      segment also manufactures performance chemicals, that are complex organic
      molecules such as diketene derivatives, specialty ketones, and specialty
      anhydrides for pharmaceutical, fiber, and food and beverage ingredients, which
      are typically used in specialty market applications. These specialty products
      are typically priced based on the amount of value added rather than supply
      and
      demand factors.


·

Strategy
                and Innovation

To
      build
      on and maintain its status as a low cost producer, the PCI segment continuously
      focuses on cost control, operational efficiency, and capacity utilization to
      maximize earnings. Through the PCI segment, the Company maximizes the advantage
      of its highly integrated and world-scale manufacturing facilities.

For
      example, the Kingsport, Tennessee manufacturing facilities allow the PCI segment
      to produce acetic anhydride and other acetyl derivatives from coal rather than
      natural gas or other petroleum feedstocks. At the Longview, Texas facility,
      Eastman's PCI segment uses its proprietary oxo-technology in the world’s largest
      single-site, oxo aldehyde manufacturing facility to produce a wide range of
      alcohols, esters, and other derivative products utilizing propane and local
      ethane supplies, as well as purchased propylene. These integrated facilities,
      combined with large scale production processes and a continuous focus on
      additional process improvements, allow the PCI segment to remain cost
      competitive with, and for some products cost-advantaged over, its competitors.

The
      PCI
      segment selectively focuses on continuing to develop and access markets with
      high-growth potential for the Company’s chemicals. The Company engages in
      customer-focused research and development initiatives in order to develop new
      PCI products and find additional applications for existing products. The Company
      is currently focusing these efforts on applications in the personal care market
      and markets using plasticizers.

·

Customers
                and Markets

The
      PCI
      segment’s products are used in a variety of markets and end uses, including
      agrochemical, automotive, beverages, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, coatings,
      flooring, medical devices, toys, photographic and imaging, household products,
      polymers, textiles, and industrials. The markets for products with market-based
      pricing in the PCI segment are cyclical. This cyclicality is caused by periods
      of supply and demand imbalance, either when incremental capacity additions
      are
      not offset by corresponding increases in demand, or when demand exceeds existing
      supply. Demand, in turn, is based on general economic conditions, raw material
      and energy prices, consumer demand and other factors beyond the Company’s
      control. Eastman may be unable to increase or maintain the PCI segment's gross
      margins in periods of economic stagnation or downturn, and future PCI segment
      results may fluctuate from period to period due to these economic conditions.
      The Company believes many of these markets are being positively affected by
      the
      current olefins upcycle. However, the strength of product-specific olefin
      derivative markets will vary widely based upon prevailing supply and demand
      conditions.

An
      important trend within the PCI segment's markets is a tendency toward increased
      regionalization of key markets, especially for acetyls and olefins products,
      due
      to increased transportation costs. Additionally, the PCI segment is engaged
      in
      continuous efforts directed toward optimizing product and customer mix.
      Approximately 80 percent of the PCI segment’s sales revenue in 2006 was from 100
      out of approximately 1,200 customers worldwide.

·

Competition

Historically,
      there have been significant barriers to entry for competitors with respect
      to a
      majority of the PCI segment's products, primarily due to the fact that the
      relevant technology has been held by a small number of companies. As this
      technology has become more readily available, competition from multinational
      chemical manufacturers has intensified. Eastman competes with these and other
      producers primarily based on price, as products are interchangeable, but also
      on
      technology, marketing and services. Eastman’s major competitors in this segment
      include large multinational companies such as Dow, Celanese, BASF, and Exxon
      Mobil Corporation. While some competitors in PCI's product markets may have
      greater financial resources than Eastman, the Company believes it maintains
      a
      strong competitive position due to the combination of its scale of operations,
      breadth of product line, level of integration, and technology leadership.


PERFORMANCE
      POLYMERS SEGMENT

·

Overview

In
      2006,
      the Performance Polymers segment had revenues of $2.6 billion, which represented
      36 percent of the Company’s total sales. The segment consisted of two principal
      product lines, PET and PE.

In
      fourth
      quarter 2006, Eastman concluded the sale of its PE business. The PE product
      lines were manufactured entirely in the United States and had a relatively
      small
      market share. The low density polyethylene and linear low density polyethylene
      product lines of the PE business accounted for approximately 25 percent of
      the
      Performance Polymers segment’s sales revenue in 2006.

The
      PET
      product line competes to a large degree on price in a capital intensive
      industry. Profitability is achieved by attaining low cost positions through
      technology innovation, manufacturing scale, capacity utilization, access to
      reliable and competitive utilities, energy and raw materials, efficient
      manufacturing processes and distribution.

The
      Company's PET production is vertically integrated back to the raw material
      paraxylene for a substantial majority of its capacity. The Performance Polymers
      segment's PET product line for the packaging market is the world’s largest based
      on capacity share; the most global based on manufacturing sites; and the
      broadest based on formula diversity. PET is used in a wide variety of packaging
      products including those for carbonated soft drinks, water, juice, personal
      care
      items, household cleaners, beer and food containers. The Performance Polymers
      segment has PET manufacturing sites in the United States, Mexico, Argentina,
      Spain, England, and the Netherlands. The Performance Polymers segment competes
      primarily in North America, Latin America, and Europe.

In
      2007,
      the Company will transform the Performance Polymers segment.  Through
      innovation and strategic actions, Eastman expects to substantially improve
      the
      operating margin of its PET polymers business to approximately 10 percent by
      the
      second half of 2008.  Through the Company's new facility utilizing

IntegRex

technology in South Carolina, the Company expects to increase PET production
      through a combination of new capacity and debottlenecking, partially offset
      by
      rationalization of higher cost assets.  The new facility using

IntegRex

technology will be in full operation in the first quarter of 2007, resulting
      in
      33 percent of the Company's North American PET capacity being

IntegRex-

based
      capacity.  The segment is also taking strategic actions to address
      under-performing PET assets outside the U.S, including entering into an
      agreement to sell the San Roque, Spain manufacturing facility. 
Additionally, the Performance Polymers segment is evaluating the possible
      construction of a second

PET
      manufacturing facility fully utilizing

IntegRex

technology.

      revenue in 2006. These customers are primarily PET container suppliers to large
      volume beverage markets such as carbonated soft drinks, water, and juice, with
      strong participation in custom areas such as food, liquor, sport and fruit
      beverages, health and beauty aids, and household products. In 2006, the
      worldwide market for PET, including containers, film and sheet, was
      approximately 11 million metric tons. Demand for PET has grown steadily over
      the
      past several years, driven by its popularity for recyclable, single-serve
      containers and as a substitute for glass and aluminum. PET has already made
      significant inroads in soft drink and water bottles, and producers are currently
      targeting markets such as hot-fill soups and sauces and containers for beer.
      Industry analysts report that PET consumption grew worldwide from 1.0 million
      metric tons in 1989 to approximately 11 million metric tons in 2006, a compound
      annual growth rate of 15 percent. Global demand for PET is expected to grow
      approximately 6 to 8 percent annually over the next several years.

Competition

Major
      competitors for the Performance Polymers segment include DAK Americas,
      Equipolymers, Far Eastern Textiles Ltd., Invista, Mossi & Ghisolfi Group,
      Nan Ya Plastics Corporation, Reliance Industries Ltd., and Wellman Inc.

The
      strong growth in demand for PET, coupled with ease of access to conventional
      manufacturing technology, has resulted in the presence of over 100 significant
      resin producers in this market in 2006, up from fewer than 20 in 1995. The
      Performance Polymers segment is a global competitor with manufacturing sites
      in
      North America, Latin America and Western Europe. The level of competition,
      however, varies by region. Competition is primarily on the basis of price with
      product performance, quality, service, and reliability also being competitive
      factors.

Industry
      pricing is strongly affected by raw material costs and capacity utilization.
      PET
      global supply has exceeded demand since 1997 as a result of capacity being
      introduced into the market at a rate exceeding that of demand growth. While
      the
      demand for PET continues to increase steadily, excess capacity, particularly
      in
      Asia, remains. Excess Asian capacity and related exports are expected to
      continue to have an adverse impact on PET pricing worldwide.

SP
      SEGMENT

·

Overview

The
      SP
      segment produces highly specialized copolyesters and cellulosic plastics that
      possess differentiated performance properties for value-added end uses such
      as
      appliances, store fixtures and displays, building and construction, electronic
      packaging, medical devices and packaging, graphic arts, general purpose
      packaging, personal care and cosmetics packaging, food and beverage packaging,
      performance films, tape and labels, fibers/nonwovens, photographic and optical
      films, and liquid crystal displays. In 2006, the SP segment had sales revenue
      of
      $818 million, which represented just over 11 percent of Eastman’s total
      sales.

The
      SP
      segment competes in the market for plastics that meet specific performance
      criteria, typically determined on an application-by-application basis. Product
      development in the SP segment is dependent upon Eastman’s ability to design
      plastics products that achieve performance characteristics specified by its
      customers, while providing a better value proposition than alternative materials
      such as polycarbonate and acrylic. Increases in market share are gained through
      the development of new applications, substitution of plastic for other
      materials, and, displacement of other plastic resins in existing applications.
      The SP segment produces polyesters, specialty copolyesters, cellulose esters,
      and cellulosic plastics. The Company estimates that the market growth for
      copolyesters will continue to be higher than general economic growth due to
      continued material innovations and displacement opportunities. Eastman believes
      that cellulosic materials will grow at the growth rate of the economy in
      general, driven by the strong demand for cellulose esters in liquid crystal
      displays more than offsetting the decline in legacy photographic
      markets.


Eastman’s
      specialty copolyesters, which generally are based on Eastman's market leading
      supply of cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM") modified polymers, typically fill
      a
      market position between polycarbonates and acrylics. Polycarbonates
      traditionally have had some superior performance characteristics, while acrylics
      have been less expensive. Specialty copolyesters combine superior performance
      with competitive pricing and are being substituted for both polycarbonates
      and
      acrylics based on their relative performance and pricing.

The
      SP
      segment also includes cellulosic materials, which have historically been a
      steady business with strong operating margins for the Company, and includes
      what
      Eastman believes is a market-leading position in North American cellulose esters
      for tape and film products and cellulose plastics for molding applications.
      Eastman has recently commercialized a new family of materials,

Visualize

cellulose
      esters, for the liquid crystal displays market.

Eastman
      has the ability within its SP segment to modify its polymers and plastics to
      control and customize their final properties, creating numerous opportunities
      for new application development, including the expertise to develop new
      materials and new applications starting from the molecular level in the research
      laboratory to the final designed application in the customer’s plant. In
      addition, the SP segment has a long history of manufacturing excellence with
      strong process improvement programs providing continuing cost reduction.
      Manufacturing process models and information technology systems support global
      manufacturing sites and provide monitoring and information transfer capability
      that speed up the innovation process.

Products

Ø

Engineering
                and Specialty Polymers

Engineering
      and specialty polymers accounted for approximately 50 percent of the SP
      segment’s 2006 sales revenue. These polymers include a broad line of polyesters,
      copolyesters, alloys, cellulose flake, and cellulosic plastics that are sold
      to
      a diverse and highly fragmented customer base in numerous market segments on
      a
      global basis. Sales in all regions are generated through a mix of the Company’s
      direct sales force and a network of distributors. Engineering and specialty
      polymers products are sold into three sectors: durable goods (principally
      components used in appliances); medical goods (disposable medical devices,
      health care equipment and instruments, and pharmaceutical packaging); and
      personal care and consumer goods (housewares, cosmetics, eyewear, tools, toys,
      and food and beverage packaging).

Engineering
      and specialty polymers products are heavily specification-driven. The Company
      works with OEM companies to enable product designers to use polymers for a
      specified use in their products. Although the average life cycle of many of
      these products is shrinking over time, the Company works to identify uses for
      the polymers in products that will have multi-year lives. In working with OEM
      companies on new consumer product designs, new polymer products are often
      developed for use in a particular type of end-use product.

Ø

Specialty
                Film and Sheet

Sales
      of
      specialty film and sheet products represented approximately 30 percent of the
      SP
      segment’s 2006 revenue. The key end-use markets for specialty film and sheet are
      packaging and in-store fixtures and displays. Direct customers are film and
      sheet producers, but marketing activities focus downstream through designers,
      specifiers, OEMs and brand owners in targeted end-use markets.

In
      the
      packaging market, specialty film and sheet is sold to end-use markets including
      medical and electronic component trays, shrink label films, general purpose
      packaging, and multilayer films. Eastman continues to innovate materials
      solutions for the packaging market which include high melt strength copolyesters
      for handleware applications and modified copolyesters used to produce shrink
      packaging labels. Competitive materials in these end-use markets are typically
      PET polymers, high density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") and oriented
      polystyrene. Eastman’s primary brands for these markets are

Eastar

and

Embrace

copolyesters.

In
      the
      in-store fixture and display market,

Spectar

copolyester is marketed primarily for point of purchase displays including
      indoor sign and store fixtures.

Eastar

copolyester is marketed into the graphics market. Copolyester use in these
      end-use markets is expected to grow above display market rates as a result
      of
      new business growth. Competitive materials in these end-use markets are
      polymethylmethacrylate and polycarbonate.


Ø

Optical
                Films and Fibers

Packaging,
      film and fiber products, which represented approximately 20 percent of the
      SP
      segment’s 2006 revenue, include a range of specialty polymer products for
      markets such as photographic film, optical film, fibers/nonwovens, tapes/labels
      and liquid crystal displays. Customers are typically manufacturers of film
      and
      fiber products, employing a range of processing technologies, including film
      melt extrusion, solvent casting, and fiber extrusion. These films and fibers
      products are further converted to produce value-added products, such as
      photographic film, liquid crystal displays film, adhesive tape, or nonwoven
      articles, which are sold as branded items. Products include cellulose esters,
      copolyesters, specialty polyesters and concentrates/additives. Sales of products
      that are used as raw materials in traditional photographic markets continue
      to
      be under pressure due to the conversion of traditional photographic technology
      to digital imaging. The SP segment has commercialized a new family of materials,

Visualize

cellulose
      esters, for the liquid crystal displays market.

·

Strategy
                and Innovation

The
      SP
      segment is focused on delivering consistent gross margins and reinvesting for
      continued growth. Over the past three years, the SP segment has divested certain
      non-core businesses, shut-down certain non-integrated manufacturing operations,
      and expanded certain integrated facilities. The Company continues to leverage
      the advantages of being an integrated polyester manufacturer and will continue
      to pursue opportunities within the integrated polyester stream. The SP segment
      is taking advantage of the opportunity to utilize rationalized PET assets to
      reduce copolyester conversion costs and enhance its ability to market its
      products against competitive materials. This opportunity is expected to capture
      the synergies of the Performance Polymers segment's integrated structure and
      the
      SP segment's ability to develop higher value markets. These synergies should
      enable the SP segment to reduce costs and expand production, increase the scale
      necessary to substitute for competitive materials, and focus on targeted growth
      markets. The SP segment continues to pursue growth by investing in marketing,
      research and development, and manufacturing to meet the needs of the global
      marketplace. For example, the segment is beginning a capital project to increase
      copolyester capacity at Eastman's South Carolina site in order to meet expected
      growth in global demand. The SP segment is also expanding its Kingsport-based
      CHDM capacity to provide additional intermediates to support global market
      growth for copolyester products. The SP segment is also investigating options
      to
      increase capacity for its cellulose ester products to support continued demand
      in key markets such as liquid crystal displays.

Eastman
      has a broad portfolio of key monomers that can be combined in various ways
      to
      yield a range of polymers with widely varying properties for different
      applications. Development of proprietary technology is currently underway to
      enable the SP segment to produce a new family of products that would allow
      entry
      into applications that have been beyond the reach of the current portfolio
      of
      copolyester products. This new copolyester innovation is expected to offer
      a
      combination of chemical and temperature resistance that should enable the SP
      segment to create new material solutions in markets and applications that the
      SP
      segment's current copolyesters have insufficient properties to meet. These
      new
      applications are estimated to represent 1.5 billion pounds of opportunities
      in
      markets such as medical, building and construction, durables and personal care.
      The SP segment anticipates having commercial product available for these new
      applications by the end of 2007.

The
      Company competes in market niches requiring polymers with combinations of
      clarity, toughness, and chemical resistance. The liquid crystal display market
      is a developing growth market for the SP segment. The Company is investing
      in
      the development of copolyester and cellulosic based product solutions for this
      high-growth market, with the objective of becoming a strategic raw material
      supplier in the liquid crystal displays market. The SP segment's management
      anticipates continued strong growth of

Visualize

cellulose
      esters.

The
      SP
      segment develops product enhancements in order to respond to specific market
      needs, and expects this to result in increased market penetration for existing
      products. Likewise, the introduction of new products will provide access to
      previously underserved markets. In addition, the SP segment is focusing on
      global growth by investing resources to provide product solutions to customers
      in previously underserved regional markets. The SP segment model of innovation
      leverages a unique and growing portfolio of cellulosics and specialty
      copolyesters, such as

Visualize

cellulose
      esters for liquid crystal displays,

Embrace

copolyesters for shrink films, and

Eastar

copolyesters for cosmetics packaging and clear handleware containers.


The
      Company is a major supplier of resins to the specialty film and sheet markets.
      With Eastman serving less than 10 percent of the global specialty film and
      sheet
      end-use markets, substantial growth opportunities exist for Eastman. The growth
      strategy is to penetrate new market segments or geographies and offer a
      substitute for other materials by providing an improved value proposal or design
      flexibility that enhances the growth potential of the Company’s customers. One
      example is Eastman's technology for Encapsulated Image Layer Technology
      ("EILT"). EILT deploys patented technology that allows licensees to construct
      decorative laminate sheeting using Eastman copolyesters for high value
      architectural design applications.

·

Customers
                and Markets

The
      customer base in the SP segment is broad and diverse, consisting of over 700
      companies worldwide in a variety of industries. Approximately 80 percent of
      the
      SP segment’s 2006 revenue was attributable to approximately 70 customers. The SP
      segment seeks to develop mutually beneficial relationships with its customers
      throughout various stages of product life cycles. By doing so, it is better
      able
      to understand its customers’ needs as those customers develop new products, and
      more effectively bring new solutions to market.

·

Competition

Competition
      in the SP segment varies as a function of where the products are in their life
      cycle. For example, the SP segment's products in the introduction phase of
      the
      life cycle compete mainly on the basis of performance. As products begin to
      advance in the life cycle, and substitute products come into existence, the
      basis of competition begins to shift, taking into account factors such as price,
      customer service, and brand loyalty. At maturity, where one or more competitors
      may have equivalent products in the market, competition is based primarily
      on
      price. Many large, well-recognized manufacturers produce substitute products
      of
      different materials, some of which may offer better performance characteristics
      than those of the Company's products, and others of which may be offered at
      a
      lower price.

The
      SP
      segment has a full array of products moving across the life cycle as described
      above. For example, two commonly used plastics materials in the heavy gauge
      sheet market are acrylic and polycarbonate. In general, acrylics are lower
      in
      cost, while polycarbonates provide higher performance at a higher cost.
      Eastman’s products capture portions of both markets. Customers of the SP segment
      can select from products that offer improved performance over acrylics at a
      slightly higher cost, or products that are lower cost than polycarbonates while
      still possessing excellent performance properties. In this way, the SP segment
      is able to meet the industry need for low-cost, high performance plastics
      materials and maintain a significant advantage over its competitors. With regard
      to engineering and specialty polymers products, the Company competes in market
      areas requiring polymers with combinations of clarity, toughness, and chemical
      resistance. Eastman’s primary competitors for engineering and specialty polymers
      are companies such as Bayer AG, Lanxess AG, Dow, GE Plastics, Nova Chemicals
      Corporation and others, including polycarbonate, acrylic and clear acrylonitrile
      butadiene styrene producers in regions outside North America. Specialty film
      and
      sheet competitors also include polymer companies, such as GE Plastics, Bayer
      AG,
      Dow, Cyro Industries, Ineos, Atoglas, SK Chemical Industries, and Selenis,
      which
      sell copolyesters, polycarbonate, acrylic, and/or polyvinyl chloride resins.
      Competition for packaging, film and fiber products is primarily from other
      producers of polyester and producers of cellulose ester polymers such as Acetati
      SpA and Daicel. Competition with other polymers such as acrylic, PVC,
      polystyrene, polypropylene and polycarbonate is also significant in several
      markets and applications. Channels to customers include corporate accounts,
      direct sales, e-commerce, and distributors.

The
      SP
      segment believes that it maintains competitive advantages over its competitors
      throughout the product life cycle. At product introduction, the segment’s
      breadth of offerings combined with its research and development capabilities
      and
      customer service orientation enable it to quickly bring a wide variety of
      products to market. As products enter the growth phase of the life cycle, the
      SP
      segment is able to continue to leverage its product breadth by receiving
      revenues from multiple sources, as well as retaining customers from long-term
      relationships. As products become price sensitive, the SP segment can take
      advantage of Eastman's scale of operations and vertical integration to maintain
      a superior product conversion cost position.


The
      SP
      segment believes it has competitive advantages in copolyester and cellulose
      esters plastics. However, new competitors have begun selling copolyester
      products in the past few years. These new competitors cannot yet produce the
      wide variety of specialty copolyesters offered by the SP segment or offer the
      same level of technical assistance. Additionally, the Company is committed
      to
      investing for growth in SP product lines to support continued market growth
      and
      maintaining the cost advantages obtained from its scale of operations and
      manufacturing expertise. There can be no assurance, however, that the SP segment
      will be able to maintain this competitive advantage and if it is unable to
      do
      so, its results of operations could be adversely affected.

EASTMAN
      CHEMICAL COMPANY GENERAL INFORMATION

Sales,
      Marketing, and Distribution

The
      Company markets products primarily through a global sales organization, which
      has a presence in the United States and in over 35 other countries around the
      world. Eastman has a number of broad product lines which require a sales and
      marketing strategy that is tailored to specific customers in order to deliver
      high quality products and high levels of service to all of its customers
      worldwide. Technical expertise and process knowledge are critical in determining
      the application of products for a particular customer. Through a highly skilled
      and specialized sales force that is capable of providing customized business
      solutions for each of its five operating segments, Eastman is able to establish
      long-term customer relationships and strives to become the preferred supplier
      of
      specialty chemicals and plastics.

The
      Company's products are marketed through a variety of selling channels, with
      the
      majority of sales being direct and the balance sold primarily through indirect
      channels such as distributors. Non-U.S. sales tend to be made more frequently
      through distributors than U.S. sales. The Company's customers throughout the
      world have the choice of obtaining products and services through Eastman's
      website,

www.eastman.com

,
      through
      any of its global customer service centers, or through any of Eastman's direct
      sales force or independent distributors. Customers who choose to use the
      Company’s website can conduct a wide range of business transactions such as
      ordering online, accessing account and order status, and obtaining product
      and
      technical data. Eastman is an industry leader in the implementation and
      utilization of e-business technology for marketing and selling products to
      customers and was one of the first chemical companies to offer this capability.
      Eastman views this as an opportunity to increase supply chain efficiency by
      having an enterprise resource-planning platform with connectivity to customers.
      These sales and marketing capabilities combine to reduce costs and provide
      a
      platform for growth opportunities for the Company by providing potential
      customers new methods to access Eastman’s products.

The
      Company’s products are shipped to customers directly from Eastman's
      manufacturing plants as well as from distribution centers worldwide, with the
      method of shipment generally determined by the customer.

Sources
      and Availability of Raw Materials and Energy

Eastman
      purchases a substantial portion, estimated to be approximately 80 percent,
      of
      its key raw materials and energy through long-term contracts, generally of
      three
      to five years initial duration with renewal or cancellation options for each
      party. Most of those agreements do not require the Company to purchase materials
      or energy if its operations are reduced or idle. The cost of raw materials
      and
      energy is generally based on market price at the time of purchase, although
      derivative financial instruments, valued at quoted market prices, have been
      utilized to mitigate the impact of short-term market price fluctuations. Key
      raw
      materials and purchased energy include propane, ethane, paraxylene, ethylene
      glycol, PTA, natural gas, coal, cellulose, methanol, electricity, and a wide
      variety of precursors for specialty organic chemicals. The Company has multiple
      suppliers for most key raw materials and energy and uses quality management
      principles, such as the establishment of long-term relationships with suppliers
      and on-going performance assessment and benchmarking, as part of the supplier
      selection process. When appropriate, the Company purchases raw materials from
      a
      single source supplier to maximize quality and cost improvements, and has
      developed contingency plans that would minimize the impact of any supply
      disruptions from single source suppliers.


While
      temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur, these
      items are generally sufficiently available to cover current and projected
      requirements. However, their continuous availability and price are subject
      to
      unscheduled plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, or
      due
      to domestic or world market and political conditions, changes in government
      regulation, natural disasters, war or other outbreak of hostilities. Eastman’s
      operations or products have been in the past and may be in the future, at times,
      adversely affected by these factors. The Company’s cost of raw materials and
      energy as a percent of total cost of operations was estimated to be
      approximately 70 percent for 2006, compared with 65 percent in 2005 and 55
      percent in 2004.

Capital
      Expenditures

Capital
      expenditures were $389 million, $343 million, and $248 million for 2006, 2005
      and 2004, respectively. The Company expects that 2007 capital spending will
      be
      up to $450 million which will exceed estimated 2007 depreciation and
      amortization of approximately $350 million, including accelerated depreciation
      of approximately $50 million, as it funds targeted growth efforts.

Employees

Eastman
      employs approximately 11,000 men and women worldwide. Approximately 7 percent
      of
      the total worldwide labor force is represented by unions, mostly outside the
      United States.

Customers

Eastman
      has an extensive customer base and, while it is not dependent on any one
      customer, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the Company
      until
      such business is replaced. The top 100 customers accounted for approximately
      percent of the Company's 2006 sales revenue.

Intellectual
      Property and Trademarks

While
      the
      Company’s intellectual property portfolio is an important Company asset which it
      expands and vigorously protects globally through a combination of patents that
      expire at various times, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, neither
      its
      business as a whole nor any particular segment is materially dependent upon
      any
      one particular patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret. As a producer
      of a
      broad and diverse portfolio of both specialty and commodity chemicals, plastics,
      and fibers, Eastman owns over 850 active United States patents and more than
      1,500 active foreign patents, expiring at various times over several years,
      and
      also owns over 3,000 active worldwide trademarks. The Company’s intellectual
      property relates to a wide variety of products and processes. With two recent
      significant research and development innovations, Eastman continues to actively
      protect its intellectual property. In support of the development of the

IntegRex

technology, the Company has filed over 140 patent applications. In support
      of
      the development of the copolyester innovation products, the Company has filed
      over 50 patent applications. Eastman can not assure that a patent will be
      granted from every application filed. As the laws of many foreign countries
      do
      not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United
      States, Eastman cannot assure that it will be able to adequately protect its
      intellectual property assets.

Research
      and Development

For
      2006,
      2005 and 2004, Eastman’s research and development expenses totaled $167 million,
      $162 million and $154 million, respectively. Research and development expenses
      are expected to decrease slightly in 2007 due to divestitures, partially offset
      by increased spending on growth initiatives.

Environmental

Eastman
      is subject to laws, regulations, and legal requirements relating to the use,
      storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal
      and
      remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and
      wastes in all of the countries in which it does business. These health, safety
      and environmental considerations are a priority in the Company’s planning for
      all existing and new products and processes. The Health, Safety, Environmental
      and Security Committee of Eastman’s Board of Directors reviews the Company's
      policies and practices concerning health, safety and the environment and its
      processes for complying with related laws and regulations, and monitors related
      matters.


The
      Company’s policy is to operate its plants and facilities in a manner that
      protects the environment and the health and safety of its employees and the
      public. The Company intends to continue to make expenditures for environmental
      protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with its policies
      and
      with the technology available. In some cases, applicable environmental
      regulations such as those adopted under the U.S. Clean Air Act and Resource
      Conservation and Recovery Act, and related actions of regulatory agencies,
      determine the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by the
      Company.

The
      Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the Company has
      incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In some
      instances, the amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to insufficient data,
      particularly in the nature and timing of the future performance. In these cases,
      the liability is monitored until such time that sufficient data exists. With
      respect to a contaminated site, the amount accrued

reflects
      the Company’s assumptions about remedial requirements at the site, the nature of
      the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other
      potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and
      financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the
      estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement
      action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control
      regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher or lower
      costs.

The
      Company's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement
      were estimated to be approximately $215 million, $198 million and $184 million
      in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts pertain primarily to
      operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and
      facilities, but also include expenditures for construction and development.
      The
      Company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from
      requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to
      materially increase the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures
      for environmental control facilities.

Other
      matters concerning health, safety, and the environment are discussed in
      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations in Part II Item 7 and in Notes 1, "Significant Accounting Policies",
      and 12, "Environmental Matters", to the Company’s consolidated financial
      statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form
      10-K.

Backlog

On
      January 1, 2007, Eastman’s backlog of firm sales orders was estimated to be
      approximately $290 million compared with approximately $295 million at January
      1, 2006. All orders are expected to be filled in 2007. The Company manages
      its
      inventory levels to control the backlog of products depending on customers'
      needs. In areas where the Company is the single source of supply, or competitive
      forces or customers' needs dictate, the Company may carry additional inventory
      to meet customer requirements.

PROPERTIES

PROPERTIES

At
      December 31, 2006, Eastman operated 16 manufacturing sites in 10 countries.
      Utilization of these facilities may vary with product mix and economic,
      seasonal, and other business conditions, but, except as indicated below, none
      of
      the principal plants are substantially idle. The Company's plants, including
      approved expansions, generally have sufficient capacity for existing needs
      and
      expected near-term growth. These plants are generally well maintained, in good
      operating condition, and suitable and adequate for their use. Unless otherwise
      indicated, all of the properties are owned. The locations and general character
      of the major manufacturing facilities are:

this
      manufacturing site.

In
      addition, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in Primester, a joint venture that
      manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastman's Kingsport, Tennessee plant. The
      production of cellulose acetate is an intermediate step in the manufacture
      of
      acetate tow and other cellulose acetate based products. The Company also has
      a
      50 percent interest in a manufacturing facility in Nanjing, China. The Nanjing
      facility produces

Eastotac

hydrocarbon tackifying resins for pressure-sensitive adhesives, caulks, and
      sealants.

Eastotac

hydrocarbon resins are also used to produce hot melt adhesives for packaging
      applications in addition to glue sticks, tapes, labels, and other adhesive
      applications.

Eastman
      has distribution facilities at all of its plant sites. In addition, the Company
      owns or leases over 100 stand-alone distribution facilities in the United States
      and 17 other countries. Corporate headquarters are in Kingsport, Tennessee.

      Annual Report on Form 10K.


ITEM
      3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

General

From
      time
      to time, the Company and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits,
      claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal
      injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
      environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which
      are
      being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the Company
      is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based
      upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending
      matters, including the sorbates litigation and the asbestos litigation
      (described below), will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial
      condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, adverse developments
      could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in a particular future period.

Sorbates
      Litigation

Two
      civil
      cases relating to sorbates remain. In each case, the Company prevailed at the
      trial court, and in each case, the plaintiff appealed the trial court's
      decision. In one case, the appeal is still pending. In the other case, the
      court
      of appeals overturned the trial court's decision and ruled that the plaintiff
      could amend and re-file its complaint with the trial court. The Company has
      appealed this court of appeals decision to the state supreme court. In each
      case
      the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.

Asbestos
      Litigation

Over
      the
      years, Eastman has been named as a defendant, along with numerous other
      defendants, in lawsuits in various state courts in which plaintiffs have alleged
      injury due to exposure to asbestos at Eastman’s manufacturing sites. More
      recently, certain plaintiffs have claimed exposure to an asbestos-containing
      plastic, which Eastman manufactured in limited amounts between the mid-1960’s
      and the early 1970’s.

To
      date,
      the Company has obtained dismissals or settlements of its asbestos-related
      lawsuits with no material effect on its financial condition, results of
      operations or cash flows, and over the past several years, has substantially
      reduced its number of pending asbestos-related claims. The Company has also
      obtained insurance coverage that applies to a portion of certain of the
      Company’s defense costs and payments of settlements or judgments in connection
      with asbestos-related lawsuits.

Based
      on
      an ongoing evaluation, the Company believes that the resolution of its pending
      asbestos claims will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
      condition, results of operations, or cash flows, although these matters could
      result in the Company being subject to monetary damages, costs or expenses,
      and
      charges against earnings in particular periods.

Middelburg
      (Netherlands) Environmental Proceeding

In
      June
      2005, Eastman Chemical Middelburg, B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
      Company, (the "Subsidiary") received a summons from the Middelburg (Netherlands)
      District Court Office to appear before the economic magistrate of that District
      and respond to allegations that the Subsidiary's manufacturing facility in
      Middelburg has exceeded certain conditions in the permit that allows the
      facility to discharge wastewater into the municipal wastewater treatment system.
      The summons proposed penalties in excess of $100,000 as a result of the alleged
      violations. A hearing in this matter took place on July 28, 2005, at which
      time
      the magistrate bifurcated the proceeding into two phases: a compliance phase
      and
      an economic benefit phase. With respect to the compliance phase, the magistrate
      levied a fine of less than $100,000. With respect to the economic benefit phase,
      where the prosecutor proposed a penalty in excess of $100,000, the district
      court in November 2006 assessed against the Subsidiary a penalty of less than
      $100,000. The prosecutor has appealed this ruling, and the appeal is pending.
      This disclosure is made pursuant to SEC Regulation S-K, Item 103, Instruction
      5.C., which requires disclosure of administrative proceedings commenced under
      environmental laws that involve governmental authorities as parties and
      potential monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000. The Company believes
      that the ultimate resolution of this proceeding will not have a
      material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or
      cash flows.


Jefferson
      (Pennsylvania) Environmental Proceeding

In
      December 2005, Eastman Chemical Resins, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
      the
      Company (the "ECR Subsidiary"), received a Notice of Violation ("NOV") from
      the
      United States Environmental Protection Agency's Region III Office ("EPA")
      alleging that the ECR Subsidiary's West Elizabeth, Jefferson Borough, Allegheny
      County, Pennsylvania manufacturing operation (the "Jefferson Facility") violated
      certain federally enforceable local air quality regulations and certain
      provisions in a number of air quality-related permits. The NOV did not assess
      a
      civil penalty and EPA has to date not proposed any specific civil penalty
      amount. In October 2006, EPA referred the matter to the United States Department
      of Justice's Environmental Enforcement Section ("DOJ"). Company representatives
      met with EPA and DOJ in November, 2006 and subsequent to that meeting the
      Company determined that it is not reasonably likely that any civil penalty
      assessed by the EPA and DOJ will be less than $100,000. While the Company
      intends to vigorously defend against these allegations, this disclosure is
      made
      pursuant to

SEC
      Regulation S-K, Item 103, Instruction 5.C.

,
      which
      requires disclosure of administrative proceedings commenced under environmental
      laws that involve governmental authorities as parties and potential monetary
      sanctions in excess of $100,000. The Company believes that the ultimate
      resolution of this proceeding will not have a material impact on the Company's
      financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, there were 83,637,623 shares of the Company's common stock
      issued and outstanding, which shares were held by 29,190 stockholders of record.
      These shares include 106,771 shares held by the Company's charitable foundation.
      The Company has declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per share during the first
      quarter of 2007. Quarterly dividends on common stock, if declared by the
      Company's Board of Directors, are usually paid on or about the first business
      day of the month following the end of each quarter. The payment of dividends
      is
      a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time based
      on
      the Company's earnings, financial position and prospects, and such other
      considerations as the Board considers relevant. Accordingly, while management
      currently expects that the Company will continue to pay the quarterly cash

The
                Company was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 4, 1999
                to
                repurchase up to $400 million of its common stock. Common share
                repurchases under this authorization in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were
                $51
                million, $57 million and $4 million, respectively. The Company has
                not
                repurchased any common shares under this authorization after 2001.

On
                February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors cancelled its prior
                authorization for stock repurchases dated February 4, 1999 and approved
                a
                new authorization for the repurchase of up to $300 million of the
                Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts,
                and on
                such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company.
                Repurchased shares may be used for such purposes or otherwise applied
                in
                such a manner as determined to be in the best interests of the Company.

This
      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements for Eastman
      Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company"), which have been prepared in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
      and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial
      statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All references
      to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share
      unless otherwise noted.


MANAGEMENT'S
      DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
      AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL
      ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In
      preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company’s management
      must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related
      disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting
      principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and
      judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
      and
      expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
      on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related
      to
      allowances for doubtful accounts, impaired assets, environmental costs, U.S.
      pension and other post-employment benefits, litigation and contingent
      liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical
      experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
      under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
      judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
      readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
      estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company’s management
      believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important
      to the fair presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results. These
      policies require management’s more significant judgments and estimates in the
      preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Allowances
      for Doubtful Accounts

The
      Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
      resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The
      Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual
      write-offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per share
      is low. However, if one of the Company’s key customers were to file for
      bankruptcy, or otherwise be unable to make its required payments, or there
      was a
      significant continued slowdown in the economy, the Company could be forced
      to
      increase its allowances. This could result in a material charge to earnings.
      For
      trade receivables of $698 million and $595 million at December 31, 2006 and
      2005, respectively, the Company’s allowances were $16 million and $20 million,
      respectively.

Impairment
      of Long-Lived Assets

The
      Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including
      definite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances
      indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and
      circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the
      market value of the asset, adverse change in the extent or manner in which
      the
      asset is being used, significant changes in business climate, or current or
      projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets. The carrying
      value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected
      undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less
      than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount
      by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset.
      For
      long-lived assets to be held and used, fair value of fixed (tangible) assets
      and
      definite-lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the
      projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved
      or
      an appraisal. For long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than
      by
      sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values
      are
      reduced for disposal costs.

The
      provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142
      "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require that goodwill and
      indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment
      and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing
      potential future impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill and
      indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value,
      as
      established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain
      related products, is less than their carrying value. The Company conducts its
      annual testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
      in the third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent
      testing.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As
      the
      Company’s assumptions related to long-lived assets are subject to change,
      additional write-downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair
      value
      less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is
      adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recorded fixed
      (tangible) asset impairments of $55 million and definite-lived intangible asset
      impairments of $1 million during 2006. The Company recorded fixed (tangible)
      asset impairments of $9 million and definite-lived intangible asset impairments
      of $3 million during 2005.

Environmental
      Costs

The
      Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the
      Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can
      be
      reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but
      the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum
      amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company’s assumptions
      about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the
      remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other
      potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and
      financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the
      estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement
      action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control
      regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.
      Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from
      the
      minimum or best estimate of $18 million to the maximum of $32 million at
      December 31, 2006.

In
      accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,"
      the
      Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated
      with
      the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as
      defined in SFAS No. 143, include but are not limited to waste management units,
      such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types
      of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future
      costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset
      based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable
      regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings
      over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates
      the useful life of each individual asset is up to 50 years. If the Company
      changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate
      of
      the useful lives of these

assets,
      expenses to be charged into earnings could increase or decrease.

In
      accordance with Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
      Retirement Obligations” ("FIN 47"), the Company also monitors conditional
      obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent
      that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable
      retirement costs.

The
      Company’s reserve for environmental contingencies was $47 million and $51
      million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing the minimum
      or
      best estimate for remediation costs and, for asset retirement obligation costs,
      the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets'
      estimated useful lives.

United
      States Pension and Other Post-employment Benefits

The
      Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees
      with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and
      health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for
      retirees’ eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these
      benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic
      conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets.
      At
      December 31, 2006, the Company assumed a discount rate of 5.86 percent and
      an
      expected return on assets of 9 percent. The cost of providing plan benefits
      also
      depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover,
      and plan participation.

        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

N/A

The
      expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the
      Company’s pension and other post-employment benefit obligations are established
      each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long-term
      expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds,
      primarily the domestic, international, and private equities markets. The actual
      return on assets has exceeded the expected return for the last 3 years. The
      assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds,
      which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the
      expected durations of the pension and post-employment benefit obligations.
      A

      percent increase or decrease in the health care trend would have had no material
      impact.

If
      actual
      experience differs from these assumptions, the difference is recorded as an
      unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a
      period of time, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits
      to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2006, 2005, and
      due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due
      to
      actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $54 million, $56
      million, and $44 million, respectively.

The
      Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post-employment
      obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate will impact the
      cash
      contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2007. However, an after-tax
      charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive
      income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, as of December 31, 2007 for
      the impact on the pension’s projected benefit obligation of the change in
      interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations
      does
      not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of
      the
      amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years.
      The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest
      rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees,
      and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other
      post-employment obligations, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company’s
      consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report
      on Form 10-K.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Litigation
      and Contingent Liabilities

From
      time
      to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits,
      claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal
      injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
      environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which
      are
      handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues
      a
      liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been
      incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot
      be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the
      Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including
      those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as
      incurred. The Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such
      pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by significant
      litigation adverse to the Company.

Income
      Taxes

The
      Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary
      differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
      liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year
      in
      which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the
      deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income
      using
      historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing
      temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies.
      Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is
      more
      likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that
      the
      actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and
      assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have
      a
      material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement
      of financial position. As of December 31, 2006, a valuation allowance of $130
      million has been provided against the deferred tax assets.

      OVERVIEW

The
      Company generated sales revenue of $7.5 billion for full year 2006, which was
      the highest in the Company's history and a 6 percent increase over 2005.

Operating
      earnings were $640 million in 2006, a decline of $117 million compared with
      2005. These results reflect continued strong earnings from the Company's broad
      base of businesses, with the decline substantially due to lower results in
      the
      Performance Polymers segment. During 2006, the Company was impacted by $400
      million higher raw material and energy costs. Most of the Company's
      businesses were able to offset these costs with higher selling prices, higher
      volumes and lower operating costs. However, the Performance Polymers segment
      had
      lower selling prices, particularly for

polyethylene
      terephthalate ("

PET")
      polymers, in spite of higher raw material costs, due to lower industry capacity
      utilization rates.

The
      Company continued to evaluate its portfolio of businesses and product lines
      to
      better focus on its core strengths and improve overall profitability. As a
      result of the strategic decisions made, operating earnings were negatively
      impacted by $10 million of accelerated depreciation and $101 million in asset
      impairment and restructuring charges. These charges were partially offset by
      $68
      million of other operating income from the sale of its polyethylene ("PE")
      business and related assets and the sale of its Batesville, Arkansas
      manufacturing facility and related assets. In 2006, these divested product
      lines
      had sales revenue of $811 million and operating earnings of $124 million.
      Operating earnings in 2005 included asset impairments and restructuring charges
      were $33 million and other operating income was $2 million.

        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In
      addition to achieving the above results, Eastman continued to progress on its
      overall growth objectives and announced its plans to improve the performance
      of
      its PET polymer product lines in the Performance Polymers segment. These efforts
      included:

·

the
                start-up of the Company's 350 thousand metric tons new PET facility
                using

IntegRex

technology in Columbia, South Carolina which is expected to be at
                full
                production by the end of the first quarter of
                2007;

·

plans
                to debottleneck the

IntegRex

technology facility for an additional 100 thousand metric tons of
                capacity, to be completed in early 2008;

·

rationalizing
                350 thousand metric tons of existing capacity in North America, to
                be
                completed by mid-2008;

·

plans
                to expand its acetate tow capacity in Workington, England in the
                Fibers
                segment;

·

continuing
                development of a new family of copolyesters in the Specialty Plastics
                ("SP") segment to be commercialized in 2007; and

·

furthering
                the advancement of its coal gasification
                efforts.

The
      Company is also considering various strategic options for its underperforming
      PET manufacturing facilities outside the United States that could lead to
      further restructuring, divestiture, or consolidation of product lines in the
      Performance Polymers segment to improve profitability. In first quarter 2007,
      the Company

entered
      into an agreement to sell the San Roque, Spain manufacturing
      facility

.

Net
      earnings for 2006 were $409 million versus 2005 net earnings of $557 million.
      Included in

      results were a $111 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of the Company's
      equity investment in Genencor International, Inc. ("Genencor") and early debt
      retirement costs of $28 million, net of tax.

The
      Company generated $609 million in cash from operating activities during 2006,
      a
      decrease of $160 million compared to 2005. The decline was due primarily to
      higher net earnings in 2005 compared with 2006 and an increase of $128 million
      in working capital in 2006, partially offset by lower pension contributions
      in
      the current year.

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Gross
      profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales for 2006 decreased,
      particularly in the Performance Polymers segment, compared with 2005 primarily
      due to increased raw material and energy costs and operational disruptions
      that
      were partially offset by higher selling prices. In 2006, raw material and energy
      costs increased by approximately $400 million compared to the prior year,
      compared to a selling price increase of $323 million.

In
      addition, 2006 included $10 million of accelerated depreciation

related
      to previously disclosed restructuring decisions in association with cracking
      units in Longview, Texas, and higher cost PET polymer assets in Columbia, South
      Carolina, which are scheduled for shutdown.

In 2007,
      accelerated depreciation will be approximately $50 million related to these
      assets.

R&D
      expenses for 2006 increased compared with 2005 primarily due to increased
      spending on growth initiatives, particularly in the SP segment, which more
      than
      offset lower expenses in the Performance Polymers segment.

Asset
      Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net

Asset
      impairments and restructuring charges totaled $101 million and $33 million
      during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company continues to review its
      portfolio of products and businesses, which could result in further
      restructuring, divestiture, and consolidation.

T

he
      Company expects its effective tax rate in 2007 will be approximately 35

SUMMARY
      BY OPERATING SEGMENT

The
      Company’s products and operations are managed and reported in five reportable
      operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the
      Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segment, the Performance
      Polymers segment and the SP segment.

The
      Company's segments were previously aligned in a divisional structure that
      provided for goods and services to be transferred between divisions at
      predetermined prices that may have been in excess of cost, which resulted in
      the
      recognition of intersegment sales revenue and operating earnings. Such
      interdivisional transactions were eliminated in the Company's consolidated
      financial statements. In first quarter 2006, the Company realigned its
      organizational structure to support its growth strategy and to better reflect
      the integrated nature of the Company's assets. A result of the realigned
      organizational structure is that goods and services are transferred among the
      segments at cost. As part of this change, the Company's segment results have
      been restated to eliminate the impact of interdivisional sales revenue and
      operating earnings.

For
      additional information and analysis of the results of the Company’s operating
      segments,

see
      Note
      21, "Segment Information", to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in
      Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Exhibits 99.01to
      this Annual Report.

In
      the
      first quarter of 2006, management determined that the Developing Businesses
      ("DB") segment is not of continuing significance for financial reporting
      purposes. As a result, revenues and costs previously included in the DB segment
      and R&D expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included
      in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown
      in Note 21, "Segment Information", to the Company's consolidated financial
      statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K as "other"
      revenues and operating losses.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In
      fourth
      quarter 2006, certain product lines were transferred from the PCI segment to
      the
      Performance Polymers segment. During 2005 and 2004, these amounts were included
      within the PCI segment. Accordingly, the prior year's amounts for sales and
      operating earnings have been adjusted to retrospectively apply these changes
      to
      all periods presented.

Sales
      revenue increased $122 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to an increase
      in
      selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs.

Operating
      earnings increased $1 million for 2006 compared to 2005 including increased
      asset impairments and restructuring charges. Asset impairments and restructuring
      charges of $13 million for 2006 related to previously closed manufacturing
      facilities and severance related to a voluntary reduction in force. Asset
      impairments and restructuring charges of $4 million for 2005 related primarily
      to previously closed manufacturing facilities. These charges are more fully
      described in Note 16, "Impairments and Restructuring Charges", to the Company’s
      consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report
      on Form 10-K. Excluding these items, operating earnings increased due to an
      increase in selling prices that more than offset higher raw material and energy
      costs, and favorable product mix that resulted from higher sales volume for
      specialty coatings.

In
      November 2006, the Company sold the CASPI segment's

Epolene

polymer
      businesses and related assets. CASPI sales revenue and operating earnings
      attributed to the divested businesses were $65 million and $3 million,
      respectively, for 2006.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales
      revenue increased $41 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher
      selling prices and higher sales volume that were partially offset by an
      unfavorable shift in product mix.

The
      higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs
      as well as continued strong demand for and limited supply of acetate yarn and
      acetyl chemical products. The increased sales volume and shift in product mix
      were due to strong demand for acetyl chemical products attributed to
      strengthened global acetate tow demand.

Operating
      earnings for 2006 compared to 2005 increased $10 million as higher selling
      prices and increased sales volume more than offset higher raw material and
      energy costs. Asset impairment and restructuring charges of $2 million in 2006
      related primarily to severance due to a voluntary reduction in force.

The
      Company believes that acetate tow has modest growth potential in future years
      and has been evaluating growth options in Europe and Asia. In the third quarter
      2006, the Company announced plans to add capacity and expand production of

Estron

acetate
      tow in Europe at its Workington, England facility. The Company continues to
      evaluate options for growth in Asia.


MANAGEMENT'S
          DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
          AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales
      revenue for 2006 compared to 2005 increased $99 million primarily due to higher
      selling prices, particularly in the intermediates product lines, in response
      to
      increases in raw material and energy costs.

Operating
      earnings for 2006 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $20
      million primarily related to the divestiture of the PCI segment's Batesville,
      Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets and specialty organic
      chemicals product lines completed in the fourth quarter 2006 and to severance
      related to a voluntary reduction in force. The 2006 operating earnings also
      included

$2
      million

of
      accelerated depreciation for cracking units at the Company's Longview, Texas
      facility and $7 million of other operating charges related to the above
      mentioned divestiture.

Excluding
      those items, operating earnings increased compared with 2005 as higher selling
      prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. PCI sales revenue
      and operating loss attributed to the divested product lines were $111 million
      and $15 million, respectively, for 2006. The 2005 operating earnings included
      $11 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges for previously
      impaired sites and $10 million of operating earnings from the achievement of
      certain milestones under an acetyls technology licensing agreement.

In
      addition, as part of the transition agreement pertaining to the PE divestiture,
      the Company will supply ethylene to the buyer. The supply of ethylene to the
      buyer, which was formerly used internally, will be reported in the PCI segment.
      The Company also expects to begin a staged phase-out of older cracking units
      in
      2007, with timing dependent in part on market conditions.

Includes
      allocated costs consistent with the Company’s historical practices, some of
      which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and
      other segments.

In
      fourth
      quarter 2006, the Company completed the divestiture of the Performance Polymer
      segment's PE businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site
      and the Company's ethylene pipeline.

Sales
      revenue increased $56 million for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher
      sales volume, particularly for PET polymers in Latin America, mostly offset
      by
      lower sales volume for PET polymers in North America attributed to lower
      industry capacity utilization rates.

Excluding
      the divested product lines, sales revenue increased $39 million.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Operating
      earnings decreased $122 million for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to
      higher and continued volatile raw material and energy costs, lower selling
      prices for PET polymers globally, increased asset impairments and restructuring
      charges and increased accelerated depreciation more than offsetting other
      operating income and increased sales volume. Asset impairments and restructuring
      charges of $46 million for 2006 were primarily related to the shutdown of a
      research and development Kingsport, Tennessee pilot plant, discontinued
      production of cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM") modified polymers in San Roque,
      Spain and severance related to a reduction in force in the U.S. and Spain.
      CHDM,
      an internal intermediate product primarily used in copolyester and PET
      production, was discontinued in San Roque, Spain to gain operational
      efficiencies at other facilities. These charges are more fully described in
      Note
      16, "Impairments and Restructuring Charges", to the Company's consolidated
      financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form
      10-K.
      Accelerated depreciation of $7 million for 2006 related to previously disclosed
      restructuring decisions in association with cracking units in Longview, Texas,
      and higher cost PET polymer intermediates assets in Columbia, South Carolina,
      which are scheduled for shutdown. Other operating income for 2006 reflects
      a
      gain of $75 million on the above mentioned divestiture. Excluding the divested
      product lines, operating earnings decreased $183 million.

Production
      began in November 2006 at the Company's new PET manufacturing facility utilizing

IntegRex

technology in Columbia, South Carolina. Manufacturing

ParaStar

next
      generation PET resins, the Company expects the facility to be at its full
      operational capacity of 350 thousand metric tons during the first quarter of

      Company is continuing to evaluate its strategic and operational options related
      to certain underperforming PET assets to improve profitability of the segment.
      In first quarter 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the San
      Roque, Spain manufacturing facility.

Sales
      revenue for 2006 increased $100 million compared to 2005 due primarily to
      increased sales volume and higher selling prices. The increased sales volume
      was
      primarily attributed to continued market development efforts, particularly
      in
      copolyester product lines. Selling prices increased to offset higher raw
      material and energy costs with increases limited by competitive industry
      dynamics.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Operating
      earnings for 2006 declined $18

million
      compared with 2005 primarily due to asset impairment and restructuring charges,
      increased expenditures related to growth initiatives and higher raw material
      and
      energy costs slightly more than offsetting increased sales volume and higher
      selling prices.

Asset
      impairment and restructuring charges of $16 million in 2006 were related to
      the
      discontinued production of CHDM, an internal intermediate product primarily
      used
      in copolyester and PET production, in San Roque, Spain to gain operational
      efficiencies at other facilities. Accelerated depreciation of $1 million for
      2006 related primarily to South Carolina operations.

Sales
      revenue in the United States and Canada increased primarily due to higher
      selling prices, particularly in the PCI segment, which had a $78 million
      positive impact on sales revenue. The higher selling prices were primarily
      in
      response to increases in raw material and energy costs.

Sales
      revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased primarily due to higher
      selling prices, particularly in the CASPI segment, and higher
      volumes

particularly
      in the

Performance
      Polymer segment.

The
      higher selling prices were primarily in response to increases in raw material
      and energy costs.

Sales
      revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher selling prices,
      partially offset by lower sales volume and changes in mix. Higher selling
      prices, particularly in the Fibers segment, had a $76 million positive impact
      on
      sales revenue. Lower sales volume and negative mix, particularly for the Fibers
      segment, had a $61 million negative impact on sales revenue.

Sales
      revenue in Latin America increased primarily due to higher sales volume,
      particularly in the Performance Polymers segment.

With
      a
      substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman
      is
      subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To
      mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate
      payment terms in U.S. dollars and euros. In addition, where it deems such
      actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions
      and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment
      of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate.
      For
      more information on these practices see Note 9 to the Company’s consolidated

Sales
      revenue for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to increased selling
      prices of approximately $1 billion throughout the Company that more than offset
      a decrease in volume resulting from divested businesses and product lines in
      2004. The increase in selling prices was primarily in response to an increase
      in
      raw material and energy costs and the Company’s efforts to improve
      profitability.

      and
      higher bad debt expense, which more than offset decreases resulting from the
      previous divestiture of certain businesses and product lines within the CASPI
      segment and the shutdown of operations at Cendian.

R&D
      expenses for 2005 increased compared with 2004 primarily due to

expenditures on growth initiatives in the SP segment and corporate R&D,

Impairments
      and Restructuring Charges, Net

Impairments
      and restructuring charges totaled $33 million during 2005, consisting of
      non-cash asset impairments of $12 million and restructuring charges of $21
      million. During 2004, these charges totaled $206 million, consisting of non-cash
      asset impairments of $140 million and restructuring charges of $66 million.

Other
      Operating Income

Other
      operating income of $2 million for 2005 included a $2 million gain associated
      with a change in estimates for contingencies related to the 2004 divestiture
      of
      certain businesses and product lines within the CASPI segment. Other operating
      income of $7 million in 2004 resulted from the sale of Ariel Research
      Corporation ("Ariel").

Operating
      earnings for 2005 increased $582 million.

Key
      factors in the improved results, aided by strong economic growth,
      were:

·

increased
                selling prices throughout the Company of approximately $1 billion
                in
                response to increasing raw material and energy
                costs;

·

lower
                asset impairment and restructuring charges of $33 million in 2005
                compared
                to $206 million in 2004;

·

      for 2004 was impacted by the treatment of asset impairments and restructuring
      charges resulting in lower expected tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SUMMARY
      BY OPERATING SEGMENT

(1)

These
      businesses and product lines exclude acrylate ester monomers, composites
      (unsaturated polyester resins), inks and graphic arts raw materials, liquid
      resins, powder resins and textile chemicals divested on July 31, 2004 as well
      as
      other restructuring, divestiture and consolidation activities that the Company
      has completed related to these businesses and product lines.

The
      decrease in sales revenue of $255 million was due to lower sales volume
      resulting from the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and product lines
      within the segment. Sales revenue for continuing product lines increased $186
      million, with selling prices positively impacting revenues 18 percent, driven
      by
      cyclical commodity products.

The
      increase in operating earnings was the result of increased selling prices that
      more than offset higher raw material costs; lower asset impairment and
      restructuring charges; an increased focus on more profitable businesses and
      product lines, including the aforementioned sale of certain businesses and
      product lines within the segment; improved gross profit margins, particularly
      for cyclical commodity product lines; and the impact of cost reduction
      efforts.

Operating
      earnings for 2005 and 2004 were reduced by asset impairments and restructuring
      charges totaling approximately $4 million and $81 million, respectively. These
      charges are more fully described in Note 16, "Asset Impairments and
      Restructuring Charges, Net", in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
      in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating earnings
      for 2005 included $2 million of other operating income related to a change
      in
      estimates for contingencies associated with the aforementioned sale of certain
      businesses and product lines within the segment.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales
      revenue increased $138 million due to higher selling prices and increased sales
      volume. The higher sales volume was attributed to stronger demand for acetate
      tow, primarily in China, due to higher cigarette production volumes, a trend
      towards longer cigarette filters and substitution of acetate tow for
      polypropylene in cigarette filters. Demand for acetate tow in Eastern Europe
      increased due to increased cigarette production volumes. Market share for
      acetate yarn increased due to the exit of a major competitor from the acetate
      yarn market.

Operating
      earnings increased due to higher sales volumes and increased selling prices
      that
      more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.

In
      2005,
      a major global competitor exited the acetate filament yarn market. As a direct
      result, Eastman became the world leader in acetate yarn production, the only
      acetate yarn producer vertically integrated in acetate flake production, and
      the
      only acetate yarn producer in North America. The yarn market tightened
      significantly as the competitor's yarn inventory was consumed in the world
      marketplace, and world prices for acetate yarn increased to profitable levels
      during late 2005.

The
      increase in sales revenue of $256 million was primarily due to higher selling
      prices which had a positive impact on revenues of $244 million, and higher
      sales
      volumes, which had a positive impact on revenues of $40 million. Selling prices
      and sales volume were higher particularly in the intermediates product lines
      in
      response to significant increases in raw material and energy costs, an upturn
      in
      the olefins cycle, and improved market conditions in acetyl product lines.
      The
      sales volume increase was also attributed to long-term arrangements with key
      customers and increased production capacity.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The
      increase in operating earnings of $139 million was primarily due to increases
      in
      selling prices and ongoing cost reduction efforts that more than offset higher
      raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings for 2005 included $10 million
      of operating earnings from the achievement of certain milestones under an
      acetyls technology licensing agreement. Operating earnings for 2005 also
      included $11 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges for
      previously impaired sites. Operating earnings for 2004 included $38 million
      in
      asset impairments related to assets at the Company's Batesville, Arkansas and
      Longview, Texas facilities, as well as severance charges.

(1)

Includes
      allocated costs consistent with the Company’s historical practices, some of
      which may remain and could be reallocated to the remainder of the segment and
      other segments.

In
      December 2006, the Company completed the sale of the Performance Polymer
      segment's PE businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site
      and the Company's ethylene pipeline.

The
      increase in sales revenue of $360 million was primarily due to

increased
      selling prices, which had a positive impact of $424 million. The increased
      selling prices were mainly the result of efforts to offset higher raw material
      and energy costs. The lower sales volume was attributed to several factors:
      the
      effects of higher and volatile raw material and energy costs in North America
      due to the Gulf Coast hurricanes, including the impact of lower raw material
      costs for Asian producers of PET polymers to North America and customers working
      down inventories; and low PET polymers industry operating rates in Europe and
      Latin America due to a combination of lower than expected demand and
      overcapacity in southern and eastern Europe and Asian imports in South America.
      Excluding the divested product lines, sales revenue increased $253
      million.

Operating
      earnings increased as higher selling prices and reduced costs attributed to
      ongoing cost reduction efforts more than offset higher raw material and energy
      costs, resulting in improved margins, primarily in the PE markets and North
      American PET markets, prior to the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Operating earnings
      for
      2004 were also reduced by asset impairments and restructuring charges of $13
      million related to severance. Excluding the divested product lines, operating
      earnings increased $109 million.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales
      revenue increased $74 million due to higher selling prices, which had a positive
      impact of $75 million. Despite higher sales volume for copolyester product
      lines, particularly for consumer and medical goods, overall sales volume
      declined primarily due to the lower sales volume of acetate used in photographic
      film.

Operating
      earnings increased by $51 million compared to 2004 due to lower asset
      impairments and restructuring charges, higher selling prices, improved product
      mix, and ongoing cost reduction efforts partially offset by higher raw material
      and energy costs, and expenditures related to growth initiatives. Operating
      earnings for 2004 included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $53
      million related primarily to the closure of the Hartlepool, United Kingdom
      manufacturing facility, as well as severance charges.

Sales
      revenue in the United States and Canada increased primarily due to higher
      selling prices, particularly for the Polymers, PCI, and CASPI segments, which
      had a $723 million positive impact on sales revenue. The higher selling prices
      mostly related to sales of PET polymers, PE, intermediates chemicals, and other
      cyclical commodity product lines and were primarily in response to increases
      in
      raw material and energy costs and high industry-wide capacity utilization.
      Lower
      overall sales volumes had a $208 million negative impact on sales revenue and
      were primarily due to the impact of the restructuring, divestiture, and
      consolidation activities in the CASPI segment, partially offset by significantly
      higher sales volumes in the PCI segment. The Cendian shutdown was reflected
      in

product
      mix which had a $140 million negative impact on sales revenue.

        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales
      revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa decreased primarily due to lower
      sales volumes, mainly the result of the impact of the restructuring,
      divestiture, and consolidation activities in the CASPI segment, which had a
      $224
      million negative impact on sales revenue. Higher selling prices, particularly
      for PET polymers, had a $77 million positive impact on sales
      revenue.

Sales
      revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher overall selling prices
      across all segments which had a $92 million positive impact on sales revenue.
      Higher sales volumes, particularly for the Fibers segment, had a $34 million
      positive impact on sales revenue.

Sales
      revenue in Latin America increased primarily due to higher selling prices,
      partially offset by lower sales volume. Higher selling prices, particularly
      for
      PET polymers, had a $119 million positive impact on sales revenue. Lower sales
      volume, particularly for PET polymers and PE, had a $49 million negative impact
      on sales revenue.

Cash
      provided by operating activities decreased $160 million in 2006 compared with
      2005 primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements and a decrease
      in earnings, partially offset by lower current year cash contributions to its
      U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In 2006, the Company's working capital
      requirements increased, primarily due to a higher mix of sales in Latin America
      and Europe, where customer credit terms are longer as compared to North America.
      The Company contributed $75 million and $165 million to its U.S. defined benefit
      pension plan in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Cash
      provided by operating activities increased $275 million in 2005 compared with
      2004 primarily as a result of a significant increase in earnings and a decrease
      in working capital requirements, partially offset by $165 million in
      contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The decrease in working
      capital requirements related primarily to accounts receivable, largely the
      result of improved collection performance which more than offset the increase
      in
      sales, partially offset by an increase in inventories. The Company made $3
      million in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in
      2004.

Cash
      used
      in investing activities totaled $94 million and $18 million in 2006 and 2005,
      respectively. In 2006, the Company received $74 million in proceeds from the
      sale of its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets
      and
      the specialty organic chemicals product lines and $235 million in proceeds
      from
      the sale of PE and

Epolene

polymer
      businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site and the
      Company's ethylene pipeline. For more information concerning divestitures,
      see
      Note 24, "Divestitures", to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in
      Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 2005, the Company
      received $417 million net cash proceeds from the sale of its equity investment
      in Genencor. Capital spending of $389 million and $343 million in 2006 and
      2005,
      respectively, included expenditures related to the construction of the new
      PET
      facility utilizing

IntegRex

technology.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cash
      used
      in investing activities decreased $130 million in 2005 compared with 2004
      largely due to $417 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Company's
      investment in Genencor in the second quarter 2005. In addition, in the second
      quarter 2005, the Company received payment for the $50 million note it received
      in the sale of certain businesses and product lines in the CASPI segment.

In
      2004,
      the Company received $115 million in net cash proceeds associated with such
      sale, as well as $12 million in proceeds from the sale of Ariel.

In
      the
      fourth quarter 2005, the Company provided a line of credit up to $125 million
      to
      Primester, a joint venture in which Eastman has a 50 percent interest, which
      Primester fully utilized to repay its third-party borrowings, which had
      previously been guaranteed by Eastman. In addition, t

he
      Company used an additional $95 million for additions to properties and equipment
      in 2005 as compared with 2004.

Cash
      used
      in financing activities in 2006 totaled $101 million and included a decrease
      in
      credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of $50 million,
      offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $83 million.

Cash
      used
      in financing activities in 2005 totaled $547 million and included the Company's
      early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding long-term debt, and a
      decrease in credit facility and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts,
      of
      $150 million, offset by cash received from stock option exercises of $98
      million. S

for
      information regarding the early extinguishment of debt. In addition, the Company
      borrowed $191 million from a new credit facility in the fourth quarter 2005,
      the
      proceeds of which

provided
      a significant part of the funding for the repatriation of undistributed foreign
      earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.

Cash
      used
      in financing activities in 2004 totaled $579 million and reflects the January
      2004 repayment of $500 million of 6 3/8% notes and a decrease in commercial
      paper, credit facility, and other borrowings, including bank overdrafts, of
      $19
      million, offset by cash from stock option exercises of $77 million.

The
      payment of dividends is also reflected in financing activities in all
      periods.

Liquidity

At
      December 31, 2006, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S. and
      foreign banks totaling approximately $885 million. These credit facilities
      consist of a $700 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility")
      expiring in April 2011, as well as a 140 million Euro credit facility ("Euro
      Facility") which expires in December 2011. Both credit facilities have options
      for two one-year extensions, and the first extension option for the Euro
      Facility has been exercised. Borrowings under these credit facilities are
      subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. These credit
      facilities require facility fees on the total commitment that are based on
      Eastman’s credit rating. In addition, these credit facilities contain a number
      of covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain
      financial ratios. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s credit facility borrowings
      totaled $185 million at a

n

effective

interest
      rate of 4.00 percent. At December 31, 2005, the Company's credit facility
      borrowings were $214 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.01
      percent.

The
      Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings
      and
      general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper
      borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Since the
      Credit Facility expires in April 2011, any commercial paper borrowings supported
      by the Credit Facility are classified as long-term borrowings because the
      Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long-term
      basis.

For
      more
      information regarding interest rates, see Note 7, "Borrowings", to the Company’s
      consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report
      on Form 10-K.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The
      Company has effective shelf registration statements filed with the Securities
      and Exchange Commission to issue a combined $1.1 billion of debt or equity
      securities.

In
      the
      second quarter 2005, Eastman completed the sale of its equity interest in
      Genencor for approximately $417 million in net cash proceeds after tax. This
      action, combined with strong operating results, allowed the Company to complete
      the early repayment of $500 million of its outstanding debt in second quarter
      2005, further strengthening its financial position.

During
      2006, the Company contributed $75 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension
      plan. In first quarter 2007, the Company completed a planned $100 million
      contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan.

Cash
      flows from operations and the sources of capital described above are expected
      to
      be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. However,
      the Company’s cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors
      including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability
      and
      cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman’s products, capacity utilization, and
      other factors described under "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors"
      below. The Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with
      an
      investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial
      flexibility.

Capital
      Expenditures

Capital
      expenditures were $389 million, $343 million, and $248 million for 2006, 2005,
      and 2004, respectively. The increase of $46 million in 2006 compared with 2005
      was primarily due to spending on the expansion of CHDM capacity, as well as
      other growth initiatives. The Company expects that 2007 capital spending will
      be
      up to $450 million which will exceed estimated 2007 depreciation and
      amortization of

approximately
      $350

million,
      including accelerated depreciation of $50 million. In 2007, the Company will
      continue to pursue projects including

an
      acetate tow expansion in England, a copolyester intermediates expansion, make
      enhancements to benefit the PET facilities in South Carolina, utilizing

IntegRex

technology,
      and other growth initiatives.

Other
      Commitments

At
      December 31, 2006, the Company’s obligations related to notes and debentures
      totaled approximately $1.4 billion to be paid over a period of approximately
      years. Other borrowings, related primarily to credit facility borrowings,
      totaled approximately $200 million.

The
      Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2006 totaling
      approximately $2.1 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for
      materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
      The
      Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under
      cancelable, noncancelable, and month-to-month operating leases totaling
      approximately $200 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease
      commitments, approximately 12 percent relate to machinery and equipment,
      including computer and communications equipment and production equipment;
      approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space,
      storage facilities and land; and approximately 38 percent relate to
      railcars.

In
      addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2006 totaling
      approximately $1.4 billion related primarily to pension, retiree medical, other
      post-employment obligations and environmental reserves.

(a)
      Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company
      primarily for pension and other post-employment benefits in the periods
      indicated. The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest
      rates, health care trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and
      attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans,
      and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing
      of any future contributions by the Company.

Purchase
      obligations increased approximately $360 million at December 31, 2006 compared
      to December 31, 2005 due primarily to increased raw material prices.

Off
      Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements

If
      certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion
      of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of
      the
      related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees
      at
      December 31, 2006 totaled $113 million and consisted primarily of leases for
      railcars, company aircraft, and other equipment.

Leases
      with guarantee amounts totaling $2 million, $27 million, and $84 million will
      expire in 2007, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

The
      Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood
      of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote.

As
      described in Note 5, "Equity Investments and Other Noncurrent Assets and
      Liabilities", to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in Part II,
      Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Eastman has a 50 percent
      interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture
      which manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company's Kingsport, Tennessee
      plant. During fourth quarter 2005, t

he
      Company provided a line of credit to the joint venture of up to $125 million,
      which Primester fully utilized to pay the principal amount of the joint
      venture's third-party borrowings, previously guaranteed by Eastman.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As
      described in Note 11, "Commitments", to the Company’s consolidated financial
      statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Eastman
      entered into an agreement in 1999 that allows it to generate cash by reducing
      its working capital through the sale of undivided interests in certain domestic
      trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third
      party. Under this agreement, receivables sold to the third party totaled $200
      million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Undivided interests in designated
      receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the
      purchased interest in the receivable pools.

The
      Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated
      entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for
      the
      purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow
      or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing,
      liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such
      relationships.

The
      Company has evaluated material relationships including the guarantees related
      to
      the third-party borrowings of joint ventures described above and has concluded
      that the entities are not Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) or, in the case of
      Primester, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As such,
      in
      accordance with

Financial
      Accounting Standards Board ("

FASB")

Interpretation
      Number 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"

("FIN
      46R")

,
      the
      Company is not required to consolidate these entities. In addition, the Company
      has evaluated long-term purchase obligations with two entities that may be
      VIEs
      at December 31, 2006. These potential VIEs are joint ventures from which the
      Company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and
      purchases approximately $60 million of raw materials and utilities on an annual
      basis. The Company has no equity interest in these entities and has confirmed
      that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate the potential
      VIE. However, due to competitive and other reasons, the Company has not been
      able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the
      entities are VIEs, and if one or both are VIEs, whether or not the Company
      is
      the primary beneficiary.

Guarantees
      and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships
      with suppliers, customers, and non-consolidated affiliates when the Company
      undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified
      triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract could trigger an
      obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon
      alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters,
      and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results
      is
      not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists
      as
      to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities
      resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the
      period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material
      adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
      liquidity.

See
      Note
      10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements
      in
      Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K for off-balance sheet
      post-employment benefit obligations.

Treasury
      Stock Transactions

The
      Company was authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of its common stock.
      No
      shares of Eastman common stock were repurchased by the Company during 2006,
      or 2004 under a Company repurchase plan. A total of 2,746,869 shares of common
      stock at a cost of approximately $112 million, or an average price of
      approximately $41 per share, have been repurchased under the authorization.
      Repurchased shares may be used to meet common stock requirements for
      compensation and benefit plans and other corporate purposes.

On
      February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors cancelled its prior authorization
      for
      stock repurchases dated February 4, 1999 and approved a new authorization for
      the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company's outstanding common stock
      at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the
      best interests of the Company. Repurchased shares may be used for such purposes
      or otherwise applied in such a manner as determined to be in the best interests
      of the Company.

Dividends

The
      Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per share for a total of
      $1.76 per share in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Preferred
      Stock Purchase Rights

During
      the fourth quarter of 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company redeemed
      all
      of the outstanding preferred stock purchase rights issuable pursuant to the
      Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement and terminated the Stockholder
      Protection Rights Agreement. The payment of $0.01 per share of common stock
      was
      made January 2, 2007.

ENVIRONMENTAL

Certain
      Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which
      the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various
      governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous
      waste
      sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a
      potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection
      Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
      Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability
      for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur
      costs
      for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal
      Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Adequate reserves for environmental
      contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman’s policies as
      described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company’s
      consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report
      on Form 10-K. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal
      defenses, and the Company’s preliminary assessment of actions that may be
      required, it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters,
      individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company’s consolidated
      financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The
      Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the
      Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can
      be
      reasonably estimated.

When
      a
      single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated
      within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted
      accrued amount reflects the Company’s assumptions about remediation requirements
      at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions
      with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at
      multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially
      responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based,
      unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety,
      environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could
      result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures
      for
      remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $18 million to
      the
      maximum of $32 million at December 31, 2006.

In
      addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for
      closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains.
      Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units,
      such
      as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of
      assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the
      anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on
      its
      expected life and the applicable

regulatory
      closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over
      the
      estimated useful life of the assets.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In
      March
      2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset
      Retirement Obligations"

("
      FIN
      47"), which was effective for the Company on December 31, 2005. FIN 47 requires
      an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation
      when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation
      also clarifies that the term Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation ("CARO")
      refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which
      the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that
      may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when
      an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair
      value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company performed a thorough
      examination of various asset categories. Although it may have CARO

s

at
      certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for
      asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential
      settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these
      obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake
      a
      major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of
      asbestos. The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as
      well as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated
      with
      them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available
      concerning applicable retirement costs.

The
      recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated
      financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Reserves
      related to environmental assets accounted for approximately 60 percent of the
      total environmental reserve at December 31, 2006. Currently, the Company’s
      environmental assets are expected to be no longer useable at different times
      over the next 50 years. If the Company were to invest in numerous new
      environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant
      number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization
      on
      them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Company’s
      financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood
      of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past
      experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual
      related to environmental assets will be necessary.

INFLATION

In
      recent
      years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on
      Eastman's costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price,
      although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to
      mitigate short-term market price fluctuations. For additional information see
      Note 9, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments", to the Company’s consolidated
      financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2006 Annual Report on Form
      10-K.

RECENTLY
      ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In
      February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
      Financial Instruments,” an amendment of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers
      and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities." SFAS
      No.
      155 simplifies accounting for certain hybrid instruments under SFAS No. 133
      by
      permitting fair value remeasurement for financial instruments containing an
      embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155
      eliminates both the previous restriction under SFAS No. 140 on passive
      derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity may hold and
      SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to
      Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets,” which provides that
      beneficial interests are not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 133. SFAS
      No.
      155 also establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
      financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or
      that
      are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
      bifurcation, and clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
      subordination are not imbedded derivatives. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all
      financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event
      occurring after the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after
      September 15, 2006. The Company has evaluated the effect of SFAS No. 155 and
      determined that it does not expect a material impact from the adoption to its
      consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results from operations.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In
      March
      2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial
      Assets,” an amendment of SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 156 permits entities to choose
      to either subsequently measure servicing rights at fair value and report changes
      in fair value in earnings or amortize servicing rights in proportion to and
      over
      the estimated net servicing income or loss and assess to rights for impairment
      or the need for an increased obligation. SFAS No. 156 also clarifies when a
      servicer should separately recognize servicing assets and liabilities; requires
      all separately recognized assets and liabilities to be initially measured at
      fair value, if practicable; permits a one-time reclassification of
      available-for-sales securities to trading securities by an entity with
      recognized servicing rights and requires additional disclosures for all
      separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is
      effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after
      September 15, 2006. The Company has evaluated the effect of SFAS No. 156 and
      determined that it does not expect a material impact from the adoption to its
      consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results from operations.

In
      July
      2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for
      Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income
      Taxes". FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should
      recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain
      tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
      Under
      FIN 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences
      of such positions presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the
      position and all relevant facts, but without considering time values. FIN 48
      also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive, annual,
      tabular roll-forward of the unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective
      for
      fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect
      the
      adoption of FIN 48 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial
      position, liquidity, or results of operations.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which
      addresses the measurement of fair value by companies when they are required
      to
      use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP.
      SFAS
      No. 157 provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP
      which is intended to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and
      comparable and improve disclosures about those measures. SFAS No. 157 will
      be
      effective for an entity's financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
      after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS
      No.
      157 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results
      of
      operations.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position No. AUG AIR-1 ("FSP No. AUG
      AIR-1") which addresses the accounting for planned major maintenance activities.
      FSP No. AUG AIR-1 amends certain provisions in the American Institute of
      Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Industry Audit Guide and APB Opinion
      No.
      28, "Interim Financial Reporting". Four alternative methods of accounting for
      planned major maintenance activities were permitted: direct expense, built-in
      overhaul, deferral, and accrual ("accrue-in-advance"). This FSP prohibits the
      use of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance
      activities because it results in the recognition of a liability in a period
      prior to the occurrence of the transaction or event obligating the entity.
      FSP
      No. AUG AIR-1 is effective for an entity's financial statements issued for
      fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not utilize
      the
      accrue-in-advance method of accounting and therefore expects this FSP to have
      no
      impact on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of
      operations.

In
      February, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for
      Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB
      Statement No. 115." SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many
      financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified
      election dates. Upon adoption, an entity shall report unrealized gains and
      losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings
      at
      each subsequent reporting date. Most of the provisions apply only to entities
      that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No. 115,
      "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," applies
      to
      all entities with available for sale and trading securities. SFAS No. 159 will
      be effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins
      after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS
      No.
      159 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results
      of
      operations.

OUTLOOK

For
      2007,
      the Company expects:

·

strong
                volumes will be maintained due to continued economic strength, continued
                substitution of Eastman products for other materials, and new applications
                for existing products;

·

the
                volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the
                Company
                will continue to pursue pricing strategies and ongoing cost control
                initiatives to offset the effects on gross
                profit;

·

a
                staged phase-out of older cracking units and a planned shutdown of
                higher
                cost PET assets in South Carolina will continue in 2007, resulting
                in
                accelerated depreciation in 2007 of approximately $50 million;

·

to
                increase volumes in the PCI segment due to the transition agreement
                pertaining to the polyethylene divestiture; the Company will supply
                ethylene to the buyer, allowing both companies to optimize the value
                of
                their respective olefin businesses under various market
                conditions;

·

to
                contribute $100 million to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension
                plan, all of which was contributed in the first quarter of
                2007;

·

net
                interest expense to decrease compared with 2006 primarily due to
                higher
                interest income, driven by higher invested cash
                balances;

·

the
                effective tax rate to be approximately 35
                percent;

·

that
                acetate tow will have modest growth potential in future years and;
                therefore, expects to continue to evaluate growth options in Asia;

·

to
                aggressively take action to improve the performance of its PET product
                lines in the Performance Polymers segment, including starting up
                the
                Company's new PET facility utilizing

IntegRex

technology in Columbia, South Carolina, debottlenecking the new PET

technology for an additional 100 thousand metric tons of capacity,
                rationalizing 350 thousand metric tons of existing capacity in North
                America, entering into an agreement to sell the Spain PET manufacturing
                facility, and considering other strategic options for its underperforming
                PET manufacturing facilities outside the United States, which may
                lead to
                further restructuring and asset impairment charges;

FORWARD-LOOKING
      STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS

The
      expectations under "Outlook" and certain other statements in this Annual Report
      on Form 10-K may be forward-looking in nature as defined in the Private
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and other written
      and
      oral forward-looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate
      to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases
      and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and
      amortization; environmental matters; legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects
      of hedging of, raw material and energy costs, foreign currencies and interest
      rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions;
      competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost,
      margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial
      results and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual
      assets and products, businesses and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman
      Chemical Company; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans;
      pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated restructuring,
      divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts
      and targets; integration of acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and
      development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products,
      services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product
      portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs.

These
      plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including
      those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn
      based
      upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends,
      management plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These
      plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily
      subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions
      and
      results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed
      in
      the forward-looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions
      and
      expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the
      factors described in this report, the following are some of the important
      factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially
      from
      those in any such forward-looking statements:

·

The
                Company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials and energy
                commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools,
                including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market
                fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. There can be no assurance,
                however, that such measures will result in cost savings or that all
                market
                fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. In addition, natural disasters,
                changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities
                or
                terrorism or other political factors in any of the countries or regions
                in
                which the Company operates or does business or in countries or regions
                that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials and energy commodities,
                or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used
                for
                delivery of strategic raw materials and energy commodities, could
                affect
                availability and costs of raw materials and energy
                commodities.

·

While
                temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally
                occur,
                these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover
                current
                and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability
                and
                price are impacted by natural disasters, plant interruptions occurring
                during periods of high demand, domestic and world market and political
                conditions, changes in government regulation, war or other outbreak
                of
                hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation
                infrastructure. Eastman’s operations or products may, at times, be
                adversely affected by these factors.


MANAGEMENT'S
          DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
          AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

·

The
                Company's competitive position in the markets in which it participates
                is,
                in part, subject to external factors in addition to those that the
                Company
                can impact. Natural disasters, pandemic illnesses, changes in laws
                or
                regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, or
                other
                political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the
                Company
                operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key
                suppliers of strategic raw materials, and breakdown or degradation
                of
                transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw materials
                and
                energy supplies to the Company and for delivery of the Company's
                products
                to customers, could negatively impact the Company’s competitive position
                and its ability to maintain market share. For example, supply and
                demand
                for certain of the Company's products is driven by end-use markets
                and
                worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing
                of the
                Company's products.

Limitation
                of the Company's available manufacturing capacity due to significant
                disruption in its manufacturing operations, including natural disasters,
                pandemic illnesses, changes in laws or regulations, war or other
                outbreak
                of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors in any of
                the
                countries or regions in which the Company operates or does business,

                breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for
                delivery of raw materials and energy supplies to the Company and
                for
                delivery of the Company's products to customers, could have a material
                adverse affect on sales revenue, costs and results of operations
                and
                financial condition.

·

The
                Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material
                financial weakness of, certain of the largest customers could adversely
                affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations
                until
                such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the
                Company
                would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.

·

The
                Company's competitive position has recently been adversely impacted
                by low
                cost competitors in certain regions and customers developing internal
                or
                alternative sources of supply.

·

The
                Company has efforts underway to exploit growth opportunities in certain
                core businesses by developing new products and technologies, expanding
                into new markets, and tailoring product offerings to customer needs.
                Current examples include

IntegRex

technology and new PET polymers products and copolyester product
                innovations There can be no assurance that such efforts will result
                in
                financially successful commercialization of such products or acceptance
                by
                existing or new customers or new markets or that large capital projects

                projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability

technology
                and coal gasification, and has entered, and expects to continue to
                enter,
                into strategic alliances in technology, services businesses, and
                other
                ventures in order to build, diversify, and strengthen certain Eastman
                capabilities, improve Eastman's raw materials and energy cost and
                supply
                position, and maintain high utilization of manufacturing assets.
                There can
                be no assurance that such investments and alliances will achieve
                their
                underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial
                to the Company's results of operations or that large capital projects
                for
                such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs

                of
                construction materials and labor.

In
                addition to productivity and cost reduction initiatives, the Company
                is
                striving to improve margins on its products through price increases
                where
                warranted and accepted by the market; however, the company's earnings
                could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized,
                not be
                sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs, or have
                a
                negative impact on demand and volume. There can be no assurances
                that
                price increases will be realized or will be realized within the company's
                anticipated timeframe.


MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

·

The
                Company has undertaken and expects to continue to undertake productivity
                and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings
                to
                improve performance and generate cost savings. There can be no assurance
                that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated
                cost savings from such activities will be
                realized.

·

The
                Company's facilities and businesses are subject to complex health,
                safety
                and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue
                to
                require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such
                laws
                and regulations currently and in the future. The Company's accruals
                for
                such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates
                on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the
                Company’s
                assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site,
                the
                nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory
                agencies
                and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and
                the
                number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.
                Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated
                government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety,
                environmental, chemical control regulations and testing requirements
                could
                result in higher or lower costs.

·

The
                Company and its operations from time to time are parties to or targets
                of
                lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product
                liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property,
                commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety,
                and
                employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary
                course
                of business. The Company believes amounts reserved are adequate for
                such
                pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected
                by
                significant litigation adverse to the
                Company.

·

The
                Company has deferred tax assets related to capital and operating
                losses.
                The Company establishes valuation allowances to reduce these deferred
                tax
                assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
                The
                Company’s ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends on
                projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary
                differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Realization
                of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time.
                As a
                result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable
                income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to
                these
                assets.

·

Due
                to the Company's global sales, earnings, and asset profile, it is
                exposed
                to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
                The
                Company may use derivative financial instruments, including swaps,
                options
                and forwards, to mitigate the impact of changes in exchange rates
                and
                interest rates on its financial results. However, there can be no
                assurance that these efforts will be successful and operating results
                could be affected by significant adverse changes in currency exchange
                rates or interest rates.

The
      foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor
      necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including
      that
      under "Outlook" and "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors," and other
      forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this
      Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere from time to time, represents
      management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company
      does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether
      as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required
      by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company
      disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      or
      in Company press releases) on related subjects.


ITEM
      7A.

QUANTITATIVE
      AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET
      RISK

The
      Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal
      course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well
      as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations.
      To
      mitigate the Company's exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established
      policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of
      financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its
      exposure to such risks.

The
      Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis, which
      measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected
      hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and/or
      commodity prices.

The
      Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its
      borrowing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain
      liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements.
      Currently, these borrowings are predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The
      nature and amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt may vary as
      a
      result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors.
      For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value
      of
      interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the Company uses a one percent absolute
      shift in interest rates. For 2006 and 2005, the market risks associated with
      the
      fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous
      absolute shift in interest rates of 1 percent were approximately $126 million
      and $134 million, respectively. This exposure is primarily related to long-term
      debt with fixed interest rates.

The
      Company's operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies
      are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
      continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market
      conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order
      to
      mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company enters into currency
      options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and
      purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated
      in
      foreign currencies and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm
      commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these
      contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Company's
      policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered
      necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter
      into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes. For 2006, the
      market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies
      assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign
      currency was approximately $20 million and an additional $2.0 million for each
      additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates.
      Furthermore, since the Company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative
      instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in
      fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value
      of the underlying anticipated transactions.

The
      Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major
      raw
      materials and energy. To mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices
      for
      certain commodities, principally propane and natural gas, the Company enters
      into forwards and options contracts. For 2006 and 2005, the market risks
      associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas assuming
      an
      instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent
      were $6 million and $2 million, respectively, and an additional $0.5 million
      for
      each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter for both
      periods.

MANAGEMENT'S

RESPONSIBILITY
      FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management
      is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the accompanying
      consolidated financial statements of Eastman appearing on pages 71 through
      Eastman has prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance
      with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the
      statements of necessity include some amounts that are based on management's
      best
      estimates and judgments.

Eastman's
      accounting systems include extensive internal controls designed to provide
      reasonable assurance of the reliability of its financial records and the proper
      safeguarding and use of its assets. Such controls are based on established
      policies and procedures, are implemented by trained, skilled personnel with
      an
      appropriate segregation of duties, and are monitored through a comprehensive
      internal audit program. The Company's policies and procedures prescribe that
      the
      Company and all employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and
      that
      its business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a manner
      that
      is above reproach.

The
      consolidated financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
      LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who were responsible
      for
      conducting their audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Their report is included
      herein.

The
      Board
      of Directors exercises its responsibility for these financial statements through
      its Audit Committee, which consists entirely of non-management Board members.
      The independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have
      full and free access to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee meets
      periodically with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Eastman's director of internal
      auditing, both privately and with management present, to discuss accounting,
      auditing, policies and procedures, internal controls, and financial reporting
      matters.


REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Eastman
      Chemical Company:

We
      have
      completed integrated audits of Eastman Chemical Company’s consolidated financial
      statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December
      31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States).

Our
      opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
      financial statements

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed

in
      the

index
      appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
      financial position of Eastman Chemical Company and its subsidiaries at December
      31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
      for
      each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity
      with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
      financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
      on
      our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
      the
      standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
      Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
      assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
      misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
      basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
      made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
      We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
      opinion.

As
      discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
      changed the manner in which it accounts for defined-benefit pension and other
      postretirement plans as of December 31, 2006 and as discussed in Note 15 to
      the
      consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which
      it
      accounts for share-based payment as of January 1, 2006.

Internal
      control over financial reporting

Also,
      in
      our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on
      Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
      Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
      December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
      Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
      based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness
      of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
      We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
      accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
      (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
      to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
      financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
      internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
      of
      internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
      testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
      control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
      circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
      opinions.


A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
      (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
      necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
      of
      the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
      and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
      regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
      or
      disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
      financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

      THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SIGNIFICANT
                ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Financial
      Statement Presentation

The
      consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company and subsidiaries
      ("Eastman" or the "Company") are prepared in conformity with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States and of necessity include
      some
      amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. Future actual
      results could differ from such current estimates. The consolidated financial
      statements include assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of all
      majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Eastman accounts for other
      joint
      ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises
      significant influence on the equity basis. Intercompany transactions and
      balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash
      and Cash Equivalents

Cash
      and
      cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities
      with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date.

Accounts
      Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade
      accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
      interest. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
      losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
      The allowances are based on the number of days an individual receivable is
      delinquent and management’s regular assessment of the financial condition of the
      Company’s customers. The Company considers that a receivable is delinquent if it
      is unpaid after the terms of the related invoice have expired. The Company
      evaluates the allowance based on a monthly assessment of the aged receivables.
      Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed
      uncollectible.

Inventories

Inventories
      are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company determines the cost
      of
      most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the
      United States by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method. The cost of all other
      inventories, including inventories outside the United States, is determined
      by
      the average cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out ("FIFO")
      method. The Company writes-down its inventories for estimated obsolescence
      or
      unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of
      inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
      demand and market conditions.

Properties

The
      Company records properties at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
      earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. When Eastman retires
      or
      otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related
      accumulated depreciation from the accounts. The Company records any profit
      or
      loss on retirement or other disposition in earnings. Asset impairments are
      reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation

Depreciation
      expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful lives
      of
      the assets (buildings and building equipment 20 to 50 years; machinery and
      equipment 3 to 33 years), generally using the straight-line method. Accelerated
      depreciation is reported when the estimated useful life is shortened and
      continues to be reported in Cost of Goods Sold.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Computer
      Software Costs

Capitalized
      software costs are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over three
      years, the expected useful life of such assets, beginning when the software
      project is substantially complete and placed in service. Capitalized software
      in
      2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $17 million, $11 million, and $14 million,
      respectively. During those same periods, approximately $13 million, $16 million,
      and $18 million, respectively, of previously capitalized costs were amortized.
      At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the unamortized capitalized software costs were
      $28 million and $24 million, respectively. Capitalized software costs are
      reflected in other noncurrent assets.

Impairment
      of Long Lived Assets

The
      Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including
      definite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances
      indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and
      circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the
      market value of the asset, adverse change in the extent or manner in which
      the
      asset is being used, significant changes in business climate, or current or
      projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets. The carrying
      value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected
      undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less
      than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount
      by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset.
      For
      long-lived assets to be held and used, fair value of fixed (tangible) assets
      and
      definite-lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the
      projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved
      or
      an appraisal. For long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than
      by
      sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values
      are
      reduced for disposal costs.

The
      provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142
      "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require that goodwill and
      indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment
      and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing
      potential future impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill and
      indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value,
      as
      established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain
      related products, is less than their carrying value. The Company conducts its
      annual testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
      in the third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent
      testing.

Investments

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts in which the Company
      is a
      primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, if applicable, or the
      accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest
      is maintained. For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company’s
      ownership is less than 100 percent, the interests of the other stockholders
      are
      included in other long-term liabilities.

Investments
      in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a
      controlling interest are carried on the equity basis. Under the equity method
      of
      accounting, these investments are included in other noncurrent assets. The
      Company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in other
      income and charges and its share of other comprehensive income (loss) in the
      appropriate component of other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) in
      stockholders’ equity.

Marketable
      securities held by the Company, currently common or preferred stock, are deemed
      by management to be available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with
      net
      unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other accumulated
      comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses
      are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification
      method for determining the cost of securities. The Company includes these
      investments in other noncurrent assets.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other
      equity investments, for which fair values are not readily determinable, are
      carried at historical cost and are included in other noncurrent
      assets.

The
      Company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment,
      accounted for by the Company as a marketable security or recorded at historical
      cost, has experienced a decline in value that is other than
      temporary.

Pension
      and Other Post-employment Benefits

The
      Company maintains defined benefit plans that provide eligible employees with
      retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides life insurance and health
      care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees’
eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect
      the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly
      interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase
      for employees, and health care cost trends. The cost of providing plan benefits
      depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover,
      and plan participation.

In
      September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
      No. 158, "Employer's Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
      Postretirement Plans", which changes the accounting for pension and other
      postretirement benefit plans. This Standard was adopted by Eastman for the
      year
      ended December 31, 2006.

For
      additional information, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans".

Environmental
      Costs

The
      Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the
      Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can
      be
      reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but
      the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum
      amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company’s assumptions
      about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the
      remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other
      potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and
      financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the
      estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement
      action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control
      regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower
      costs.

The
      Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated
      with
      the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets include
      but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water
      treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed
      or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to
      be
      associated with the closure of the site

based
      on
      an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory
      closure requirements. These expenses are charged into earnings over the
      estimated useful life of the assets.

Currently,
      the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset up to 50 years.
      If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs
      or
      its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, the expenses to be charged
      into earnings could increase or decrease.

In
      accordance with Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
      Retirement Obligations” ("FIN 47"), the Company also monitors conditional
      obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent
      that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable
      retirement costs.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accruals
      for environmental liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities and
      exclude claims for recoveries from insurance companies or other third parties.
      Environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related
      property, increase its capacity, and/or mitigate or prevent future
      contamination. The cost of operating and maintaining environmental control
      facilities is charged to expense.

The
      Company's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement
      were estimated to be approximately $215 million, $198 million and $184 million
      in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts pertain primarily to
      operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and
      facilities, but also include expenditures for construction and development.
      The
      Company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from
      requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to
      materially increase the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures
      for environmental control facilities.

For
      additional information

see
      Note
      12, "Environmental Matters"

and
      Note
      25, "Reserve Rollforwards".

Derivative
      Financial Instruments

Derivative
      financial instruments are used by the Company in the management of its exposures
      to fluctuations in foreign currency, raw materials and energy costs, and
      interest rates. Such instruments are used to mitigate the risk that changes
      in
      exchange rates or raw materials and energy costs will adversely affect the
      eventual dollar cash flows resulting from the hedged transactions.

The
      Company enters into currency options forwards to hedge probable
      anticipated, but not yet probable committed, export sales and purchase
      transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign
      currencies (principally the Euro, British pound, the Japanese yen and the
      Canadian dollar) and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm
      commitments denominated in foreign currencies. To mitigate short-term
      fluctuations in market prices for propane and natural gas (major raw materials
      and energy used in the manufacturing process), the Company enters into forwards
      and options contracts. From time to time, the Company also utilizes interest
      rate derivative instruments, primarily swaps, to hedge the Company's exposure
      to
      movements in interest rates.

The
      Company's qualifying forwards and options contracts are accounted for as hedges
      because the derivative instruments are designated and effective as hedges and
      reduce the Company's exposure to identified risks. Gains and losses resulting
      from effective hedges of existing assets, liabilities, firm commitments, or
      anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized when the offsetting gains
      and losses are recognized on the related hedged items and are reported as a
      component of operating earnings.

Deferred
      currency option premiums are generally included in other assets. The related
      obligation for payment is generally included in other liabilities and is paid
      in
      the period in which the options are exercised or expire.

Litigation
      and Contingent Liabilities

The
      Company and its operations from time to time are parties to or targets of
      lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability,
      personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial,
      contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters,
      which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company
      accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has
      been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount
      cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range,
      the
      Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including
      those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as
      incurred.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue
      Recognition and Customer Incentives

The
      Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
      delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer
      is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

The
      Company records estimated obligations for customer programs and incentive
      offerings, which consist primarily of revenue or volume-based amounts that
      a
      customer must achieve over a specified period of time, as a reduction of revenue
      to each underlying revenue transaction as the customer progresses toward
      reaching goals specified in incentive agreements. These estimates are based
      on a
      combination of forecast of customer sales and actual sales volumes and revenues
      against established goals, the customer’s current level of purchases, and
      Eastman’s knowledge of customer purchasing habits, and industry pricing
      practice. The incentive payment rate may be variable, based upon the customer
      reaching higher sales volume or revenue levels over a specified period of time
      in order to receive an agreed upon incentive payment.

Shipping
      and Handling Fees and Costs

Shipping
      and handling fees related to sales transactions are billed to customers and
      are
      recorded as sales revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded
      in
      cost of sales.

Restructuring
      of Operations

The
      Company records restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation
      of operations, exited business lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that are
      expected to be substantially completed within a reasonable amount of time.

Share-based
      Compensation

Effective
      January 1, 2006, the Company implemented SFAS No. 123(Revised 2004),
      "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)") and related interpretations and began
      recognizing compensation expense in the financial statements for stock options
      based upon the grant-date fair value over the substantive vesting period. Prior
      to January 1, 2006, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board ("APB")
      Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related
      interpretations, as permitted under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation." Under APB Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense was recognized
      in the financial statements for employee stock options granted at an exercise
      price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at the date
      of
      grant. For additional information, see Note 15, "Share-Based Compensation
      Plans."


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In
      accordance with the implementation requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) under the
      modified prospective method, the Company did not restate prior fiscal periods
      and is required to continue the same disclosure-only requirements of SFAS No.
      123 for comparative purposes until all periods reported are comparable on the
      same basis. The following table illustrates the comparable effect on net
      earnings and earnings per share as formerly provided under SFAS No. 123 for
      and 2004:

All
      costs
      identified as research and development costs are charged to expense when
      incurred with the exception of third-party reimbursed and government-funded
      research and development. Expenses for third-party reimbursed and
      government-funded research and development are deferred until reimbursement
      is
      received to ensure appropriate matching of revenue and expense, provided
      specific criteria are met.

Other
      Income and Other Charges

Included
      in other income and other charges are results from equity investments, gains
      on
      the sale of certain technology business venture investments, royalty income,
      gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions, write-downs to fair value
      of
      certain technology business venture investments due to other than temporary
      declines in value, certain litigation costs, fees on securitized receivables,
      other non-operating income and other miscellaneous items.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income
      Taxes

The
      provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability
      approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes
      represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported
      amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for
      income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus
      the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from
      differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and
      liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes
      are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets
      when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
      Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries
      and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be
      permanently reinvested.

Reclassifications

The
      Company has retrospectively applied certain 2005 and 2004 amounts to conform
      to
      the 2006 presentation. For additional information, see Note 21, "Segment
      Information."

PROPERTIES
                AND ACCUMULATED
                DEPRECIATION

Cumulative
      construction-period interest of $311 million and $352 million, reduced by
      accumulated depreciation of $294 million and $287 million, is included in cost
      of properties at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Interest
      capitalized during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $7 million, $5 million, and $3
      million, respectively.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Depreciation
      expense was $294 million, $287 million, and $302 million for 2006, 2005 and
      2004, respectively. The year

      included $10 million of accelerated depreciation related to previously disclosed
      restructuring decisions in association with cracking units in Longview, Texas,
      and higher cost polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") polymer intermediates assets
      in Columbia, South Carolina, which are scheduled for shutdown.

Deductions
      in 2006 include the sale of certain product lines and related assets in the
      Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI"), the Performance Polymers and
      the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers, and Inks ("CASPI") segments.

EQUITY
                INVESTMENTS AND OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS AND
                LIABILTIES

Eastman
      has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester,
      a
      joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastman's Kingsport,
      Tennessee plant. This investment is accounted for under the equity method.

During
      fourth quarter 2005, t

he
      Company provided a line of credit to the joint venture of up to $125 million,
      which Primester fully utilized to repay the principal amount of the joint
      venture's third-party borrowings, previously guaranteed by Eastman. The Company
      holds an interest-bearing note receivable. Eastman's investment in the joint
      venture at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was approximately $87 million
      and $86 million, respectively, which was comprised of the recognized portion
      of
      the venture's accumulated deficits and the line of credit of $125 million.
      Such
      amount was included in other noncurrent assets.

Eastman
      also owns a 50 percent interest in Nanjing Yangzi Eastman Chemical Ltd.
      (“Nanjing”), a company which manufactures

Eastotac

hydrocarbon tackifying resins for the adhesives market. This joint venture
      is
      accounted for under the equity method and is included in other noncurrent
      assets. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s investment in Nanjing was
      approximately $5 million.

On
      April
      21, 2005, the Company completed the sale of its equity investment in Genencor
      International, Inc. ("Genencor") for cash proceeds of approximately $417
      million, net of $2 million in fees. The book value of the investment prior
      to
      sale was $246 million, and the Company recorded

a
      pre-tax
      gain on the sale of $171 million.

BORROWINGS

At
      December 31, 2006, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S. and
      foreign banks totaling approximately $885 million. These credit facilities
      consist of a $700 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility")
      expiring in April 2011, as well as a 140 million Euro credit facility ("Euro
      Facility") which expires in December 2011. Both credit facilities have options
      for two one-year extensions, and the first extension option for the Euro
      Facility has been exercised

.

Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest at varying
      spreads above quoted market rates. These credit facilities require facility
      fees
      on the total commitment that are based on Eastman’s credit rating. In addition,
      these credit facilities contain a number of covenants and events of default,
      including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2006,
      the
      Company’s credit facility borrowings totaled $185 million at

an
      effective

interest
      rate of 4.00 percent. At December 31, 2005, the Company's credit facility
      borrowings were $214 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.01
      percent.

The
        Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings
        and
        general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper
        borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Since the
        Credit Facility expires in April 2011, any commercial paper borrowings supported
        by the Credit Facility are classified as long-term borrowings because the
        Company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long-term
        basis.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At
      December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding interest
      rate swaps associated with the entire outstanding principle of the 7% notes
      due
      in 2012 and $150 million of the outstanding principle of the 6.30% notes due
      in
      2018 to convert the notes from fixed rate to variable rate borrowings. The
      average variable interest rate on the 7% notes was 7.89

Hedging
      Programs

Financial
      instruments held as part of the hedging programs discussed below are recorded
      at
      fair value based upon comparable market transactions as quoted by the
      broker.

The
      Company is exposed to market risk, such as changes in currency exchange rates,
      raw material and energy costs and interest rates. The Company uses various
      derivative financial instruments pursuant to the Company's hedging policies
      to
      mitigate these market risk factors and their effect on the cash flows of the
      underlying transactions. Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis
      to support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging
      instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the
      cash
      flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The Company does not hold or
      issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Currency
      Rate Hedging

The
      Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout
      the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange
      rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company nets
      the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets.
      To
      manage the remaining exposure, the Company enters into currency options

forwards
      to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet probable committed, export sales
      and
      purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated
      in
      foreign currencies (principally the Euro, British pound, the Japanese yen and
      the Canadian dollar) and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm
      commitments denominated in foreign currencies.

These
      contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The mark-to-market gains or losses
      on qualifying hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
      (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified into sales in the period during
      which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Raw
      Material and Energy Hedging

Raw
      materials and energy sources used by the Company are subject to price volatility
      caused by weather, supply conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable
      factors. To mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for propane and
      natural gas, the Company enters into forwards and options contracts. These
      contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The mark-to-market gains or losses
      on qualifying hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
      (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the
      period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Interest
      Rate Hedging

The
      Company's policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable
      rate debt. To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Company enters
      into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange the difference
      between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed
      upon notional principal amount. These swaps are designated to hedge the fair
      value of underlying debt obligations with the interest rate differential
      reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps.
      As
      these instruments are 100 percent effective, there is no impact on earnings
      due
      to hedge ineffectiveness.

From
      time
      to time, the Company also utilizes interest rate derivative instruments,
      primarily swaps, to hedge the Company’s exposure to movements in interest rates
      on anticipated debt offerings. These instruments are designated as cash flow
      hedges and are typically 100 percent effective. As a result, there is no current
      impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. The mark-to-market gains or
      losses on these hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
      (loss) to the extent effective, and are reclassified into interest expense
      over
      the period of the related debt instruments.

At
      December 31, 2006, mark-to-market losses from raw material, currency, energy
      and
      certain interest rate hedges that were included in accumulated other
      comprehensive income (loss) totaled approximately $7 million. If
      realized, substantially all of these losses will be reclassified into
      earnings during the next 12 months. The mark-to-market gains or losses on
      non-qualifying, excluded and ineffective portions of hedges are immediately
      recognized in cost of sales or other income and charges. Such amounts had a
      negative $1 million impact on earnings during 2006.

At
      December 31, 2005, mark-to-market losses from raw material, currency, energy
      and
      certain interest rate hedges that were included in accumulated other
      comprehensive income (loss) totaled approximately $5 million. If
      realized, substantially all of these losses will be reclassified into
      earnings during the next 12 months. The mark-to-market gains or losses on
      non-qualifying, excluded and ineffective portions of hedges are immediately
      recognized in cost of sales or other income and charges. Such amounts had a
      negative $6 million impact on earnings during 2005.

RETIREMENT
                PLANS

Eastman
      maintains defined benefit plans that provide eligible employees with retirement
      benefits. Prior to 2000, benefits were calculated using a defined benefit
      formula based on age, years of service, and the employee’s final average
      compensation as defined in the plans. Effective January 1, 2000, the Company's
      U.S. defined benefit pension plan, the Eastman Retirement Assistance Plan,
      was
      amended. Employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to January 1, 2000
      are
      calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age, years
      of
      service and final average compensation as defined in the plans. The amended
      defined benefit pension plan uses a pension equity formula based on age, years
      of service and final average compensation to calculate an employee's retirement
      benefits from January 1, 2000 forward. Benefits payable will be the combined
      pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits.

Benefits
      are paid to employees from trust funds. Contributions to the plan are made
      as
      permitted by laws and regulations. The pension trust fund does not directly
      own
      any of the Company’s common stock.

Pension
      coverage for employees of Eastman's international operations is provided, to
      the
      extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The Company systematically
      provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees,
      under insurance policies or by book reserves.

Eastman
      has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined
      Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statement
      No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R)" ("SFAS No. 158"), as of December 31, 2006. The
      table below summarizes the incremental effects of SFAS No. 158 adoption on

The
      Company’s investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to
      maximize long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level
      of
      risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. The investment
      policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the fund
      is managed within those ranges. The plans use a number of investment approaches
      including equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying
      securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. The U.S.
      plan also invests in private equity and other funds.

The
      expected rate of return was determined by modeling the expected long-term rates
      of return for broad categories of investments held by the plan against a number
      of various potential economic scenarios.

The
      Company funded its U.S. defined benefit plan for 2007 by $100 million in January
      2007.

Benefits
      expected to be paid from pension plans are as follows:

      plans. This change will not impact net periodic benefit cost in 2006 and will
      begin to impact the financial statements in first quarter 2007.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DEFINED
      CONTRIBUTION PLANS

The
      Company sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the
      "ESOP"), a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,
      which is a component of the Eastman Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
      Plan ("EIP/ESOP"). Eastman anticipates that it will make annual contributions
      for substantially all U.S. employees equal to 5 percent of eligible compensation
      to the ESOP, or for employees who have five or more prior ESOP contributions,
      to
      either the Eastman Stock Fund or other investment funds within the EIP.
      Employees may diversify to other investment funds within the EIP from the ESOP
      at any time without restrictions. Allocated shares in the ESOP totaled
      1,721,199; 1,980,906; and 2,210,590 shares as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and
      2004, respectively. Dividends on shares held by the EIP/ESOP are charged to
      retained earnings. All shares held by the EIP/ESOP are treated as outstanding
      in
      computing earnings per share.

In
      July
      2006, the Company amended its EIP/ESOP to provide a company match of 50 percent
      of the first 7 percent of an employee's compensation contributed to the plan
      for
      employees who are hired on or after January 1, 2007. Employees who are hired
      on
      or after January 1, 2007, will also be eligible for the 5 percent contribution
      to the ESOP as described above.

Charges
      for domestic contributions to the EIP/ESOP were $35 million, $33 million, and
      $34 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT
      WELFARE PLANS

Eastman
      provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees, and
      health care benefits for retirees' eligible survivors. In general, Eastman
      provides those benefits to retirees eligible under the Company's U.S. pension
      plans. Similar benefits are also provided to retirees of Holston Defense
      Corporation (“HDC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that, prior to
      January 1, 1999, operated a government-owned ammunitions plant. HDC’s contract
      with the Department of Army (“DOA”) provided for reimbursement of allowable
      costs incurred by HDC including certain postretirement welfare costs, for as
      long as HDC operated the plant. After the contract was terminated at the end
      of
      1998, the Army did not contribute further to these costs. The Company pursued
      extraordinary relief from the DOA and was granted an award effective in the
      fourth quarter in the amount of $95 million. This award was for reimbursement
      of
      the described costs and other previously expensed post-retirement benefit costs.
      The Company began recognizing the impact of the reimbursement in fourth quarter
      2006 by recording an unrecognized gain and amortizing the gain into earnings
      over a period of time.

Included
      in 2006 other income is a $12 million gain

reflecting
      a portion of the unrecognized gain resulting from the award.

Eastman
      has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006 for its
      postretirement welfare plans with the implementation having an immaterial
      impact.

A

      is
      assumed for 2007. The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 5 percent for
      2011 and remain at that level thereafter. A 1 percent increase or decrease
      in
      health care trend would have had no material impact on the 2006 service and
      interest costs or the 2006 benefit obligation, because the Company's
      contributions for benefits are fixed.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During
      the second quarter 2004, the Company announced an amendment to its U.S. health
      and dental benefit plans such that future health and dental benefits to certain
      retirees will be fixed at a certain contribution amount, not to be increased.
      As
      a result, the Company remeasured these plans as of June 1, 2004 resulting in
      a
      reduction of the Company’s benefit obligation by approximately $240 million. The
      discount rate used at the time of the remeasurement was adjusted from 6.25
      percent at December 31, 2003 to 6.50 percent at June 1, 2004 based on increases
      in interest rates.

In
      May,
      2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") 106-2, providing final
      guidance on accounting for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
      Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). Under the provisions of FSP 106-2, the
      Company determined that its health care plans were not actuarially equivalent
      to
      Medicare Part D. In January, 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
      Services released final regulations implementing the Act. The Company has
      determined that, although its plans are believed to be actuarially equivalent
      and eligible for certain subsidies under the most recent regulations,
      implementation of these regulations will have an immaterial impact on its
      overall financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and therefore
      are not reflected in the above amounts.

In
      July
      2006, the Company announced plans to change its U.S. life insurance and health
      care benefit plans such that employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 will
      have access to post-retirement health care benefits only, while Eastman will
      not
      provide a company contribution toward the premium cost of post-retirement
      benefits for those employees. This change will begin to impact the financial
      statements in first quarter 2007.

COMMITMENTS

Purchase
      Obligations and Lease Commitments

At
      December 31, 2006, the Company had various purchase obligations totaling
      approximately $2.1 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for
      materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
      The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under
      cancelable, noncancelable, and month-to-month operating leases totaling
      approximately $201 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease
      commitments, approximately 12 percent relate to machinery and equipment,
      including computer and communications equipment and production equipment;
      approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space,
      storage facilities and land; and approximately 38 percent relate to railcars.
      Rental expense, net of sublease income, was approximately $62 million, $64
      million, and $65 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The
      obligations described above are summarized in the following table:

        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accounts
      Receivable Securitization Program

In
      1999,
      the Company entered into an agreement that allows the Company to sell certain
      domestic accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third
      party. The agreement permits the sale of undivided interests in domestic trade
      accounts receivable. Receivables sold to the third party totaled $200 million
      at
      December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Undivided interests in designated
      receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the
      purchased interest in the receivable pools. Average monthly proceeds from
      collections reinvested in the continuous sale program were approximately $321
      million and $292 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Guarantees

In
      November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”), “Guarantor’s
      Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
      Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” an interpretation of FASB Statements
      No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34.” FIN
      45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
      Contingencies,” relating to the guarantor’s accounting for, and disclosure of,
      the issuance of certain types of guarantees. Disclosures about each group of
      similar guarantees are provided below.

Residual
      Value Guarantees

If
      certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion
      of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of
      the
      related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees
      at
      December 31, 2006 totaled $113 million and consisted primarily of leases for
      railcars, company aircraft, and other equipment.

Leases
      with guarantee amounts totaling $2 million, $27 million, and $84 million will
      expire in 2007, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

The
      Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood
      of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote.

Other
      Guarantees

Guarantees
      and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships
      with suppliers, customers and non-consolidated affiliates when the Company
      undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified
      triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract could trigger an
      obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon
      alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters,
      and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results
      is
      not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists
      as
      to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities
      resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the
      period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material
      adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
      liquidity.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Variable
      Interest Entities

The
      Company has evaluated material relationships including the guarantees related
      to
      the third-party borrowings of joint ventures described above and has concluded
      that the entities are not Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) or, in the case of
      Primester, a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company's
      Kingsport, Tennessee plant, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the
      VIE. As such, in accordance with

FASB

Interpretation
      Number 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"

("FIN
      46R"), the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. In addition,
      the Company has evaluated long-term purchase obligations with two entities
      that
      may be VIEs at December 31, 2006. These potential VIEs are joint ventures from
      which the Company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years
      and purchases approximately $60 million of raw materials and utilities on an
      annual basis. The Company has no equity interest in these entities and has
      confirmed that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate the
      potential VIE. However, due to competitive and other reasons, the Company has
      not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether
      the entities are VIEs, and if one or both are VIEs, whether or not the Company
      is the primary beneficiary.

ENVIRONMENTAL
                MATTERS

Certain
      Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the
      treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by
      various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various
      hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been
      designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP"), by the U.S. Environmental
      Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
      and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several
      liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required
      to
      incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under
      the
      federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental
      contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman’s policies
      described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies". Because of expected
      sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Company’s
      preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, management does not
      believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters,
      individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company’s consolidated
      financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company’s reserve
      for environmental contingencies was $47 million and $51 million at December
      31,
      2006 and 2005, respectively, representing the minimum or best estimate for
      remediation costs and the best estimate accrued to date over the facilities'
      estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs. Estimated future
      environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or
      best
      estimate of $18 million to the maximum of $32 million at December 31, 2006
      and
      the minimum or best estimate of $21 million to the maximum of $42 million at
      December 31, 2005.

The
      following table summarizes the activity in the Company's accrued obligations
      for
      environmental matters for the years ended December 31, 2006 and

LEGAL
                MATTERS

General

From
      time
      to time, the Company and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits,
      claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal
      injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract,
      environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which
      are
      being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the Company
      is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based
      upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending
      matters, including the sorbates litigation and the asbestos litigation
      (described below), will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial
      condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, adverse developments
      could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in a particular future period.

Sorbates
      Litigation

Two
      civil
      cases relating to sorbates remain. In each case, the Company prevailed at the
      trial court, and in each case, the plaintiff appealed the trial court's
      decision. In one case, the appeal is still pending. In the other case, the
      court
      of appeals overturned the trial court's decision and ruled that the plaintiff
      could amend and re-file its complaint with the trial court. The Company has
      appealed this court of appeals decision to the state supreme court. In each
      case
      the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.

Asbestos
      Litigation

Over
      the
      years, Eastman has been named as a defendant, along with numerous other
      defendants, in lawsuits in various state courts in which plaintiffs have alleged
      injury due to exposure to asbestos at Eastman’s manufacturing sites. More
      recently, certain plaintiffs have claimed exposure to an asbestos-containing
      plastic, which Eastman manufactured in limited amounts between the mid-1960’s
      and the early 1970’s.

To
      date,
      the Company has obtained dismissals or settlements of its asbestos-related
      lawsuits with no material effect on its financial condition, results of
      operations or cash flows, and over the past several years, has substantially
      reduced its number of pending asbestos-related claims. The Company has also
      obtained insurance coverage that applies to a portion of certain of the
      Company’s defense costs and payments of settlements or judgments in connection
      with asbestos-related lawsuits.

Based
      on
      an ongoing evaluation, the Company believes that the resolution of its pending
      asbestos claims will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
      condition, results of operations, or cash flows, although these matters could
      result in the Company being subject to monetary damages, costs or expenses,
      and
      charges against earnings in particular periods.

      of
      which 50 million may be preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 350

      dividends of $1.76 per share in each of 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The
      Company established a benefit security trust in 1997 to provide a degree of
      financial security for unfunded obligations under certain plans and contributed
      to the trust a warrant to purchase up to 1 million shares of common stock of
      the
      Company for par value. The warrant, which remains outstanding, is exercisable
      by
      the trustee if the Company does not meet certain funding obligations, which
      obligations would be triggered by certain occurrences, including a change in
      control or potential change in control, as defined, or failure by the Company
      to
      meet its payment obligations under covered unfunded plans. Such warrant is
      excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
      conditions upon which the warrant becomes exercisable have not been
      met.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
      additions to paid-in capital for 2005 and 2004 are primarily the result of
      stock
      option exercises by employees. Effective January 1, 2006, this includes
      exercises and recognition of compensation expense of equity awards determined
      under SFAS No. 123(R).

The
      Company was authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of its common stock
      under a February 4, 1999, authorization by the Board of Directors. No shares
      of
      Eastman common stock were repurchased by the Company under this authorization
      during 2006, 2005, and 2004.

A
      total
      of 2,746,869 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $112 million,
      or
      an average price of approximately $41 per share, have been repurchased under
      the
      authorization.

Repurchased
      shares under this authorization may be used to meet common stock requirements
      for compensation and benefit plans and other corporate purposes.

      February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors cancelled its prior authorization
      for
      stock repurchases and approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up
      to
      $300 million of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such
      amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the
      Company. Repurchased shares may be used for such purposes or otherwise applied
      in such a manner as determined to be in the best interests of the
      Company.

The
      Company's charitable foundation held the following shares of the Company's
      common stock at December 31 of each year and are reported in treasury stock:
      106,771 shares for 2006 and 2005 and 122,725 shares for 2004.

During
      the fourth quarter of 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company redeemed
      all
      of the outstanding preferred stock purchase rights issuable pursuant to the
      Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement and terminated the Stockholder
      Protection Rights Agreement. The payment of $0.01 per share of common stock
      was
      recorded in dividends payable at December 31, 2006 and was paid January 2,
      2007.

For
      2006,
      2005, and 2004, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used
      to
      compute basic earnings per share was 82.1 million, 80.7 million, and 77.6
      million, respectively, and for diluted earnings per share was 83.2 million,
      81.8
      million, and 78.3 million, respectively, reflecting the effect of dilutive
      options outstanding. Excluded from the 2006 calculation were shares underlying
      options to purchase 2,157,703 shares of common stock at a range of prices from
      $53.94 to $63.25, because the exercise price of the options was greater than
      the
      average market price of the underlying common shares. Excluded from the 2005
      calculation were shares underlying options to purchase 878,442 shares of common
      stock at a range of prices from $54.25 to $67.50, because the exercise price
      of
      the options was greater than the average market price of the underlying common
      shares. Excluded from the 2004 calculation were shares underlying options to
      purchase 5,667,339 shares of common stock at a range of prices from $45.44
      to
      $67.50, because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average
      market price of the underlying common shares.

SHARE-BASED
                COMPENSATION PLANS AND
                AWARDS

      Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan

Eastman's
      2002 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan provides for grants to employees of
      nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, tandem and freestanding
      stock appreciation rights (“SAR’s”), performance shares and various other stock
      and stock-based awards. The 2002 Omnibus Plan provides that options can be
      granted through May 2, 2007, for the purchase of Eastman common stock at an
      option price not less than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on
      the
      date of the stock option's grant. There is a maximum of 7.5 million shares
      of
      common stock available for option grants and other awards during the term of
      the
      2002 Omnibus Plan.

Director
      Long-Term Compensation Plan

Eastman's
      2002 Director Long-Term Compensation Plan provides for grants of nonqualified
      stock options and restricted shares to nonemployee members of the Board of
      Directors. Shares of restricted stock are granted upon the first day of the
      directors' initial term of service and nonqualified stock options and shares
      of
      restricted stock are granted each year following the annual meeting of
      stockholders. The 2002 Director Plan provides that options can be granted
      through the later of May 1, 2007, or the date of the annual meeting of
      stockholders in 2007 for the purchase of Eastman common stock at an option
      price
      not less than the stock's fair market value on the date of the grant.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Adoption
      of SFAS No. 123(R)

On
      January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) replaces
      SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" and supersedes APB
      No.
      25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and amends SFAS No. 95,
      "Statement of Cash Flows". Prior to adoption, the Company implemented the
      disclosure-only requirements of SFAS No. 123 and continued to implement the
      requirements of APB No. 25 for financial statement reporting. Under the
      requirements of APB No. 25, the Company was required to recognize compensation
      cost for share-based awards when the employee or non-employee director paid
      an
      amount to acquire the awarded shares that was less than the closing market
      price
      of the stock at the measurement date (typically the date of grant). This
      requirement resulted in compensation expense recognition and reporting in the
      financial statements for most share-based awards (unrestricted stock awards,
      restricted stock awards, long-term performance stock awards and stock
      appreciation rights) except for stock options, substantially all of which were
      awarded at the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date
      of
      grant. Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), compensation expense related
      to stock option awards are recognized in the financial statements at their
      fair
      value.

The
      Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method that
      requires compensation expense of all employee and non-employee director
      share-based compensation awards to be recognized in the financial statements
      based upon their grant date fair value over the requisite service or vesting
      period: a) based upon the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all new awards
      granted after the effective date of implementation and b) based upon the
      requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted prior to the effective
      date
      of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date.

In
      November 2005, the FASB also issued FSP No. 123(R) - 3, "Transition Election
      Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards." The
      FSP provides an elective alternative transition method to the prescribed method
      in SFAS No. 123(R) for calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available
      to
      absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No.
      123(R). The Company determined it did not have all the data necessary to compute
      the pool of excess tax benefits as described in SFAS No 123(R) and has elected
      to follow the alternative method prescribed under SFAS No. 123(R) - 3. Based
      upon the alternative method, the Company does not have a pool of excess tax
      benefits at December 31, 2005 to offset tax shortfalls and, consequently, will
      record them as current period income tax expense.

The
      Company is authorized by the Board of Directors under the 2002 Omnibus Long-Term
      Compensation Plan and 2002 Director Long-Term Compensation Plan to provide
      grants to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. It
      has
      been the Company's practice to issue new shares rather than treasury shares
      for
      equity awards that require payment by the issuance of common stock and to
      withhold or accept back shares awarded necessary to cover the income taxes
      of
      employee participants. Shares of non-employee directors are not withheld or
      acquired for the withholding of their income taxes. Shares of unrestricted
      common stock owned by specified senior management level employees are accepted
      by the Company to pay for the exercise price of stock option exercises in
      accordance with the terms and conditions of their awards.

For
      2006,
      2005 and 2004, total share-based compensation expense (before tax) of
      approximately $29 million, $22 million and $16 million, respectively, was
      recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated
      statement of earnings, comprehensive income, and retained earnings for all
      share-based awards of which approximately $17 million, $5 million and $8
      million, respectively, related to stock options. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that
      compensation expense is recognized over the substantive vesting period, which
      may be a shorter time period than the stated vesting period. For example, SFAS
      No. 123(R) requires compensation expense to be recognized by the retirement
      eligibility date for option participants who are retirement eligible on the
      grant date or before the stated vesting period. Approximately $8 million of
      option compensation expense is recognized due to retirement eligibility
      preceding the requisite vesting period.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stock
      Option Awards

Option
      awards are granted to non-employee directors on an annual basis and to employees
      who meet certain eligibility requirements. A single annual option grant is
      usually awarded to eligible employees in the fourth quarter of each year, if
      and
      when granted by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the
      Board of Directors, and occasional individual grants are awarded to eligible
      employees throughout the year. Option awards have an exercise price equal to
      the
      closing price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. The term of options
      is ten years with vesting periods that vary up to three years. Vesting usually
      occurs ratably or at the end of the vesting period. SFAS No. 123(R) requires
      that stock option awards be valued at fair value determined by market price,
      if
      actively traded in a public market or, if not, calculated using an option
      pricing financial model. The fair value of the Company's options cannot be
      determined by market value as they are not traded in an open market.
      Accordingly, a financial pricing model is utilized to determine fair value.
      The
      Company utilizes the Black Scholes Merton ("BSM") model which relies on certain
      assumptions to estimate an option's fair value.

The
      weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock
      options awarded in 2006, 2005 and 2004 are provided in the table below:

Prior
      to
      adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company calculated the expected term of stock
      options of six years. Effective with the fourth quarter 2005 annual option
      award, the Company analyzed historical annual grant transactions over a ten
      year
      period comprising exercises, post-vesting cancellations and expirations to
      determine the expected term. The Company expects to execute this analysis each
      year preceding the annual option grant to ensure that all assumptions based
      upon
      internal data reflect the most reasonable expectations for fair value
      determination. The weighted average expected term of 4.4 years for 2006 reflects
      the impact of this annual analysis and the weighting of option swap and reload
      grants which may have much shorter expected terms than new option grants.

The
      volatility rate of grants is derived from historical Company common stock
      volatility over the same time period as the expected term. The Company uses
      a
      weekly high closing stock price based upon daily closing prices in the week.
      The
      volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high
      closing price data.

For
      the
      periods presented above, the expected dividend yield is derived by mathematical
      formula which uses the expected Company annual dividend amount over the expected
      term divided by the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the
      grant
      date.

The
      average risk-free interest rate is derived from United States Department of
      Treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period
      as the expected term.

Prior
      to
      adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company did not estimate forfeitures and
      recognized them as they occurred for proforma disclosure of share-based
      compensation expense. With adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), estimated forfeitures
      must be considered in recording share-based compensation expense. Estimated
      forfeiture rates vary with each type of award affected by several factors,
      one
      of which is the varying composition and characteristics of the award
      participants. Estimated forfeitures for the Company's share-based awards
      historically range from 0.75 percent to 10.0 percent with the estimated
      forfeitures for options at 0.75 percent.

      return on capital and total shareholder return compared to a peer group ranking
      by total shareholder return. The recognized compensation cost before tax for
      these other share-based awards in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
      2004 is approximately $12 million, $17 million and $7 million, respectively.
      The
      unrecognized compensation expense before tax for these same awards at December
      31, 2006 is $13 million and will be recognized over a period of approximately
      three years.

Impairments
      and restructuring charges totaled $206 million during 2004, consisting of
      non-cash asset impairments of $140 million and restructuring charges of $66
      million.

The
      following table summarizes the 2006, 2005 and 2004 charges:


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


In
      the
      fourth quarter 2006, the Company recorded asset impairments and restructuring
      charges of $78 million, consisting of non-cash impairments of $42 million and
      restructuring charges of $36 million; and other operating income of $68 million.
      The asset impairments consisted of approximately $20 million related to the
      previously reported shutdown of the cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM")
      manufacturing assets in San Roque, Spain, utilized in the SP and the Performance
      Polymers segments and $22 million primarily related to the shutdown of a
      research and development pilot plant in the Performance Polymers segment. The
      decisions to shutdown the San Roque, Spain site to gain operational efficiencies
      at other facilities and to shutdown the research and development pilot plant
      were made in fourth quarter 2006. The restructuring charges consisted of $33
      million of estimated severance primarily related to work force reductions and
      $3
      million of other charges.

In
      the
      third quarter 2006, asset impairments and restructuring charges totaled $13
      million. During the third quarter 2006, the Company classified the Batesville,
      Arkansas manufacturing facility as an asset group held for sale and recorded
      a
      related $11 million impairment charge to reduce the recorded book value of
      the
      assets to the contracted sales price.

In
      the
      second quarter 2006, asset impairments and restructuring charges totaled $3
      million, relating primarily to previously closed manufacturing
      facilities.

In
      the
      first quarter 2006, asset impairments and restructuring charges totaled $7
      million, relating primarily to the divestiture of a previously closed
      manufacturing facility.


During
      2005, the Company recorded $33 million in restructuring charges. These charges
      consist of approximately $8 million of fixed asset impairments related to the
      Company's PCI manufacturing facilities outside the United States, $14 million
      in
      restructuring charges related to the shutdown of Cendian Corporation
      ("Cendian"), the Company's logistics subsidiary, $4 million of fixed and
      intangible asset impairments related to the Company's other category, $3 million
      in severance charges related to the separation of approximately 90 employees
      at
      the Company's Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility, and $4 million in
      site closure costs related to the previously announced closures of certain
      manufacturing facilities.


In
      the
      fourth quarter 2004, the Company recorded restructuring charges of approximately
      $18 million, consisting of asset impairments of $9 million and site closure
      and
      other restructuring charges of $9 million. The non-cash asset impairments relate
      to the adjustment to fair value of assets at Cendian, impacting the other
      category, resulting from a decision to reintegrate Cendian’s logistics
      activities. In addition, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $9
      million primarily related to actual and expected severance of Cendian and other
      employees, as well as site closure charges primarily related to previously
      announced manufacturing plant closures.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In
      the
      third quarter 2004, the Company recognized restructuring charges of
      approximately $42 million, including asset impairments of approximately $28
      million, for assets at the Company’s Batesville, Arkansas and Longview, Texas
      manufacturing facilities. These impairments primarily related to certain fixed
      assets in the performance chemicals product lines in the PCI segment that
      management decided to rationalize due to increased foreign competition. Also
      in
      third quarter, the CASPI segment

incurred
      approximately $2 million in site closure charges primarily related to previously
      announced manufacturing plant closures, while the other category recognized
      approximately $4 million in severance and restructuring charges related to
      the
      reorganization of Cendian. Severance charges of $2 million, $3 million, $2
      million, and $1 million were also recognized in the CASPI, PCI, SP, and Polymers
      segments, respectively. These charges resulted from the Company's voluntary
      termination program as well as ongoing cost reduction efforts.

In
      the
      second quarter 2004, the Company recognized $79 million in restructuring
      charges, including asset impairments of $62 million related to assets held
      for
      sale. The assets were part of the Company’s sale of certain businesses and
      product lines within the CASPI segment, which was completed July 31, 2004.
      Those
      product lines include: certain acrylic monomers; composites (unsaturated
      polyester resins); inks and graphic arts raw materials; liquid resins; powder
      resins; and textile chemicals. The charges reflect adjustment of the recorded
      values of these assets to the expected sales proceeds. Also in second quarter
      2004, the Company recognized an additional $4 million of site closure costs
      related primarily to previously announced manufacturing plant closures. These
      charges had an impact of approximately $2 million each to the CASPI and SP
      segments. Severance charges of $5 million, $4 million, $2 million, and $1
      million were also recognized in the CASPI, PCI, SP, and Polymers segments,
      respectively, and $1 million in the other category. These charges resulted
      from
      the Company's voluntary termination program as well as ongoing cost reduction
      efforts.

In
      the
      first quarter 2004, the Company recognized $67 million in restructuring charges,
      including approximately $40 million of asset impairments and $5 million of
      severance charges primarily related to the closure of its copolyester
      manufacturing facility in Hartlepool, United Kingdom. The decision to close
      the
      Hartlepool site, which manufactured products that are within the Company’s SP
      segment’s product lines, was made in order to consolidate production at other
      sites to create a more integrated and efficient global manufacturing structure.
      Accordingly, the carrying value of the manufacturing fixed assets was written
      down to fair value as established by appraisal and available market data. In
      addition, the Company recognized $1 million of fixed asset impairments and
      $1
      million of site closure costs related to additional impairments within the
      CASPI
      reorganization and changes in estimates for previously accrued amounts.
      Severance charges of $4 million, $3 million, $1 million, and $11 million were
      also recognized in the CASPI, PCI, SP, and Polymers segments, respectively,
      and
      $1 million in the other category as a result of ongoing cost reduction
      efforts.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
      following table summarizes the charges and changes in estimates described above,
      other asset impairments and restructuring charges, the non-cash reductions
      attributable to asset impairments, and the cash reductions in shutdown reserves
      for severance costs and site closure costs paid:

A
      majority of all severance and site closure costs are expected to be applied
      to
      the reserves within one year.

Actual
      and probable separations totaled approximately 400 employees during 2006. As
      of
      the end of 2006, no separations accrued for were completed. Actual and probable
      separations totaled approximately 90 employees during 2005. As of the end of
      2005, substantially all separations accrued for were completed. Actual and
      probable separations totaled approximately 1,200 employees during 2004. As
      of
      the end of 2004, substantially all separations accrued for were completed.

INCOME
                TAXES

Components

      and
      other income taxes follow:


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
      following represents the deferred tax charge (benefit) recorded as a component
      of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’
equity.

Differences
      between the provision (benefit) for income taxes and income taxes computed
      using
      the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate follow:

The
      effective tax rate was impacted by a net of $25 million of deferred tax benefit
      resulting from the reversal of capital loss carryforward valuation reserves
      and
      $11 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the reversal of foreign
      net
      operating loss valuation reserves.

The
      effective tax rate was impacted by a $11 million tax charge resulting from
      the
      repatriation of $321 million of foreign earnings and capital pursuant to
      provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("Jobs Act"). The Jobs
      Act
      created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
      income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction
      for
      certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.

The
      effective tax rate was impacted by $90 million of deferred tax benefits
      resulting from the expected utilization of a capital loss resulting from the
      sale of certain businesses and product lines and related assets in the CASPI
      segment and $26 million of tax benefit resulting from the favorable resolution
      of a prior year capital loss refund claim.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
      significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities
      follow:

Unremitted
      earnings of subsidiaries outside the United States, considered to be reinvested
      indefinitely, totaled $275 million at December 31, 2006. It is not practicable
      to determine the deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to
      those unremitted earnings.

For
      certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, income and losses directly flow
      through to taxable income in the United States. These entities are also subject
      to taxation in the foreign tax jurisdictions. Net operating loss carryforwards
      exist to offset future taxable income in foreign tax jurisdictions and valuation
      allowances are provided to reduce deferred related tax assets if it is more
      likely than not that this benefit will not be realized. Changes in the estimated
      realizable amount of deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses
      for these entities could result in changes in the deferred tax asset valuation
      allowance in the foreign tax jurisdiction. At the same time, because these
      entities are also subject to tax in the United States, a deferred tax liability
      for the expected future taxable income will be established concurrently.
      Therefore, the impact of any reversal of valuation allowances on consolidated
      income tax expense will only be to the extent that there are differences between
      the United States statutory tax rate and the tax rate in the foreign
      jurisdiction. A valuation allowance of $74 million at December 31, 2006, has
      been provided against the deferred tax asset resulting from these operating
      loss
      carryforwards.

At
      December 31, 2006, foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaled $413
      million. Of this total, $285 million will expire in 3 to 15 years; and $128
      million will never expire.

SEGMENT
                INFORMATION

The
      Company's products and operations are managed and reported in five reportable
      operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the
      PCI
      segment, the Performance Polymers segment and the SP segment

.
      The
      Company's segments were previously aligned in a divisional structure that
      provided for goods and services to be transferred between divisions at
      predetermined prices that may have been in excess of cost, which resulted in
      the
      recognition of intersegment sales revenue and operating earnings. Such
      interdivisional transactions were eliminated in the Company's consolidated
      financial statements. In first quarter 2006, the Company realigned its
      organizational structure to support its growth strategy and to better reflect
      the integrated nature of the Company's assets. A result of the realigned
      organizational structure is that goods and services are transferred among the
      segments at cost. As part of this change, the Company's segment results have
      been restated to eliminate the impact of interdivisional sales revenue and
      operating earnings.

In
      the
      first quarter of 2006, management determined that the Developing Businesses
      ("DB") segment is not of continuing significance for financial reporting
      purposes. As a result, revenues and costs previously included in the DB segment
      and research and development expenses not identifiable to an operating segment
      are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods
      presented and are shown in the tables below as "other" revenues and operating
      losses.

The
      CASPI
      segment manufactures raw materials, additives and specialty polymers, primarily
      for the paints and coatings, inks, and adhesives markets. The CASPI segment's
      products consist of liquid vehicles, coatings additives, and hydrocarbon resins
      and rosins and rosin esters. Liquid vehicles, such as ester, ketone and alcohol
      solvents, maintain the binders in liquid form for ease of application. Coatings
      additives, such as cellulosic polymers,

Texanol

ester
      alcohol and chlorinated polyolefins, enhance the rheological, film formation
      and
      adhesion properties of paints, coatings and inks. Hydrocarbon resins and rosins
      and rosin esters are used in adhesive, ink, and polymers compounding
      applications. Additional products are developed in response to, or in
      anticipation of, new applications where the Company believes significant value
      can be achieved. On November 30, 2006, t

he
      Company sold its

Epolene

polymer
      businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
      Fibers segment manufactures

Estron

acetate
      tow and

Estrobond

triacetin plasticizers which are used primarily in cigarette filters;

Estron

and

Chromspun

acetate
      yarns for use in apparel, home furnishings and industrial fabrics; acetate
      flake
      for use by other acetate tow producers; and acetyl chemicals.

The
      PCI
      segment manufactures diversified products that are used in a variety of markets
      and industrial and consumer applications, including chemicals for agricultural
      intermediates, fibers, food and beverage ingredients, photographic chemicals,
      pharmaceutical intermediates, polymer compounding and chemical manufacturing
      intermediates. In fourth quarter 2006,

the
      Company sold its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing facility and related assets
      and the specialty organic chemicals product lines.

The
      Performance Polymers segment manufactures and supplies PET polymers for use
      primarily in beverage and food packaging, including carbonated soft drinks,
      water, juices, sports drinks, beer and food containers that are suitable for
      both conventional and microwave oven use. The Performance Polymers segment
      also
      manufactured low-density PE and linear low-density PE, which were used primarily
      in extrusion coating, film and molding applications. These PE product lines
      were
      divested in fourth quarter, 2006 along with

related
      assets and the Company's ethylene pipeline.

The
      SP
      segment’s key products include engineering and specialty polymers, specialty
      film and sheet products, and packaging film and fiber products. Included in
      these are highly specialized copolyesters and cellulosic plastics that possess
      unique performance properties for value-added end uses such as appliances,
      store
      fixtures and displays, building and construction, electronic packaging, medical
      packaging, personal care and cosmetics, performance films, tape and labels,
      fiber, photographic and optical film, graphic arts, and general
      packaging.

In
      fourth
      quarter 2006, certain product lines were transferred from the PCI segment to
      the
      Performance Polymers segment. During 2005 and 2004, these amounts were included
      within the PCI segment. Accordingly, the prior year's amounts for sales and
      operating earnings have been adjusted to retrospectively apply these changes
      to
      all periods presented.

RECENTLY
                ISSUED ACCOUNTING
                STANDARDS

In
      February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
      Financial Instruments,” an amendment of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers
      and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities." SFAS
      No.
      155 simplifies accounting for certain hybrid instruments under SFAS No. 133
      by
      permitting fair value remeasurement for financial instruments containing an
      embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155
      eliminates both the previous restriction under SFAS No. 140 on passive
      derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity may hold and
      SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to
      Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets,” which provides that
      beneficial interests are not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 133. SFAS
      No.
      155 also establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
      financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or
      that
      are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
      bifurcation, and clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
      subordination are not imbedded derivatives. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all
      financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event
      occurring after the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after
      September 15, 2006. The Company has evaluated the effect of SFAS No. 155 and
      determined that it does not expect a material impact from the adoption to its
      consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results from
      operations

In
      March
      2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial
      Assets,” an amendment of SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 156 permits entities to choose
      to either subsequently measure servicing rights at fair value and report changes
      in fair value in earnings or amortize servicing rights in proportion to and
      over
      the estimated net servicing income or loss and assess to rights for impairment
      or the need for an increased obligation. SFAS No. 156 also clarifies when a
      servicer should separately recognize servicing assets and liabilities; requires
      all separately recognized assets and liabilities to be initially measured at
      fair value, if practicable; permits a one-time reclassification of
      available-for-sales securities to trading securities by an entity with
      recognized servicing rights and requires additional disclosures for all
      separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is
      effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after
      September 15, 2006. The Company has evaluated the effect of SFAS No. 156 and
      determined that it does not expect a material impact from the adoption to its
      consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results from operations.

In
      July
      2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for
      Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income
      Taxes". FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should
      recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain
      tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
      Under
      FIN 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences
      of such positions presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the
      position and all relevant facts, but without considering time values. FIN 48
      also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive, annual,
      tabular roll-forward of the unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective
      for
      fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect
      the
      adoption of FIN 48 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial
      position, liquidity, or results of operations.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which
      addresses the measurement of fair value by companies when they are required
      to
      use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP.
      SFAS
      No. 157 provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP
      which is intended to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and
      comparable and improve disclosures about those measures. SFAS No. 157 will
      be
      effective for an entity's financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
      after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS
      No.
      157 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results
      of
      operations.


NOTES
        TO
        THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position No. AUG AIR-1 ("FSP No. AUG
      AIR-1") which addresses the accounting for planned major maintenance activities.
      FSP No. AUG AIR-1 amends certain provisions in the American Institute of
      Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Industry Audit Guide and APB Opinion
      No.
      28, "Interim Financial Reporting". Four alternative methods of accounting for
      planned major maintenance activities were permitted: direct expense, built-in
      overhaul, deferral, and accrual ("accrue-in-advance"). This FSP prohibits the
      use of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance
      activities because it results in the recognition of a liability in a period
      prior to the occurrence of the transaction or event obligating the entity.
      FSP
      No. AUG AIR-1 is effective for an entity's financial statements issued for
      fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not utilize
      the
      accrue-in-advance method of accounting and therefore expects this FSP to have
      no
      impact on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of
      operations.

In
      February, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for
      Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB
      Statement No. 115." SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many
      financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified
      election dates. Upon adoption, an entity shall report unrealized gains and
      losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings
      at
      each subsequent reporting date. Most of the provisions apply only to entities
      that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No. 115,
      "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," applies
      to
      all entities with available for sale and trading securities. SFAS No. 159 will
      be effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins
      after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect SFAS
      No.
      159 will have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results
      of
      operations.

DIVESTITURE

Certain
      Businesses and Product Lines and Related Assets in CASPI, PCI, and Performance
      Polymers Segments

On
      October 31, 2006, the Company sold its Batesville, Arkansas manufacturing
      facility and related assets and the specialty organic chemicals product lines
      in
      the PCI segment for net proceeds of approximately $74 million and an earn-out
      provision based on biodiesel sales over the next three years. The Company also
      retained approximately $9 million of accounts receivable related to these
      businesses and product lines. The final purchase price is subject to change
      based upon working capital adjustments. The Company will continue to produce
      certain products for the buyer under ongoing supply agreements and purchase
      certain products from the buyer under ongoing purchase agreements with terms
      up
      to five years. In addition, the Company indemnified the buyer against certain
      liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal matters, environmental matters,
      and other representations and warranties. As of December 31, 2006, the Company
      has recorded a $7 million loss related to this transaction. Changes in estimates
      will be reflected in future periods.

On
      November 30, 2006, the Company sold

its
      PE
      and

Epolene

polymer
      businesses and related assets located at the Longview, Texas site and the
      Company's ethylene pipeline

in the
      CASPI and Performance Polymers segments for net proceeds of approximately $235
      million. The Company also retained approximately $83 million of accounts
      receivable related to these businesses and product lines. The final purchase
      price is subject to change based upon working capital adjustments. The Company
      will continue to produce certain products for the buyer under ongoing supply
      agreements and purchase certain products from the buyer under ongoing purchase
      agreements with terms up to ninety-nine years. As part of these agreements,
      the
      Company also expects to begin a staged phase-out of older cracking units in
      2007, with timing dependent in part on market conditions, resulting in
      accelerated depreciation and environmental closure obligations. In addition,
      the
      Company indemnified the buyer against certain liabilities primarily related
      to
      taxes, legal matters, environmental matters, and other representations and
      warranties. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has recorded a gain of $75
      million related to this transaction. However, changes in estimates will be
      reflected in future periods.

SUBSEQUENT
                EVENTS

In
      first
      quarter 2007, the Company

entered
      into an agreement to sell the San Roque, Spain manufacturing
      facility

.
      The
      agreement impacts approximately $40 million of fixed assets and

could
      lead to non-cash impairment charges in the first quarter of 2007. In addition,
      this agreement could result in restructuring charges, which would result in
      future cash expenditures. The restructuring charges are not expected to exceed
      $10 million. Management expects the underlying costs of and charges related
      to
      this decision to be reported as asset impairment and restructuring charges
      during the first quarter of 2007.

Disclosure
      Controls and Procedures

Eastman
      Chemical Company ("Eastman" or "The Company") maintains a set of disclosure
      controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
      disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and
      reported, within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
      Commission rules and forms. An evaluation was carried out under the supervision
      and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief
      Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the
      effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that
      evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company's disclosure
      controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2006.

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management
      of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial
      reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s CEO and
      CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
      reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external
      purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles.

The
      Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
      procedures that:

Pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company;

Provide
      reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
      preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the
      directors of the Company; and

Provide
      reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
      acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
      material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Management
      has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
      as of December 31, 2006 based on the framework established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
      (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s
      internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
      2006.

Management’s
      assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
      LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
      which appears herein.

Changes
      in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There
      has
      been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
      occurred during the fourth quarter of 2006 that has materially affected, or
      is
      reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
      financial reporting.
