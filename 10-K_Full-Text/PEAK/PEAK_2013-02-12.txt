ITEM 1.    Business

Business Overview

HCP, an S&P 500 company, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. We are a
Maryland corporation organized in 1985 to qualify as a self-administered real estate investment trust ("REIT"). We are headquartered in Long Beach, California, with offices in Nashville,
Tennessee and San Francisco, California. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate, and provide financing to healthcare providers. Our portfolio is comprised of
investments in the following five healthcare segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and
(v) hospital. We make investments within our healthcare segments using the following five investment products: (i) properties under lease, (ii) debt investments,
(iii) developments and redevelopments, (iv) investment management and (v) investments in senior housing operations utilizing the structure permitted by the Housing and Economic
Recovery Act of 2008, which is commonly referred to as "RIDEA."

The
delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that
the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following:

•

Compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services;

•

Specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and

•

Ongoing consolidation of a fragmented healthcare real estate sector.

Our
website address is

www.hcpi.com

. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish them to, the United States
("U.S.") Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Healthcare Industry

Healthcare is the single largest industry in the U.S. based on Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). According to the National Health
Expenditures report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"): (i) national health expenditures are projected to grow 3.8% in 2013 and 7.4% in 2014; (ii) the average
compounded annual growth rate for national health expenditures, over the projection period of 2015 through 2021, is anticipated to be 6.2%; and (iii) the healthcare industry is projected to
represent 17.8% of U.S. GDP in 2013.

Senior
citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services. According to CMS, on a per capita basis, the 75-year and older segment of the population spends 76% more on
healthcare than the 65 to 74-year-old segment and over 200% more than the population average.

Business Strategy

Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth, which allows us to maintain or increase dividends per
share to our shareholders. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification and
(iii) conservative financing.

Opportunistic Investing

We make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value. We attempt to position
ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria.

Portfolio Diversification

We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment, geography, operator, tenant and investment
product. We monitor, but do not limit, our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, investment product, geographic location, the number of
properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant, or loans we may make to a single borrower. With investments in multiple segments and investment products, we can focus on opportunities
with the most attractive risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole. We may structure transactions as master leases, require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications, obtain credit
enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk.

Conservative Financing

We believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach. We strive to
maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt-to-equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit
facility, access to capital markets and secured
debt lenders, relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners, and our ability to divest of assets. Our debt obligations are primarily fixed rate with staggered
maturities, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations.

We
finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange
for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing through offerings of



equity
and debt securities, placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors.

We
specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in Item 7, "2012 Transaction Overview," included elsewhere in this report.

Competition

Investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment
companies, pension funds, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources
and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete
may also be impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations,
new legislation and population trends.

Income
from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels, including: the quality of care
provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price and range of services offered, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral
sources, location, the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas, and the financial condition of our tenants and operators. Private, federal and state payment programs as well as
the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators. For a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions
affecting our business, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

Healthcare Segments

Senior housing.

At December 31, 2012, we had interests in 441 senior housing facilities, 21 of which are in a RIDEA structure.
Excluding RIDEA
properties, all of our senior housing facilities are leased to single tenants under triple-net lease structures. Senior housing facilities include assisted living facilities ("ALFs"),
independent living facilities ("ILFs") and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"), which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs. Services
provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as
Medicaid and Medicare. Our senior housing property types are further described below:

•

Assisted Living Facilities.

ALFs are licensed care
facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living ("ADL"), such as bathing, eating and dressing, yet require
limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community
excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single
rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. Levels of
personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. At December 31, 2012, we had interests in 363 ALFs.

•

Independent Living Facilities.

ILFs are designed to meet
the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need assistance with ADL.
However, in some of our



facilities,
residents have the option to contract for these services. At December 31, 2012, we had interests in 64 ILFs.

•

Continuing Care Retirement Communities.

CCRCs provide
housing and health-related services under long-term contracts. This alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change,
thus allowing residents to "age in place." Some CCRCs require a substantial entry or buy-in fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some
health services. CCRCs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry. At December 31, 2012, we had interests in 14 CCRCs.

During
the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired 129 senior housing communities for $1.7 billion, from a joint venture between Emeritus Corporation and Blackstone Real Estate
Partners VI, an affiliate of Blackstone (the "Blackstone JV"). Located in 29 states, the portfolio encompasses 10,077 units representing a diversified care mix of 61% assisted living, 25% independent
living, 13% memory care and 1% skilled nursing. Emeritus continues to operate the communities pursuant to a new triple-net, master lease for the 129 properties guaranteed by Emeritus. For
a more detailed description of the acquisition see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our
senior housing segment accounted for approximately 33%, 30% and 30% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following table
provides information about our senior housing operator concentration for the year ended December 31, 2012:

ManorCare.

(2)

Percentage
of total revenues from Emeritus includes partial results for Blackstone JV acquisition. Assuming that full-year results were included
for this acquisition in our 2012 revenues, the percentage of segment revenues and total revenues would be 36% and 12%, respectively.

(3)

Certain
of our properties are leased to tenants who have entered into management contracts with Sunrise to operate the respective property on their behalf.
To determine our concentration of revenues generated from properties operated by Sunrise, we aggregate revenue from these tenants with revenue generated from the two properties that are leased
directly to Sunrise.

(4)

Brookdale
percentages do not include $143 million of senior housing revenues, related to 21 senior housing facilities that Brookdale operates on our
behalf under a RIDEA structure. Assuming that these revenues were attributable to Brookdale, the percentage of combined segment and total revenues associated Brookdale would be 36% and 12%
respectively.

Post-acute/skilled nursing.

At December 31, 2012, we had interests in 312 post-acute/skilled nursing facilities
("SNFs"). SNFs offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and
revenues from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous
therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain SNFs provide some of the foregoing services on
an out-patient basis. Post-acute/skilled nursing services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for either by private sources or through
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. All of our SNFs are leased to single tenants under triple-net lease structures.



Our
post-acute/skilled nursing segment accounted for approximately 29%, 29% and 13% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The following table provides information about our post-acute/skilled nursing operator/tenant concentration for the year ended December 31, 2012:

Life science.

At December 31, 2012, we had interests in 113 life science properties, including four facilities owned by our
Investment
Management Platform. These properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies, scientific research institutions, government
agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry. While these properties contain similar characteristics to commercial office buildings, they generally contain more advanced
electrical, mechanical, and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ("HVAC") systems. The facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops
and related amenities. In many instances, life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space, in addition to landlord improvements, to accommodate biology, chemistry or
medical device research initiatives. Life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings. The business park and campus settings allow us
the opportunity to provide flexible, contiguous/adjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants. Our properties are located in well-established geographical markets known
for scientific research, including San Francisco, San Diego and Salt Lake City. At December 31, 2012, 96% of our life science leases (based on leased square feet) were under
triple-net structures.

Our
life science segment accounted for approximately 15%, 17% and 22% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following table
provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended December 31, 2012:

Medical office.

At December 31, 2012, we had interests in 273 medical office buildings ("MOBs"), including 66 facilities owned by
our
Investment Management Platform. These facilities typically contain physicians' offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services
such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings, they require additional plumbing,
electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room, and special equipment such as x-ray machines. In addition, MOBs are often built
to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain "vaults" or other specialized construction. Our MOBs are typically multi-tenant properties leased to healthcare providers
(hospitals and physician practices), with approximately 77% of our MOBs, based on square feet, located on hospital campuses and 94% are affiliated with hospital systems. At December 31, 2012,
47% of our medical office leases (based on leased square feet) were under triple-net structures.



Our
medical office segment accounted for approximately 18%, 19% and 25% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During the year ended
December 31, 2012, HCA, Inc. ("HCA"), as our tenant, contributed 14% of our medical office segment revenues.

Our
Investment Management Platform represents the following unconsolidated joint ventures: (i) HCP Ventures III, LLC, and HCP Ventures IV, LLC, which
consists of MOB portfolios, and (ii) the HCP Life Science ventures. For a more detailed description of these unconsolidated joint ventures, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Hospital.

At December 31, 2012, we had interests in 21 hospitals, including four facilities owned by our Investment Management
Platform.
Services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance and Health Maintenance Organizations or "HMOs"), or
through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our hospital property types include acute care, long-term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals. Our hospitals are generally leased
to single tenants or operators under triple-net lease structures.

Our
hospital segment accounted for approximately 5%, 5% and 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following table provides
information about our hospital operator/tenant concentration for the year ended December 31, 2012:

Investment Products

Properties under lease.

We primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under long-term leases. Most of our rents and other earned
income from leases are received under triple-net leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses. However, some of our MOBs and life science facility rents
are structured under gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such gross or modified gross leases, we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and
maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance.

Our
ability to grow income from properties under lease depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental
rates and occupancy levels, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries and (iii) control non-recoverable operating expenses. Most of our leases include contractual annual base rent
escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases and/or are a function of an inflation index.

Debt investments.

Our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities, which directly
or indirectly
own properties, and are subordinate to more senior debt, including mortgages and more senior mezzanine loans. Borrowers of our interests in mortgage and construction loans are typically healthcare
providers and healthcare real estate generally secures these loans.

Developments and redevelopments.

We generally commit to development projects that are at least 50% pre-leased or when we believe that
market conditions will support speculative construction. We work closely with our local real estate service providers, including brokerage, property management, project management and construction
management companies to assist us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments. Our development and redevelopment investments are primarily in our life science and medical office
segments. Redevelopments are properties that require



significant
capital expenditures (generally more than 25% of acquisition cost or existing basis) to update, achieve stabilization or to change the primary use of the properties.

Investment management.

We co-invest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as
partnerships or limited liability companies. We target institutional investors with long-term investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate.
Predominantly, we retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20% to 30% and serve as the managing member. These ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset
management fees, and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture.

Operating properties ("RIDEA").

We may enter into contracts with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a
structure permitted
by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as "RIDEA"). Under the provisions of RIDEA, a REIT may lease "qualified healthcare properties" on an arm's length basis to a
taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor." We view RIDEA as a structure primarily to be
used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points and to drive growth by: (i) transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale, operating efficiencies, and/or
ancillary services; or (ii) investing capital to reposition the asset.

Portfolio Summary

At December 31, 2012, we managed $21.3 billion of investments in our Owned Portfolio and Investment Management Platform.
At December 31, 2012, we also owned $540 million of assets under development, including redevelopment, and land held for future development.

Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement

Overview

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations
relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare
industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. These
regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to
comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several
government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our
tenants and



operators
can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators, excluding our medical office segment, at December 31, 2012 we estimate that approximately 18% and 14% of the
annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, respectively.

The
following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers' relationships and
arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from
filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and
fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations
of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the "Stark Law"), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to
entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing
presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and
administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal
or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state
false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring

qui tam

or "whistleblower" actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these
laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws.

Reimbursement

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among other sources, governmental healthcare programs, such as the
federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance carriers and HMOs. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform
initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth
in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators.

Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need

Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and
inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states
require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities. The



approval
process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants' and operators' abilities to expand or change their businesses.

Life Science Facilities

While certain of our life science tenants include some well-established companies, other such tenants are less established
and, in some cases, may not yet have a product approved by the Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale. Creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device
requires substantial investments of time and money, in part, because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry; it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the
product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance.

Senior Housing Entrance Fee Communities

Certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance
fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form of long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities are
subject to significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility's financial condition, establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial
restrictions, the right of
residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters.

Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA")

Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are "public
accommodations" as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily
achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by
persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant.
Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an
ongoing one, and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.

Environmental Matters

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare
facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender.
Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender,
such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating
to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property
damages and the owner's or secured lender's liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such
substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral
which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. For a description of the risks associated with environmental matters, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.



ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

The section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

As
set forth below, we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories:

•

Risks related to our business; and

•

Risks related to tax matters, including REIT-related risks.

Risks Related to Our Business

Volatility or disruption in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and
development activities.

The global financial markets recently have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions. While these conditions have stabilized
since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets generally have shown signs of improvement, the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption
and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development
activities.

Market
volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures, that may result in a substantial decrease in the value
of our properties and those of our joint ventures. As a result, we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill, if any, which may require us to
recognize impairment charges in earnings.

We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to
meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business.

We may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations. If we are unable to obtain enough internal
capital, we may need to rely on external sources of capital (including debt and equity financing) to fulfill our capital requirements. If we cannot access these external sources of capital, we may not
be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital
depends upon a number of factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including but not limited to:

•

general availability of credit and market conditions, including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost;

•

the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities;

•

the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions;

•

our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility;

•

the financial integrity of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their
willingness to make additional loans to us, and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms, or at all;

•

the stability in the market value of our properties;



•

the financial performance and general market perception of our operators, tenants and borrowers;

•

changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the United States of
its obligations; and

•

issues facing the healthcare industry, including, but not limited to, healthcare reform and changes in government
reimbursement policies.

If
our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations, refinance our debt obligations, fund
dividend payments, acquire properties and development activities.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and negatively impact the market
price of our securities, including our common stock.

The credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall
financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the
terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate, we would
likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings
would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.

Our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations.

Our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2012 was approximately $8.7 billion. We may incur additional indebtedness
in the future, including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets, which may be substantial. Any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of
our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available
to us to pay dividends, conduct development activities, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Increased indebtedness can also limit our
ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more
vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels. Increased future debt service
obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed.

Covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future,
require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage and leverage ratio, tangible net worth
requirements and maintaining REIT status. Our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants, which
limit our operational flexibility. For example, mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability, without the consent of the lender, to further
encumber or sell the applicable properties, or to replace the applicable tenant or operator. Breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties



and
cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness, even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee. Additionally, defaults under the leases or operating agreements
related to mortgaged properties, including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator, may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and cross-defaults under
certain of our other indebtedness. Covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

An increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt, and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets and limit
our acquisition, investment and development activities.

If interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt. This increased cost could make the financing of any
acquisition and development activity more costly. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing
and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our
assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 48% of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial
arrangements with the following four companies: HCR ManorCare (30%); Emeritus (8%); Sunrise (5%); and Brookdale (5%). The failure, inability or unwillingness of these operators or tenants to meet
their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations, which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay, cause our stock price to decline and have
other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In
addition, any failure by these operators or tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation
and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These
operators and tenants generally have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective
businesses, and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations.

Economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 44% of our revenue was derived from properties located in California (22%),
Texas (12%) and Florida (10%). As a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real
estate conditions, increased competition or decreased demand, and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

We lease our properties directly to operators in most cases, and in certain other cases, we lease to third-party tenants who enter into
long-term management agreements with operators to manage the



properties.
Although our leases, financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict an
operator or tenant, or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that
may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies. For example, we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy
filing. A debtor has the right to assume, or to assume and assign to a third party, or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding. If a debtor were to reject its leases with us, our
claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed
under the lease. In addition, the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in
our debt securities, credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators. In addition, under certain conditions, defaults under the underlying
mortgages may result in cross-default under our other indebtedness. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances, the
bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse
consequences. In addition, many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide long-term custodial care to the elderly; evicting such operators for failure to pay rent
while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful.

Our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses.

Our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that
covers us, as well as the tenants and operators. Some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur,
we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the
property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We continually review the insurance maintained by our
tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in
excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future.

Our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs.

In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought
litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities. Also, in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect
of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition, their
cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues. Cost increases could cause our operators to
be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance, potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and
litigation costs. In addition, as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants, for
which claims such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against, but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part.



Operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, may cease to operate or
be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

Certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal, state and local laws and regulations that are
subject to frequent and substantial changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing
law. See "Item 1—Business—Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement" above. For example, to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant
portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to:

•

statutory and regulatory changes;

•

retroactive rate adjustments;

•

recovery of program overpayments or set-offs;

•

administrative rulings;

•

policy interpretations;

•

payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers;

•

government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities); and

•

interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property.

In
recent years, governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures. Healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of
significant importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators' and
tenants' costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. The failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws, requirements
and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us.

Legislation to address the federal government's projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results
of operations.

Congress may consider legislation to address the fiscal condition of the United States that may include entitlement reform, tax reform,
reductions in domestic discretionary spending, budget sequestration of certain non-defense discretionary federal programs, and an increase in the national debt limit that could have a
material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, Congress may consider legislation affecting the funding of entitlement programs such
as Medicare, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage Plans that may result in reductions in funding and reimbursements to providers; tax reform that may impact corporate and individual tax rates and
retirement plans; and an increase in the federal debt limit that may have an impact on credit markets. Additionally, the Administration may implement proposals under current law or legislation that
may be approved by Congress that could modify the delivery of services and benefits under Medicare, Medicaid or Medicare Advantage Plans. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our
operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us.



Operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to
meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

Certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and
inspection laws, regulations and standards. Our operators' or tenants' failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of
reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. For example, certain of our properties may
require a license, registration and/or certificate of need to operate. Failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license, registration or certificate of need, or loss of a required license,
registration or certificate of need, would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant. Additionally, failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply
with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us, and therefore may materially adversely impact us. See
"Item 1—Business—Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement—Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need" above.

Increased competition, as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast, have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our operators
and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

The healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future. The occupancy levels at, and rental income
from, our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital
resources. These entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels, including the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price,
the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics
of the population in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the
properties and their tenants. Our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at
home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. Such competition, which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest, has caused the
occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease. We cannot be
certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Further, many competing
companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants. Thus, our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit
their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us,
potentially decreasing our revenues, impairing our assets, and increasing our collection and dispute costs.

Our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty.

Life science tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique
risks, as follows:

•

some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research, development and clinical testing of their
products and technologies. If private investors, the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities, a tenant's business may be adversely affected or fail;



•

the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal,
state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain;

•

even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, the product may still present
significant regulatory and liability risks, including, among others, the possible later discovery of safety concerns, competition from new products, and ultimately the expiration of patent protection
for the product;

•

our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of
government or private healthcare payors; and

•

our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws.

We
cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses. If our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to
us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be
unable to successfully operate, occupy or reposition the underlying real estate, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.

If an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our
interest by acquiring title to the
collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property's investment potential. In some cases, as noted above, the collateral consists of the equity
interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and, accordingly, we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity.
Operators, tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for
lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. Foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the facility may
prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure, and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses. Even if we are able to successfully
foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators, if at all, which would adversely
affect our ability to fully recover our investment.

Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities.

Transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications,
including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of
commercial operations and other types of real estate. The replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal, state or local government agency
necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. If we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms,
or at all, we may take possession of a facility, which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and
licenses, all of which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.



Competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase, or develop, suitable healthcare facilities, to grow our investment portfolio.

We face significant competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds,
healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more
challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners
seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. If we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline, identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare
facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely
affected.

We may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants.

Healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. The
improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, are costly and at times tenant-specific. A new or replacement
operator or tenant may require different features in a property, depending on that operator's or tenant's particular operations. If a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a
property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant. Also, if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple
operators or tenants, we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to re-lease the space. These expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.



We face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and, under certain circumstances, prevent
completion of development activities once undertaken.

Large-scale, ground-up development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us, including risks
that:

•

a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or
failure to recover expenses already incurred;

•

the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and
higher materials, transportation, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make the completion of the development project less profitable;

•

construction and/or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;

•

the project may not be completed on schedule, which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service
expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, labor conditions, material shortages, regulatory hurdles, civil unrest and acts of war; and

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the
property profitable.

These
risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.

We have and may continue in the future to develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when
circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership,
including:

•

we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could
require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes, including litigation or arbitration;

•

our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including
the timing, terms and strategies for any investments;

•

our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted;

•

our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to
fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and

•

our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.

From time to time, we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations, our business, results of operations and financial condition
may be materially adversely affected.

Acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. Successful integration of the operations
of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may encounter difficulties in
these integrations. Potential difficulties associated with



acquisitions
include the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies and the
assumption of unexpected liabilities, including:

•

liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;

•

unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller;

•

liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior
to our acquisition;

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the seller; and

•

liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.

In
addition, the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected, including in respect of estimated cost savings. Inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental
or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues. Similarly, we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards
established for their intended use. If we have difficulties with any of these areas, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies,
we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions, and this may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions, which may involve the expenditure of significant funds.

We regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize shareholder value and believe that currently there are available a
number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business, given the recent industry consolidation trend. In connection with our review of such transactions, we regularly engage
in discussions with potential
acquisition candidates, some of which are material. Any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities, the incurrence of debt, assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of
significant expenditures, any of which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the financing required for such acquisitions may not
be available on commercially favorable terms or at all.

Loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us.

We are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers, and competition for these individuals is intense. Although our chief
executive officer, chief financial officer, chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us, we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us. The loss or
limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

Unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits
allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various
claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our



business,
results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, litigation. In addition, litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to
increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations.

We may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future
revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense.

We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are
adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we continually review the insurance maintained by us. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas
exposed to earthquake, windstorm, flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses. In particular, our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to
earthquake activity. While we purchase insurance for earthquake, windstorm, flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by
outside consultants, there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses. These losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a
portion of the capital we have invested in a property. The insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially
reasonable basis in the future. In addition, there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable
insurance market.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments.

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or previous owner of real estate, we may be
required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage
and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the
government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Although we (i) currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to
deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable, and (ii) generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, such
liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance, the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property. The presence of contamination or the
failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. As the owner of a site, we may also be
held liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. Although we are generally indemnified by the current
operators or tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. We may also experience environmental liabilities arising
from conditions not known to us.

The impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted.

Legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes
in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level.



Notably,
in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, along with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the
"Affordable Care Act"). The passage of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in comprehensive reform legislation that is expected to expand healthcare coverage to millions of currently uninsured people
beginning in 2014 and provide for significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system over the next ten years. To help fund this expansion, the Affordable Care Act outlines certain reductions in
Medicare reimbursements for various healthcare providers, including long-term acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, as well as certain other changes to Medicare payment
methodologies. This comprehensive healthcare legislation provides for extensive future rulemaking by regulatory authorities, and also may be altered or amended. We cannot accurately predict whether
any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and, thus, our business. Similarly, while we can
anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal healthcare
programs, we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our business.

The
Supreme Court's decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state Medicaid programs with a
federally mandated expansion of those programs has not reduced the uncertain impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade. We can expect that the federal
authorities will continue to implement the law, but, because of the Court's mixed ruling, the implementation will take longer than originally expected, with a commensurate increase in the period of
uncertainty regarding the law's full long term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare.

Risk Related to Tax, including REIT-Related risks

Loss of our tax status as a REIT would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely
within our control. We intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a REIT. However, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet, through actual
annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Code. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at
least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,
excluding net capital gains. In addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding
qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we have
operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

If
we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we
issue and to make distributions to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we will be subject to corporate-level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income
at regular corporate rates;



•

we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for
the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a REIT.

As
a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value
of our common stock.

We could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit, delay or impede future sales of our properties.

If, during the ten-year period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies, we recognize gain on the disposition of
any property acquired, then, to the extent of the excess of (i) the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over (ii) our adjusted income tax basis in such property
as of that date, we will be required to pay a corporate-level federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate. There can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will
not occur, and these requirements could limit, delay or impede future sales of our properties.

In
addition, the IRS may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies, in which case we will owe these
taxes plus interest and penalties, if any.

There are uncertainties relating to the calculation of non-REIT tax earnings and profits ("E&P") in certain acquisitions, which may require us to distribute E&P.

In order to remain qualified as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated non-REIT
E&P of certain companies that we acquire, prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. Failure to make such E&P distributions would result in our disqualification as a
REIT. The determination of the amount to be distributed in such E&P distributions is a complex factual and legal determination. We may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our
analysis, or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the IRS. We currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such E&P distributions. There are, however,
substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of E&P, including the possibility that the IRS could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased,
which would increase our non-REIT E&P. Moreover, an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition
could result in an increase in accumulated non-REIT E&P, which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our then-existing stockholders, if we qualify under
rules for curing this type of default, or could result in our disqualification as a REIT.

Thus,
we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our non-REIT E&P by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. Moreover,
although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our E&P, we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on
us of doing so.

Our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock.

Our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us
in preserving our qualification as a REIT. Under our charter, subject to certain exceptions, no person or entity may own, actually or constructively, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock.



Additionally,
our charter has a 9.9% ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares, which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock. Our
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit. The ownership limits may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that
might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

We are subject to certain provisions of Maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations.

The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations,
including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an "interested stockholder"
or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria
are met. An interested stockholder is
generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a Maryland corporation. Unless our Board of Directors takes action
to exempt us, generally or with respect to certain transactions, from this statute in the future, the Maryland Business Combination Act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other
persons.

In
addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the Maryland Business Combination Act, our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations. Our charter
requires that, except in certain circumstances, "business combinations," including a merger or consolidation, and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities, with a "related person,"
including a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock, be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding voting stock.

The
restrictions on business combinations provided under Maryland law and contained in our charter may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such
transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests.

ITEM 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 2.    Properties

We are organized to invest in income-producing healthcare-related facilities. In evaluating potential investments, we consider a
multitude of factors, including:

•

Location, construction quality, age, condition and design of the property;

•

Geographic area, proximity to other healthcare facilities, type of property and demographic profile;

•

Whether the expected risk-adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital;

•

Whether the rent or operating income provides a competitive market return to our investors;

•

Duration, rental rates, operator and tenant quality and other attributes of in-place leases, including master
lease structures;

•

Current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet our operational needs;

•

Availability of security such as letters of credit, security deposits and guarantees;

•

Potential for capital appreciation;



•

Expertise and reputation of the operator or tenant;

•

Occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities;

•

The mix of revenues generated at healthcare facilities between privately-paid and government reimbursed;

•

Availability of qualified operators or property managers and whether we can manage the property;

•

Potential alternative uses of the facilities;

•

The regulatory and reimbursement environment in which the properties operate;

•

Tax laws related to REITs;

•

Prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing; and

•

Our access to and cost of capital.

The
following summarizes our property and direct financing lease ("DFL") investments as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 (square feet and dollars in thousands).

Senior
housing includes average units of 5,008 and 1,672 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, that are in a RIDEA structure
in which resident occupancy impacts our annual revenue. The average resident occupancy for these units was 86% and 88% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. All other
senior housing, post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital facilities are generally leased to single tenants under triple-net lease structures for each of the periods reported,
for which these facilities were or approximately 100% leased.

(2)

Average
annual rent per unit/square feet is presented as a ratio of revenues comprised of rental and related revenues, tenant recoveries and income from
direct financing leases divided by the average capacity or average occupied square feet of the facilities and annualized for mergers and acquisitions for the year in which they occurred. Average
annual rent for leased properties (including DFLs) exclude termination fees and non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of above and below
market lease intangibles and DFL interest accretion). Average annual rent for operating properties operated under a RIDEA structure is calculated based on NOI divided by the average capacity of the
facilities.

(3)

Capacity
for senior housing facilities is measured in units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom units). Capacity for post-acute/skilled
nursing and hospitals is measured in licensed bed count. Capacity for life science facilities and MOBs is measured in square feet. Average capacity for senior housing, post-acute/skilled
nursing and hospitals is as reported by the respective tenants or operators for the twelve month period and one quarter in arrears from the periods presented.

to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments to us and our ability to recover investments made, if applicable, in their operations;

(f)

The
financial weakness of some operators and tenants, including potential bankruptcies and downturns in their businesses, which results in uncertainties
regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators' and/or tenants' leases;

(g)

Changes
in federal, state or local laws and regulations, including those affecting the healthcare industry that affect our costs of compliance or increase
the costs, or otherwise affect the operations of our operators, tenants and borrowers;

(h)

The
potential impact of future litigation matters, including the possibility of larger than expected litigation costs, adverse results and related
developments;

(i)

Competition
for tenants and borrowers, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases;

(j)

Our
ability to negotiate the same or better terms with new tenants or operators if existing leases are not renewed or we exercise our right to replace an
existing operator or tenant upon default;



(k)

Availability
of suitable properties to acquire at favorable prices and the competition for the acquisition and financing of those properties;

(l)

The
financial, legal, regulatory and reputational difficulties of significant operators of our properties;

(m)

The
risk that we may not be able to achieve the benefits of investments within expected time-frames or at all, or within expected cost
projections;

(n)

The
ability to obtain financing necessary to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms;

(o)

The
risks associated with our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities, including our lack of sole decision making authority and our
reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition and continued cooperation; and

(p)

Changes
in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the United States of its obligations.

Except
as required by law, we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or
otherwise.

The
information set forth in this Item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.

Executive Summary

We are a self-administered REIT that, together with our unconsolidated joint ventures, invests primarily in real estate
serving the healthcare industry in the U.S. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers. At December 31, 2012, our
portfolio of investments, including properties owned by our Investment Management Platform, consisted of interests in 1,160 facilities.

Our
business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) conservative financing. We actively
redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential or shorter investment horizons into assets representing longer term investments with attractive risk adjusted return potential. We make
investments where the expected risk-adjusted



return
exceeds our cost of capital and strive to capitalize on our operator, tenant and other business relationships to grow our business.

Our
strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our
management team's experience and our infrastructure. We follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of
properties that no longer fit our strategy.

We
primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under long-term leases with fixed and/or inflation indexed escalators. Most of our rents and other earned
income from leases are received under triple-net leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses; however, some of our medical office and life science leases
are structured as gross or modified gross leases. Operating expenses are generally related to MOB and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed on our behalf ("RIDEA
properties"). Accordingly, for such MOBs, life science facilities and RIDEA properties, we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property
management fees, utilities, employee costs for resident care and insurance. Our growth for these assets depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income
from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels; (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures; and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our
operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. At December 31, 2012, the contractual maturities in our portfolio of leased assets were 13%
through 2015 (measured in dollars of expiring base rents).

Access
to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of
additional securities or secured debt. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy.

2012 Transaction Overview

Investment Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we completed $2.6 billion of investments as follows:

$1.7 Billion Senior Housing Portfolio Acquisition and $52 Million Secured Financing

During the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired 129 senior housing communities for $1.7 billion, from a joint venture between
Emeritus and the Blackstone JV. Located in 29 states, the portfolio encompasses 10,077 units representing a diversified care mix of 61% assisted living, 25% independent living, 13% memory care and 1%
skilled nursing. Based on current operating performance, the 129 communities consist of 95 that are stabilized and 34 that are currently in lease—up. The transaction closed in two stages:
(i) 127 senior housing facilities on October 31, 2012 for $1.68 billion representing 9,842 units; and (ii) two senior housing facilities on December 4, 2012 for
$24 million representing 235 units.

Emeritus
continues to operate the communities pursuant to a new triple-net, master lease for the 129 properties (the "Master Lease") guaranteed by Emeritus. The Master Lease
provides aggregate contractual rent in the first year of $103.6 million. The contractual rent will increase annually by the greater of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index
("CPI") or 3.7% on average over the initial five years, and thereafter by the greater of CPI or 3.0% for the remaining initial lease term. At the beginning of the sixth lease year, rent on the 34
lease-up properties will increase to the greater of the percentage increase in CPI or fair market, subject to a floor of 103% and a cap of 130% of the prior year's rent.



The
leased properties are grouped into three pools that share comparable characteristics and these leased pools have initial terms of 14 to 16 years. Emeritus has two extension
options, which, if exercised, will provide for lease terms of 30 to 35 years. We are still evaluating the acquisition of up to four additional communities related to this transaction.

Concurrent
with the acquisition, Emeritus purchased nine communities from the Blackstone JV, for which we have provided secured debt financing of $52 million with a
four-year term. The loan is secured by the underlying real estate and is prepayable at Emeritus' option. The interest rate on the loan mirrors the 6.1% lease yield, including the annual
increases through maturity.

$853 Million of Additional Investment Transactions

On August 7, 2012, we completed the acquisition of eight on-campus MOBs for $80 million from Scottsdale
Healthcare. Located in Scottsdale, Arizona, the portfolio represents 398,000 square feet with an occupancy of 89% at closing.

Between
July and October 2012, we acquired 12 MOBs from The Boyer Company valued at $188 million, including DownREIT units and debt valued at $43 million and
$60 million, respectively; the MOBs are primarily located on the campuses of HCA, Iasis Healthcare and Community Health Systems and comprise 758,000 square feet with an occupancy of 88% at
closing. The transaction closed in three stages: (i) six MOBs on July 31, 2012 for $77 million representing 327,000 square feet; (ii) four MOBs on August 15, 2012
for $49 million representing 199,000 square feet and; (iii) two MOBs on October 19, 2012 for $62 million representing 232,000 square feet.

On
July 31, 2012, we closed a mezzanine loan facility to lend up to $205 million to Tandem Health Care ("Tandem"), an affiliate of Formation Capital, as part of the
recapitalization of a post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio. We funded $100 million (the "First Tranche") at closing and have a commitment to fund an additional $105 million
(the "Second Tranche") between February 2013 and August 2013. The Second Tranche will be used to repay debt senior to our loan. At closing, the loan was subordinate to
$400 million in senior mortgage debt and $137 million in senior mezzanine debt. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 12% and 14% per annum for the First and Second Tranches,
respectively. Including fees received at closing, the loan has a blended yield to maturity of approximately 13% assuming both tranches are funded. The facility has a total term of up to 63 months from
the initial closing and is prepayable at the borrower's option.

On
June 28, 2012, we made an investment in senior unsecured notes with an aggregate par value of £138.5 million at a discount for
£136.8 million, as part of the financing for Terra Firma's £825 million acquisition of Four Seasons Health Care ("Four Seasons"), the largest elderly and
specialist care provider in the United Kingdom with 445 care homes and 61
specialist care centers. The notes mature in June 2020 and are non-callable until June 2016. The notes bear interest on their par value at a fixed rate of 12.25% per annum,
with an original discount resulting in a yield to maturity of 12.5%. Terra Firma, a leading European private equity firm, provided £345 million in equity financing, resulting in a
loan-to-capitalization of 62% for the Four Seasons notes. The £136.8 million for this investment is match funded by an equivalent GBP denominated unsecured
term loan discussed below.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, we made other investments of $270 million as follows: (i) acquisition of a MOB for $13 million;
(ii) acquisition of a life science facility for $8 million; (iii) acquisition of a senior housing facility for $4 million; (iv) acquisition of a parcel of land
adjacent to one of our hospitals for $3 million; and (v) funding of development and other capital projects of $242 million, primarily in our life science, senior housing and
medical office segments.



Other Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold two senior housing facilities for $111 million, a parcel of land in our
life science segment for $18 million, a skilled nursing facility for $15 million and a MOB for $7 million.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, we expanded our tenant relationship with General Atomics in Poway, CA to a total of 396,000 square feet, consisting of the following:
(i) a lease extension of 281,000 square feet through June 2024, and (ii) a new 10-year lease (expected to commence mid-2014) for a 115,000 square feet
build-to-suit development. As part of this transaction, General Atomics purchased a 19-acre land parcel from us for $18 million; in connection with the
agreement to sell the land parcel, we incurred a $7.9 million impairment charge.

Financings

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we raised $3.5 billion of capital in the equity and credit markets as follows:

In
connection with funding the $1.7 billion Senior Housing Portfolio acquisition, we completed the following capital market
transactions:

•

On November 19, 2012, we issued $800 million of 2.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2020. The notes were
priced at 99.729% of the principal amount with an effective yield to maturity of 2.667%. Net proceeds from this offering were $793 million.

•

On October 19, 2012, we completed a public offering of 22 million shares of common stock and received net
proceeds of $979 million.

On
July 30, 2012, in connection with our Four Seasons senior unsecured notes investment, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a
£137 million four-year unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") that accrues interest at a rate of GBP London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.20%, based on our
current debt ratings. Concurrent with the closing of the Term Loan, we entered into a four-year interest rate swap agreement that fixes the rate of the Term Loan at 1.81%, subject to
adjustments based on our credit ratings. The Term Loan contains a one-year committed extension option and similar covenants to those in our unsecured revolving line of credit facility.

On
July 23, 2012, we issued $300 million of 3.15% senior unsecured notes due in 2022. The notes were priced at 98.888% of the principal amount with an effective yield to
maturity of 3.28%. Net proceeds from this offering were $294 million.

In
June 2012, we completed a $376 million offering of 8.97 million shares of common stock at $41.88 per share with the proceeds used primarily to repay
$250 million of 6.45% senior unsecured notes at maturity on June 25, 2012.

On
March 27, 2012, we completed an amendment to our existing $1.5 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility. We improved the pricing and extended the maturity of
the facility one additional year to March 2016. Based on our current credit ratings, the amended facility bears interest annually at one-month LIBOR plus 1.075% and has a facility
fee of 0.175%, which in the aggregate represents a 55 basis point reduction to our funded interest cost.

On
March 22, 2012, we announced the redemption of the 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E and 7.82 million shares of 7.10% Series F preferred stock at
a price of $25.00 per share, or $295.5 million in aggregate, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to April 23, 2012 (the redemption date). As a result of the redemption, we incurred a
charge of $10.4 million related to the original issuance costs of the



preferred
stock (this charge is presented as an additional preferred stock dividend in our consolidated statements of income).

On
March 22, 2012, we priced a $359 million offering of 9.0 million shares of common stock at $39.93 per share with the proceeds used primarily to redeem all
outstanding shares of our preferred stock.

On
January 23, 2012, we issued $450 million of 3.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2019; net proceeds from the offering were $444 million.

Dividends

Quarterly dividends paid during 2012 aggregated $2.00 per share, which represents a 4.2% increase from 2011. On January 25,
2013, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.525 per share, which represents a 5% increase. The common stock dividend will be paid on
February 19, 2013 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 4, 2013. Based on the first quarter's dividend, the annualized rate of distribution for 2013 is $2.10,
compared with $2.00 in 2012.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires our
management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience
and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances
relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated
financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made
in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require
estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that
we control, through voting rights or other means. We consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("VIEs") when we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE at: (i) the inception of the
variable interest entity, (ii) as a result of a change in circumstance identified during our continuous review of our VIE relationships or (iii) upon the occurrence of a qualifying
reconsideration event.

We
make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors
includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the
entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the
entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE



affects
the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity, our
assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.

If
we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the VIE (either tenant or borrower) rather than
the results of the variable interest in the VIE. We would depend on the VIE to provide us timely financial information and rely on the internal control of the VIE to provide accurate financial
information. If the VIE has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely impact the quality and/or timing
of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the
tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken
possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the
tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant
improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction
of revenue over the lease term. The determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment. If our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting
purposes were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.

Certain
leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized
when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. The recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts
owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. Our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the
inability of tenants to make
contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic
conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. We
exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

Loans
receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. We
recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the interest method applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectibility of the
future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums, discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans.

We
use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference
between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the



properties
is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably
assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized unearned income. The determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment. If our assessments
for accounting purposes were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.

Loans
and DFLs are placed on non-accrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on
non-accrual status, loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, in which all
cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or DFL, based on management's judgment of collectibility.

Allowances
are established for loans and DFLs based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is deemed
probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and
requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is
based upon our assessment of the borrower's or lessee's overall financial condition, resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if
appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan's or DFL's effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors. While
our assumptions are based in part upon historical data, our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Real Estate

We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based
upon the relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant,
land and in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect
the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the value of in-place leases, we
make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected
lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the
acquired in-place leases.

A
variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project
that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development
include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest
costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease
capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements.



Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

We assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or
asset group to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider market conditions, as well as our intent with respect
to holding or disposing of the asset. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where
considered necessary. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at least annually. If it is determined, based on certain qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount, we apply the two-step approach. Certain qualitative factors assessed by us include current macroeconomic conditions, state of the equity and capital markets
and the overall financial and operating performance of HCP. If we qualitatively determine that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the
two-step approach is necessary.

If
the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value, then the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill
impairment. The second step requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to
determine the amount of impairment. We estimate the current fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques, including applying capitalization rates
to segment net operating income, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, as necessary. The fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that
we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company.

The
determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate
assets and reporting units, and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our ability to accurately predict future
operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions
may have a material impact on our financial results.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee's earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of
operations.

The
initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to
the sale of interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value. If
we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded.
The determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is "other-than-temporary" of investments in unconsolidated joint



ventures
involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general
economic conditions and trends, severity and duration of the fair value deficiency, and other relevant factors. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models
are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these
assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our
compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax
expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal, state and local tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) the potential for
built-in-gain recognized related to prior-tax-free acquisitions of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any
given period are included within the income tax provision.

Results of Operations

We evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments: (i) senior housing,
(ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital. Under the senior housing, life science,
post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital segments, we invest or co-invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties, through the acquisition and development of real
estate, management of operations and by debt issued by operators in these sectors. Under the medical office segment, we invest or co-invest through the acquisition and development of MOBs
that are leased under gross, modified gross or triple-net leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The accounting policies
of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

We
use net operating income ("NOI") and adjusted NOI to assess and compare property level performance, including our same property portfolio ("SPP"), and to make decisions about resource
allocations. We believe these measures provide investors relevant and useful information because they reflect only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and
present them on an unleveraged basis. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net
income as defined by GAAP since NOI excludes certain components from net income. Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment information and the relevant reconciliations from net income to NOI and adjusted NOI.

Operating
expenses are generally related to MOB and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed on our behalf (RIDEA properties). We generally recover all or a
portion of MOB and life science expenses from the tenants (tenant recoveries). The presentation of expenses as operating or general and administrative is based on the underlying nature of the expense.
Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses.

Our
evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of our SPP and our total property portfolio. SPP information allows us to evaluate the performance
of our leased property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties. We identify our SPP as stabilized properties that remained in
operations and



were
consistently reported as leased properties or RIDEA properties for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented. Accordingly, it takes a stabilized
property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our SPP. Newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of
lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) controls the physical use of at least 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. Newly completed developments, including
redevelopments, are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. SPP NOI excludes certain non-property
specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2012 to the Year Ended December 31, 2011

During the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired 129 senior housing communities from the Blackstone JV (see additional information in
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The transaction closed in two stages: (i) 127 senior housing facilities on October 31, 2012; and (ii) two senior housing
facilities on December 4, 2012. The results of operations from the acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates.

On
April 7, 2011, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of HCR ManorCare's real estate assets; additionally, we purchased a noncontrolling equity interest in the
operations of HCR ManorCare. On January 14, 2011, we acquired our partner's 65% interest in HCP Ventures II that resulted in the consolidation of HCP Ventures II. On
September 1, 2011, we entered into management contracts with Brookdale with respect to 21 senior living communities (these 21 communities were acquired in January 2011 as part of our
purchase of HCP Ventures II). These 21 communities are now in a RIDEA structure are managed by Brookdale, the respective resident level revenues and related operating expenses are reported in
our consolidated financial statements. See additional information regarding the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, HCP Ventures II purchase and the Brookdale RIDEA transaction in Notes 3, 8 and
12, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations from our HCR ManorCare, HCP Ventures II and 21 properties managed under a RIDEA structure are reflected in
our financial statements from those respective dates.

Segment NOI and Adjusted NOI

The tables below provide selected operating information for our SPP and total property portfolio for each of our five business
segments. Our consolidated SPP consists of 565 properties representing properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized on or prior to January 1, 2011 and that remained in operations
under a consistent reporting structure through December 31, 2012. Our consolidated total property portfolio represents 1,086 and 932 properties at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, and excludes properties classified as discontinued operations.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

Including the impact of our SPP, our total portfolio NOI and adjusted NOI for the year ended
December 31, 2012 primarily increased as a result of 66 senior housing leased properties classified as DFLs that were acquired on April 7, 2011 from HCR ManorCare and 127 senior housing
communities acquired on October 31, 2012 and two senior housing communities acquired on December 4, 2012 from the Blackstone JV (see Notes 3, 4 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, the Blackstone JV acquisition and Net Investments in DFLs, respectively).

Additionally,
HCP Ventures II was consolidated on January 14, 2011 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), resulting in us
recognizing rental and related revenues for the 25 leased properties commencing on that date. On September 1, 2011, for 21 of these 25 properties, we entered into management contracts in a
structure permitted by RIDEA (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), resulting in the termination of the properties' leases. For these 21 properties
that are now in a RIDEA structure, the resident-level revenues and related operating expenses are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning on that date.

SPP and Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

NOI increased primarily as a result of lease expansions and extensions and a decline in
non-reimbursable operating expenses, partially offset by a decline in lease termination fees. Adjusted NOI increased primarily as a result of a $4 million rent payment in connection
with a February 2012 amendment to a lease, annual rent escalations, lease expansions and extensions, and a decline in non-reimbursable operating expenses.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, 978,000 square feet of new and renewal leases commenced at an average annual base rent of $21.71 per square foot compared to 776,000
square feet of expiring and terminated leases with an average annual base rent of $24.23 per square foot. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we acquired 77,000 square feet with an average
annual base rent of $9.79 per square foot.

From
our past presentation of SPP for the year ended December 31, 2011, we removed (i) a MOB that was sold or classified as held for sale; and
(ii) three MOBs that were placed into redevelopment in 2012, which no longer meet our criteria for SPP as of the date they were placed into redevelopment.

SPP NOI and Adjusted NOI.

SPP NOI and adjusted NOI increased year-over-year primarily as a result of rent escalations and an
increase in medical office occupancy.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

Including the impact of our SPP, our total portfolio NOI and adjusted NOI increased primarily as
a result of
the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions during 2012.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, 2.2 million square feet of new and renewal leases commenced at an average annual base rent of $21.94 per square foot compared to
2.1 million square feet of expiring and terminated leases with an average annual base rent of $22.43 per square foot. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we acquired
1.1 million square feet with an average annual base rent of $22.19 per square foot.

SPP and Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

NOI and adjusted NOI increased for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a
result of
rent escalations and the new leases that commenced in 2012 for two of our hospitals.

Other Income and Expense Items

Interest income.

Interest income decreased $75 million to $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease
was
primarily the result of the following: (i) a decrease of $54 million in income earned from and due to the settlement of our HCR ManorCare debt investments in 2011 and (ii) a
decrease of $43 million in income earned from and as a result of prepayment premiums and unamortized discounts recognized in April 2011 upon the early repayment of our loans to Genesis
HealthCare. The decreases in interest income were partially offset by $19 million of interest earned from our loan and senior unsecured notes investments in 2012 (see Notes 7 and 10,
respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

Interest expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, interest expense increased $734,000 to $417 million. The increase was
primarily
due to an increase of $13 million resulting from our senior unsecured notes offerings, net of related maturities of certain senior unsecured notes during 2011 and 2012. The increase was offset
by the $11 million write-off of unamortized loan fees related to a terminated bridge loan commitment in 2011 and a decrease resulting from the payoff of certain mortgage debt during
2011.

Our
exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is substantially mitigated by our interest rate swap contracts. For a more detailed discussion of our
interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

$86 million of variable-rate mortgages and £137 million ($223 million) term loan are presented as fixed-rate debt as the interest payments
under such debt have been swapped (pay fixed and receive float). At December 31, 2011, $88 million of variable-rate mortgages are presented as fixed-rate debt as
the interest payments under such debt have been swapped (pay fixed and receive float); the interest rates for swapped debt are presented at the swapped rates.

Depreciation and amortization expense.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $8 million to $358 million for the
year ended
December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily the result of additive effects of our acquisitions during 2011 and 2012.

General and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses decreased $17 million to $79 million for the year
ended
December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to an insurance recovery of $7 million during 2012 for previously incurred legal expenses and a decrease of $8 million in
acquisition costs incurred during 2012 compared to similar costs incurred during 2011.

Litigation settlement and provision.

On November 9, 2011, we entered into an agreement with Ventas to settle all remaining claims
relating to
Ventas's litigation against us arising out of Ventas's 2007 acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living REIT. As part of the settlement, we paid $125 million to Ventas, which resulted in a charge for
the same amount (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). No similar charges were recognized during the year
ended December 31, 2012.

Impairments (recoveries).

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment of $8 million as a result of
the
disposition of a life science land parcel (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized an
impairment of $15 million related to a senior secured term loan as a result of concluding that the carrying value of the loan was in excess of the fair value of the related collateral
supporting the loan (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

Other income, net.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, other income, net decreased $10 million to $3 million. The
decrease was
primarily the result of a gain of $8 million resulting from our acquisition of our partner's 65% interest in and consolidation of HCP Ventures II in January 2011



(see
Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and $6 million received in connection with a litigation settlement in June 2011 that represents proceeds
owed to us from a prior sale of assets. No similar gain upon consolidation was recognized or settlements were received during the year ended December 31, 2012. The decreases were partially
offset by a $5 million charge during the year ended December 31, 2011 for an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable equity securities.

Income taxes.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, income taxes decreased $3 million to a benefit of $2 million. The
decrease
in income taxes was primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from declines in taxable income of our TRS entities during the year ended December 31, 2012.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily the result of our 9.4%
equity
interest in HCR ManorCare. The October 2011 CMS reduction of skilled nursing reimbursements under Resource Utilization Group-Version 4 ("RUGs-IV"), together with changes in requirements
for the delivery of group therapy services, reduced HCR ManorCare's revenues and increased its therapy costs in 2012. HCR ManorCare partially mitigated these adverse impacts through a cost reduction
program. Further, HCR ManorCare experienced increased exposure to general and professional liability claims resulting in higher charges in 2012, which, together with the circumstances discussed above,
reduced our share in the earnings from our equity interest in HCR ManorCare.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased $8 million to $54 million. This increase primarily was the result
of the full-year share of earnings from our interest in HCR ManorCare, Inc. compared to a partial-year in 2011 (see Notes 3 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information). The Company's share of earnings from HCR ManorCare (equity income) increases for the corresponding reduction of related lease expense recognized at the HCR
ManorCare level.

Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $34 million, compared
to
$7 million for the comparable period in 2011. The increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $28 million, partially offset by a decline in operating
income from discontinued operations of $2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold real estate investments for $151 million, compared to $19 million for
the year ended December 31, 2011.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2011 to the Year Ended December 31, 2010

Segment NOI and Adjusted NOI

The tables below provide selected operating information for our SPP and total property portfolio for each of our five business
segments. Our consolidated SPP consists of 550 properties representing properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized on or prior to January 1, 2010 and that remained in operations
under a consistent reporting structure through December 31,
2011. Our consolidated total property portfolio represents 932 and 566 properties at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and excludes properties classified as discontinued operations.

SPP NOI and Adjusted NOI.

SPP NOI increased primarily as a result of rent escalations related to new leases or leases not subject to
straight-line rents. SPP NOI includes a decline in resident fees and services and operating expenses as a result of the consolidation of 27 properties in four variable interest entities
from August 31, 2010 to November 1, 2010 (see Notes 12 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statement s for additional information regarding these VIEs). SPP adjusted NOI improved
primarily as a result of annual rent escalations and an increase in rental revenues from properties transitioned from Sunrise to other operators.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

Including the impact of our SPP, our total portfolio NOI and adjusted NOI for the year ended
December 31, 2011 primarily increased as a result of 66 senior housing leased properties classified as DFLs that were acquired on April 7, 2011 from HCR ManorCare.

Additionally,
HCP Ventures II was consolidated on January 14, 2011 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), resulting in us
recognizing rental and related revenues for the 25 leased properties commencing on that date. On September 1, 2011, for 21 of these 25 properties, we entered into management contracts in a
structure permitted by RIDEA (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), resulting in the termination of the properties' leases. For these 21 properties
that are now in a RIDEA structure, the



resident-level
revenues and related operating expenses are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning on that date.

SPP NOI and Adjusted NOI.

SPP NOI increased primarily as a result of annual rent escalations on leases not subject to straight-line
rents. SPP adjusted NOI primarily increased as a result of annual rent escalations, partially offset by a decline due to deferred rent payments in 2010 that did not reoccur in 2011.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

Including the impact from our SPP, our total portfolio NOI increased primarily as a result of the
additive
effect of our life science acquisitions during 2010 and 2011.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011, 949,000 square feet of new and renewal leases commenced at an average annual base rent of $24.32 per square foot compared to 852,000
square feet of expiring and terminated leases with an average annual base rent of $24.62 per square foot. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we acquired 140,000 square feet with an
average annual base rent of $33.30 per square foot.

SPP Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

SPP NOI and adjusted NOI increased year-over-year primarily as a result of rent
escalations and an increase in medical office occupancy.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

In addition to the impact from SPP, total portfolio NOI and adjusted NOI increased
year-over-year as a result of the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions during 2010 and 2011.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011, 1.9 million square feet of new and renewal leases commenced at an average annual base rent of $22.01 per square foot compared to
1.8 million square feet of expiring and terminated leases with an average annual base rent of $22.92 per square foot. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we acquired 132,000 square
feet with an average annual base rent of $18.74 per square foot.

Other Income and Expense Items

Interest income.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, interest income decreased $60 million to $100 million as a result
of
decreases of income earned from and due to the settlement of our HCR ManorCare debt investments in 2011 of $58 million, a decrease of $12 million due to interest earned from marketable
debt securities that were sold in 2010 and a decline of $12 million of interest earned from our Delphis loan as it was placed on non-accrual status in 2011; these decreases were
partially offset by an increase of $35 million in interest earned and prepayment premiums and unamortized discounts recognized in April 2011 upon the early repayment of our loans to Genesis
HealthCare. For a more detailed description of our loan investments and marketable debt securities, see Notes 7 and 10, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment management fee income.

Investment management fee income decreased $3 million to $2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of acquiring our partner's 65% interest in HCP Ventures II on January 14, 2011, which resulted in the termination of the partnerships'
related management contracts.

Interest expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, interest expense increased $131 million to $416 million. The
increase in
interest expense was primarily due to a $111 million increase from our $2.4 billion senior unsecured notes offering in January 2011 as a result of prefunding activities from our



HCR
ManorCare Acquisition, the $11 million write-off of unamortized loan fees related to an expired bridge loan commitment and the consolidation of HCP Ventures II on
January 14, 2011 that included the consolidation of $635 million of mortgage debt, which increases were partially offset by the impact of repayments of mortgage debt related to
contractual maturities and senior unsecured notes during 2010 and 2011 and lower interest rates during 2011 as compared to 2010.

Our
exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is substantially mitigated by our interest rate swap contracts. For a more detailed discussion of our
interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

variable-rate mortgages are presented as fixed-rate debt as the interest payments under such debt have been swapped (pay fixed and receive float). At December 31, 2010,
$250 million of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes are presented as variable-rate debt as the interest payments under such debt has been swapped (pay float and receive
fixed) and $60 million of variable-rate mortgages are presented as fixed-rate debt as the interest payments under such debt have been swapped (pay fixed and receive
float); the interest rates for swapped debt are presented at the swapped rates.

Depreciation and amortization expense.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $43 million to $350 million for the
year ended
December 31, 2011. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to: (i) a $37 million increase as a result of the consolidation of HCP
Ventures II on January 14, 2011 and (ii) a $12 million increase from the additive effect of our other property acquisitions during 2010 and 2011.

General and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $13 million to $96 million for the year
ended
December 31, 2011. The increase in general and administrative expenses was a result of increases in acquisition costs, primarily attributable to our HCR ManorCare Acquisition and compensation
related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees associated with litigation matters (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Litigation settlement and provision.

On November 9, 2011, we entered into an agreement with Ventas to settle all remaining claims
relating to
Ventas's litigation against us arising out of Ventas's 2007 acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living REIT. As part of the settlement, we paid $125 million to



Ventas,
which resulted in a charge for the same amount (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). No similar
charges were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Impairments (recoveries).

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized an impairment of $15 million related to our
Delphis
senior secured term loan as a result of concluding that the carrying value of this loan was in excess of the fair value of the related collateral supporting this loan (see Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).

During
the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized aggregate income of $12 million, which represents impairment recoveries of portions of impairment charges recognized
in 2009 of investments related to Erickson Retirement Communities and its affiliate entities ("Erickson"). Erickson was the tenant at three of our senior housing CCRC DFLs and the borrower of a senior
construction loan in which we had a participation interest (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other income, net.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, other income, net decreased $3 million to $13 million. The year
ended
December 31, 2011, included the net impact of the following: (i) a gain of $8 million resulting from our January 2011 acquisition of our partner's 65% interest in and
consolidation of HCP Ventures II, (ii) income of $6 million in connection with a litigation settlement in June 2011 for proceeds owed to the Company from a sale of assets, and
(iii) a charge of $5 million for an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable equity securities. The year ended December 31, 2010 included gains on
marketable securities of $15 million.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, equity income from unconsolidated joint
ventures
increased $42 million to $47 million. This increase was primarily a result of equity income from our 9.4% interest in HCR ManorCare (see Notes 3 and 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information), partially offset by the impact of our consolidation of HCP Ventures II on January 14, 2011, which was previously accounted for as an
equity method investment.

Impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized impairments of
$72 million related to our 35% interest in HCP Ventures II, an unconsolidated joint venture that owned 25 senior housing properties previously leased by Horizon Bay (see Note 8 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements). No similar impairments were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2011.

Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $7 million, compared to
$29 million for the comparable period in 2010. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of $17 million and a decline in operating income from
discontinued operations of $5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold properties for $19 million, compared to $56 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund recurring operating expenses, (ii) meet debt service requirements,
including $550 million of senior unsecured notes and $292 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2013, (iii) fund capital expenditures, including tenant
improvements and leasing costs, (iv) fund acquisition and development activities, and (v) make dividend distributions. We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the
next 12 months will be adequate to fund our business operations, debt service payments, recurring capital expenditures and cash dividends to shareholders. Capital requirements relating to
maturing indebtedness, acquisitions and development activities may require funding from borrowings and/or equity and debt offerings.



Access
to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the
issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. For example, as noted below, our revolving line
of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings. We also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon
our debt ratings. As of February 11, 2013, we had a credit rating of BBB+ from Fitch, Baa1 from Moody's and BBB+ from S&P on our senior unsecured debt securities.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $1 billion and $724 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in operating
cash flows is primarily the result of the following: (i) the additive impact of our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012, (ii) assets placed in service in 2011 and 2012 and (iii) rent
escalations and resets in 2011 and 2012, which increases were partially offset by increased debt interest payments. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of
multi-tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors.

The
following are significant investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012:

•

acquired $1.9 billion of real estate, including the $1.7 billion Blackstone JV acquisition;

•

purchased $215 million (£137 million) of senior unsecured notes and funded $219 million
of loans;

•

raised $3.5 billion of debt and equity capital to fund, among other things, the aforementioned investments, repay
debt totaling $860 million and redeem preferred securities for $296 million; and

•

paid dividends on common and preferred stock of $865 million, which are generally funded by cash provided by our
operating activities.

Debt

Bank line of credit and Term Loan.

On March 27, 2012, we executed an amendment to our existing
$1.5 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility (the "Facility"). This amendment reduces the cost of the Facility (lower borrowing rate and facility fee) and extends the Facility's
maturity by one additional year to March 2016. The Facility contains a one-year extension option. Borrowings under this Facility accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin that depends upon
our debt ratings. We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends on our debt ratings. Based on our debt ratings at February 11, 2013, the margin on the Facility was
1.075%, and the facility fee was 0.175%. The Facility also includes a feature that will allow us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, subject to
securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions.

On
July 30, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million ($223 million at December 31, 2012)
four-year unsecured Term Loan (the "Term Loan") that accrues interest at a rate of GBP LIBOR plus 1.20%, based on our current debt ratings. Concurrent with the closing of the Term Loan, we
entered into a four-year interest rate swap agreement that fixed the rate of the Term Loan at 1.81%, subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings. The Term Loan contains a
one-year committed extension option.

Our
Facility and Term Loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreements
(i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio



of
Secured Debt to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30%, (iii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 60%, (iv) require a minimum Fixed Charge
Coverage ratio of 1.5 times and (v) require a formula-determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $9.2 billion at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, we were
in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the Facility and Term Loan.

Our
Facility also contains cross-default provisions to other indebtedness of ours, including in some instances, certain mortgages on our properties. Certain mortgages contain default
provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants, including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of
such operator or tenant. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs, such a default may result in
significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences.

Senior unsecured notes.

At December 31, 2012, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of
$6.7 billion. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 1.21% to 7.07% with a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.10% and a weighted average maturity of six years at December 31,
2012. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt, maintenance of unencumbered assets, cross-acceleration provisions and other customary terms. At
December 31, 2012, we believe we were in compliance with these covenants.

Mortgage debt.

At December 31, 2012, we had $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding that is
secured by
135 healthcare facilities (including redevelopment properties) with a carrying value of $2.1 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 1.54% to 8.69% with a weighted average
effective interest rate of 6.13% and a weighted average maturity of four years at December 31, 2012.

Mortgage
debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by certain properties and is generally non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically
restricts transfer of the encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the assets in good condition, requires
maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also cross-collateralized by multiple
properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets.

Other debt.

At December 31, 2012, we had $82 million of non-interest bearing life care bonds at two of our continuing care
retirement communities and non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at two of our senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities
(collectively, "Life Care Bonds"). The Life Care Bonds are refundable to the residents upon the termination of the contract or upon the successful resale of the unit.

Equity

At December 31, 2012, we had 453 million shares of common stock outstanding. At December 31, 2012, equity totaled
$10.8 billion, and our equity securities had a market value of $20.7 billion.

As
of December 31, 2012, there were a total of four million DownREIT units outstanding in four limited liability companies in which we are the managing member. The DownREIT units
are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain
adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications).



Shelf Registration

We have a prospectus that we filed with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S-3ASR, using a shelf
registration process which expires in July 2015. Under the "shelf" process, we may sell any combination of the securities in one or more offerings. The securities described in the prospectus include
common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities and warrants.

The
prospectus only provides a general description of the securities we may offer. The prospectus may not be used to sell securities unless accompanied by a prospectus supplement or a
free writing prospectus. Each time we sell securities under the shelf registration, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities
being offered and of the offering. The prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in the prospectus.

We
may offer and sell the securities pursuant to the prospectus through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, on a continuous or delayed basis. The securities may
also be resold by selling security holders. The prospectus supplement for each offering will describe in detail the plan of distribution for that offering and will set forth the names of any
underwriters, dealers or agents involved in the offering and any applicable fees, commissions or discount arrangements. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sales of the securities as set forth
in the applicable prospectus supplement, and unless otherwise set forth in a therein, we will not receive any proceeds if the securities are sold by a selling security holder.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure—Funds From Operations ("FFO")

We believe FFO applicable to common shares, diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and basic and diluted FFO per common share are
important supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes
straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead
have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO
was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.

FFO
is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from acquisition and dispositions of depreciable real estate or
related interests, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures
are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash
needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition; however,
other REITs may report FFO differently or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from us. In addition, we present FFO before the impact of litigation settlement charges,
preferred stock redemption charges, impairments (recoveries) of non-depreciable assets and merger-related items (defined below) ("FFO as adjusted"). Management believes FFO as adjusted is
a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP).

Details
of certain items that affect comparability are discussed under

Results of Operations

above. The following is a reconciliation from
net income applicable to common shares, the most direct



comparable
financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO and FFO as adjusted (in thousands, except per share data):

In
connection with the redemption of our preferred stock, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred a redemption charge of
$10.4 million related to the original issuance costs.

The
litigation settlement charge during the year ended December 31, 2011 relates to the Ventas settlement.

(3)

The
following impairments, net of recoveries had an impact on FFO:

•

The impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2012 relates to the
sale of a land parcel in our life science segment.

•

The impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2011 relates to our
senior secured loan to Delphis.

•

Recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2010 relate to portions of
previous impairment charges related to investments in three direct financing leases (non-depreciable due to lessee purchase option) and a participation interest in a senior construction
loan related to Erickson.

The
year ended December 31, 2012 merger-related items of $0.02 per share attributable to the Senior Housing Portfolio acquisition include direct
transaction costs and the impact of the negative carry of prefunding the transaction with the $1.0 billion, or 22 million shares, common stock offering completed on October 19,
2012 on the calculation of weighted average shares. Proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Senior Housing Portfolio Acquisition. Merger-related items for the year ended December 31,
2011 are attributable to our HCR ManorCare Acquisition (incurred from January 1st through April 6th 2011), which include the following: (i) $26.8 million of
direct transaction costs, (ii) $23.9 million of interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion senior unsecured notes issued on January 24, 2011, proceeds from which
were obtained to prefund the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, partially offset by (iii) $24.1 million of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the our debt investment in HCR
ManorCare and other miscellaneous items. Merger-related items for 2010 primarily include professional fees associated with our HCR ManorCare Acquisition.

(5)

Our
weighted average shares used to calculate diluted FFO as adjusted eliminate the impact of 46 million shares of common stock from our December
2010 offering and 30 million shares from our March 2011 common stock offering (excludes 4.5 million shares sold to the underwriters upon exercise of their option to purchase additional
shares), which issuances increased our weighted average shares by 12.9 million and 1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Proceeds from these
offerings were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as
collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our risk of loss for these certain
properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity
and capital resources except those described below under

Interest
on variable-rate debt is calculated using rates in effect at December 31, 2012.

Inflation

Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other
measures, and/or additional rent based on increases in the tenants' operating revenues. Most of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes,
insurance and utilities. Substantially all of our senior housing, life science, post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property
operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent
increases described above.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards. There were no accounting
pronouncements that were issued, but not yet adopted by us, that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not
use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. See Note 24 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

To
illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments. We applied various basis
point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments' change in fair value. Assuming a one
percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates, the estimated change



in
fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed $8 million. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional analysis details.

Interest Rate Risk.

At December 31, 2012, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on properties
with a gross
value of $83 million that are subject to leases where the payments fluctuate with changes in LIBOR (excludes $223 million of variable-rate senior unsecured notes that have
been hedged through interest-rate swap contracts). Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable-rate investments is partially offset by:
(i) $25 million of variable-rate senior unsecured notes and (ii) $15 million of variable-rate mortgage debt payable (excludes $86 million of
variable-rate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interest-rate swap contracts). Additionally, our exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates
excludes our GBP denominated $223 million (£137 million) variable-rate Term Loan that has been hedged through interest-rate swap contracts.

Interest
rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated.
However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings
and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable-rate investments and
variable-rate debt, and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2012, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately
$0.3 million, or less than $0.01 per common share on a diluted basis.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.

At December 31, 2012, our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to forecasted
interest
receipts from our GBP denominated senior unsecured notes (see additional discussion of the Four Seasons Health Care Senior Unsecured Notes in Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Our foreign currency exchange exposure is mitigated by the forecasted interest and principal payments from our GBP denominated unsecured Term Loan (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information) and a foreign currency swap contract for approximately 85% of the forecasted interest receipts from our senior unsecured notes through the non-call
period which ends on June 15, 2016.

Market Risk.

We have investments in marketable debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, because we have the positive
intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts
through maturity. We consider a variety of factors in evaluating an other-than-temporary decline in value, such as: the length of time and the extent to which the market value
has been less than our current adjusted carrying value; the issuer's financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects; any recent events specific to that issuer and economic
conditions of its industry; and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated near-term recovery in the market value, if any. At December 31, 2012, the fair value and
adjusted carrying value of marketable debt securities were $234 million and $223 million, respectively.

We
have investments in marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale. Gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized,
and losses are recognized when an other-than-temporary decline in value is identified. An initial indicator of an other-than-temporary decline in value
for marketable equity securities is based on the severity of the decline in market value below the cost basis for an extended period of time. We consider a variety of factors in evaluating an
other-than-temporary decline in value, such as: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current cost basis; the issuer's financial
condition, capital strength and near-term prospects; any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry; and our investment horizon in relationship to an
anticipated near-term recovery in the market value, if



any.
At December 31, 2012, the fair value and adjusted cost basis of marketable equity securities were $25 million and $17 million, respectively.

The
principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value for our senior
unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices. The fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates
for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.

See Index to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

ITEM 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures

None.

ITEM 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be
disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our



Chief
Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Also,
we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain
with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal
Financial Officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2012, at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2012 to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonable
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

,
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of HCP, Inc.

Long Beach, California

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
financial statement schedules and
included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05,

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of HCP, Inc.

Long Beach, California

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of presentation for comprehensive income due to the adoption of Accounting
Standards Update No. 2011-05,

Presentation of Comprehensive Income

.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)   Business

HCP, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a Maryland corporation that is organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, together
with its consolidated entities (collectively, "HCP" or the "Company"), invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. The Company acquires, develops, leases,
manages and disposes of healthcare real estate and provides financing to healthcare providers.

(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

Management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from management's estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures or variable
interest entities that it controls through voting
rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

The
Company is required to continually evaluate its VIE relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations. A VIE is
broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most
significantly impact the entity's economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial
support.

A
variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact
the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company
qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, the Company's ability to direct the activities that
most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the VIE's governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability and the
rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity.

For
its investments in joint ventures, the Company evaluates the type of ownership rights held by the limited partner(s) that may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the
sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership. The assessment of limited partners' rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the
sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of
the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of
outstanding limited partnership interests. The Company similarly evaluates the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes rental revenue when the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the
lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes,
are owned by the tenant or the Company. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of
the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded by the Company is
treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to, the
following criteria:

•

whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;

•

whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;

•

whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and

•

whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term.

Certain
leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized
when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds, and only after the contingency has been removed (when the related thresholds are
achieved). This may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received.

Tenant
recoveries related to the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses
are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented gross, as the Company is generally the primary obligor and, with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, has
discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk.

For
leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, the Company recognizes income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured.
Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in recognized
revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If the Company determines that collectibility of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, the Company
limits future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, establishes an allowance for estimated losses.

Resident
fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges, community fees and other resident charges. Residency agreements are generally for
a term of 30 days to one year, with resident fees billed monthly. Revenue for certain care related services is recognized as services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears.

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or
the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. The Company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This
evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, the Company's assessment is based on
amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.

F-9


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
Company uses the direct finance method of accounting to record income from direct financing leases ("DFLs"). For leases accounted for as DFLs, the future minimum lease payments are
recorded as a receivable. Unearned income represents the net investment in the DFL, less the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties.
Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented
net of unamortized and unearned income.

Loans
receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Loans
held-for-investment are carried at amortized cost and are reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses as necessary. The Company recognizes interest income on
loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the interest method. The interest method is applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectibility of the future
payments is reasonably assured. Premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans. Loans are transferred from held-for-investment to
held-for-sale when management's intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future. Loans held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost
or fair value.

The
Company receives management fees from its investments in certain joint venture entities for various services it provides as the managing member. Management fees are recorded as
revenue when management services have been performed. Intercompany profit for management fees is eliminated.

The
Company recognizes gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of a transaction with the purchaser. Gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when the
collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, the Company is not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant, the initial investment from the buyer is
sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.

Allowances
are established for loans and DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is
deemed probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. An allowance is based upon the Company's assessment of the
borrower's or lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable
value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's or DFL's effective interest rate, fair value
of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors, as appropriate.

Loans
and DFLs are placed on non-accrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on
non-accrual status, loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, in which all
cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or DFL, based on the Company's expectation of future collectibility.

Real Estate

The Company's real estate assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements are recorded at their then fair value at the time of
consolidation. The assumed liabilities, acquired tangible assets and identifiable intangibles are also recorded at their then fair value. The Company assesses fair value based on cash flow projections
that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available

F-10


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

market
information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, as well as market and economic conditions. The
fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property is based on the value of the property as if it is vacant.

The
Company records acquired "above and below market" leases at their fair value using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is
based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market
lease rates for each in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with
bargain renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each
property and the respective tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute
similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes estimates of lost rents at estimated market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent
on local market conditions and expected trends. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.

The
Company capitalizes direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to
the acquisition, development or construction of a real estate asset. The Company capitalizes construction and development costs while substantive activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its
intended use. The Company considers a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of company owned tenant improvements, but no later than one
year from cessation of significant construction activity. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, or after development activities have ceased, are
expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the Company capitalizes costs based on the net carrying value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for
the construction and improvement incurred in connection with the redevelopment. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings. Expenditures for
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company considers costs incurred in conjunction with re-leasing properties, including tenant improvements and lease commissions, to
represent the acquisition of productive assets and, accordingly, such costs are reflected as investing activities in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.

The
Company computes depreciation on properties using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful life. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is
identified as held-for-sale. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over useful lives ranging up to 50 years. Above and below market lease intangibles are amortized
primarily to revenue over the remaining noncancellable lease terms and bargain renewal periods, if any.
In-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining noncancellable lease term and bargain renewal periods, if any.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company tests its real estate assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the
expected future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the real estate asset or asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows,

F-11


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

an
impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the carrying value of the real estate asset or asset group to its fair value.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at least annually. If it is determined, based on certain qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount, the Company applies the second step of the two-step approach. Potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real
estate valuations, restructuring plans, current macroeconomic conditions, state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of the Company's market capitalization. The
second step of the two-step approach requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a
business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to
determine the amount of impairment. The Company selected the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to perform its annual impairment test.

Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued Operations

Certain long-lived assets are classified as held-for-sale and are reported at the lower of their
carrying value or
their fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. Discontinued operations is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is deemed to be
held-for-sale and, (i) the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction,
and (ii) the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which the Company does not consolidate but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company's share of the investee's earnings or losses are included in the Company's
consolidated results of operations.

The
initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the fair value of the assets prior to the
sale of interests in the joint venture. To the extent that the Company's cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is generally amortized over
the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in the Company's share of equity in earnings of the joint venture. The Company evaluates its equity method
investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When the Company determines a decline in the fair value of an investment in
an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. The Company recognizes gains on the sale of interests in joint
ventures to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

The
Company's fair values for its equity method investments are based on discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period
and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums or discounts. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon assumptions that the Company believes
to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Share-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for share-based awards granted to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the
consolidated statements of income based on their grant date fair market value. Compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules is generally recognized ratably over the period from the
grant date to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional services.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less when
purchased.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts held by mortgage lenders to provide for (i) real estate tax expenditures, tenant
improvements and capital expenditures, and (ii) security deposits and net proceeds from property sales that were executed as tax-deferred dispositions.

Derivatives

During its normal course of business, the Company uses certain types of derivative instruments for the purpose of managing interest
rate and currency risk. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivative instruments used for risk management purposes must effectively reduce the risk exposure that they are designed to hedge. In
addition, at inception of a qualifying cash flow hedging relationship, the underlying transaction or transactions, must be, and are expected to remain, probable of occurring in accordance with the
Company's related assertions.

The
Company recognizes all derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives required to be bifurcated, as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair
value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the criteria of hedge accounting are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated
in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships, the change in fair value of the effective portion of the derivatives is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), whereas the change
in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships, the change in fair value of the effective portion of the
derivatives offsets the change in fair value of the hedged item, whereas the change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings.

The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions. This process includes designating all derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship to specific forecasted transactions as well as recognized obligations or assets in the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company also assesses and documents, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives that are designated in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the designated risks associated with the respective hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective as a
hedge, or that it is probable the underlying forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and records the appropriate adjustment to earnings based on
the current fair value of the derivative.

Income Taxes

HCP, Inc. elected REIT status and believes it has always operated so as to continue to qualify as a REIT under
Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Accordingly, HCP, Inc. will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that it continues to
qualify as a REIT and makes distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of its taxable income. In addition, the Company has formed several consolidated subsidiaries, which have elected REIT
status. HCP, Inc. and its consolidated REIT subsidiaries are each subject to the REIT qualification requirements under Sections 856 to 860 of the Code. If any REIT fails to qualify as a
REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years.

HCP, Inc.
and its consolidated REIT subsidiaries are subject to state and local income taxes in some jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances each REIT may also be subject to
federal excise taxes on
undistributed income. In addition, certain activities that the Company undertakes may be conducted by entities which elect to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). TRSs are subject to both
federal and state income taxes. The Company recognizes tax penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as additional income tax expense. Interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits is
recognized as interest expense.

Marketable Securities

The Company classifies its marketable equity securities as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at
their fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined
based on the specific identification method. When the Company determines declines in fair value of marketable securities are other-than-temporary, a loss is recognized in
earnings.

The
Company classifies its marketable debt securities as held-to-maturity, because the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to
maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity.

Capital Raising Issuance Costs

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of common shares are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of preferred shares are recorded as a reduction of the preferred stock amount. Debt issuance costs are deferred, included in other assets and amortized
to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt utilizing the interest method.

Segment Reporting

The Company's segments are based on its internal method of reporting which classifies operations by healthcare sector. The Company's
business operations include five segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital.

Noncontrolling Interests

The Company reports arrangements with noncontrolling interests as a component of equity separate from the parent's equity. The Company
accounts for purchases or sales of equity interests that

F-14


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

do
not result in a change in control as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated
statements of income and, upon a gain or loss of control, the interest purchased or sold, as well as any interest retained, is recorded at its fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.

The
Company consolidates non-managing member limited liability companies ("DownREITs") because it exercises control, and noncontrolling interests in these entities are
carried at cost. The non-managing member LLC Units ("DownREIT units") are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of the
Company's common stock or, at the Company's option, shares of the Company's common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). Upon exchange of DownREIT units
for the Company's common stock, the carrying amount of the DownREIT units is reclassified to stockholders' equity.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into U.S. dollars use exchange rates in effect at the end
of the period, and revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into U.S. dollars use average rates of exchange in effect during the related period. Gains or losses
resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The effects of transaction gains or losses are included in other income,
net in the consolidated statements of income.

Preferred Stock Redemptions

The Company recognizes the excess of the redemption value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock redeemed over its carrying amount as
a charge to earnings.

Life Care Bonds Payable

Certain of the Company's continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs") issue non-interest bearing life care bonds
payable to certain residents of the CCRCs. Generally, the bonds are refundable to the resident or to the resident's estate upon termination or cancellation of the CCRC agreement or upon the successful
resale of the unit. Proceeds from the issuance of new bonds are used to retire existing bonds, and since the maturity of the obligations for the facilities is not determinable, no interest is imputed.
These amounts are included in other debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Fair Value Measurement

The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of
valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from
independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These inputs have created the
following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1

—quoted prices for

identical

instruments in active markets;

F-15


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

•

Level 2

—quoted prices for

similar

instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations
in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and

•

Level 3

—fair value measurements derived from valuation
techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are

unobservable

.

The
Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value. When
available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1. In some instances where a market price
is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and classifies the
asset or liability in Level 2.

If
quoted market prices or inputs are not available, fair value measurements are based upon valuation models that utilize current market or independently sourced market inputs, such as
interest rates, option volatilities, credit spreads and/or market capitalization rates. Items valued using such internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 even though there may be some significant
inputs that are readily observable. Internal fair value models and techniques used by the Company include discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes valuation models. The Company also considers its
counterparty's and own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at their fair value. The Company has elected the mid-market pricing expedient when determining fair value.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company accounts for unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(whether paid or unpaid) as participating securities, which are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Diluted earnings per common share is
calculated by including the effect of dilutive and preferred securities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")
No. 2013-02,

Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

("ASU 2013-02"). The
amendments in this update require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to
present, either on the face of the income statement or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income by the net income line item. The Company does not
expect the adoption of ASU 2013-02 on January 1, 2013 to have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In
July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02,

Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment

("ASU
2012-02"). The amendments in this update provide an entity with the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired to
determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test. The adoption of ASU 2012-02 on January 1, 2013 did not have an impact on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

("ASU 2012-01"). This update clarifies the situations in which recognition of deferred revenue for refundable advance fees is appropriate. The Company does not
expect the adoption of ASU 2012-01 on January 1, 2013 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In
June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05,

Presentation of Comprehensive Income

("ASU 2011-05").
The amendments require that all non-owner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive
statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total
other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income. In December 2011, the FASB deferred portions of this update in its issuance of
Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-12 (see discussion above). The Company has elected the two-statement approach and the required financial statements are presented
herein.

In
May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04,

Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in
U.S. GAAP and IFRSs

("ASU 2011-04"). The amendments in this update result in additional fair value measurement and disclosure requirements within
U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments update the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for
disclosing information about fair value measurements. The
adoption of ASU 2011-04 on January 1, 2012 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the Company's consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation. Assets sold or held-for-sale and associated liabilities have been reclassified on the consolidated balance sheets and operating results reclassified from continuing to
discontinued operations.

(3)   HCR ManorCare Acquisition

On April 7, 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of HCR ManorCare, Inc. ("HCR ManorCare"), for
a purchase price of $6.0 billion (the "HCR ManorCare Acquisition"). The purchase price consisted of the following: (i) $4 billion in cash consideration; and
(ii) $2 billion representing the fair value of the Company's HCR ManorCare debt investments that were settled as part of this acquisition. Through this transaction, the Company acquired
334 HCR ManorCare post-acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The facilities are located in 30 states, with the highest concentrations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida,
Illinois and Michigan. A wholly-owned subsidiary of HCR ManorCare operates the assets pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement supported by a guaranty from HCR
ManorCare. Additionally, the Company exercised its option to purchase an ownership interest of HCR ManorCare for $95 million that represented a 9.9% equity interest at closing.

$1.7 Billion Senior Housing Portfolio Acquisition

During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company acquired 129 senior housing communities for $1.7 billion, from a joint venture
between Emeritus Corporation ("Emeritus")
and Blackstone Real Estate Partners VI, an affiliate of Blackstone (the "Blackstone JV"). Located in 29 states, the portfolio encompasses 10,077 units representing a diversified care mix of 61%
assisted living, 25% independent living, 13% memory care and 1% skilled nursing. Based on operating performance at closing, the 129 communities consist of 95 that are stabilized and 34 that were in
lease-up. The transaction closed in two stages: (i) 127 senior housing facilities on October 31, 2012 for $1.68 billion representing 9,842 units; and (ii) two senior
housing facilities on December 4, 2012 for $24 million representing 235 units. The Company paid $1.7 billion in cash consideration to acquire: (i) real estate with a fair
value of $1.5 billion, (ii) intangible assets with a fair value of $170 million and assumed intangible liabilities with a fair value of $4 million. As of
December 31, 2012, the purchase price allocation is preliminary, and the final purchase price allocation will be determined pending the receipt of information necessary to complete the
valuation of certain assets and liabilities, which may result in a change from the initial estimate.

Emeritus
operates the communities pursuant to a new triple-net, master lease for the 129 properties (the "Master Lease") guaranteed by Emeritus. The Master Lease provides
aggregate contractual rent in the first year of $103.6 million. The contractual rent will increase annually by the greater of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") or 3.7%
on average over the initial five years, and thereafter by the greater of CPI or 3.0% for the remaining initial lease term. At the beginning of the sixth lease year, rent on the 34 lease-up
properties will increase to the greater of the percentage increase in CPI or fair market, subject to a floor of 103% and a cap of 130% of the prior year's rent. From the acquisition dates to
December 31, 2012, the Company recognized income of $22 million related to its acquisitions of the 129 senior housing communities.

The
leased properties are grouped into three pools that share comparable characteristics and these leased pools have initial terms of 14 to 16 years. Emeritus has two extension
options, which, if exercised, will provide for lease terms of 30 to 35 years.

Concurrent
with the acquisition, Emeritus purchased nine communities from the Blackstone JV, for which the Company provided secured debt financing of $52 million with a
four-year term. The loan is secured by the underlying real estate and is prepayable at Emeritus' option. The interest rate on the loan was initially 6.1% and will gradually increase during
its four year term to 6.8%.

the remaining portion of the initial lease term. The properties are grouped into four pools, and HCR ManorCare has a one-time extension option for each pool with rent increased for the
first year of the extension option to the greater of fair market rent or a 3% increase over the rent for the prior year. Including the extension options, which the Company determined to be bargain
renewal options, the four leased pools had total initial available terms ranging from 23 to 35 years.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On April 7, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of 334 HCR ManorCare properties subject to a single master lease that the Company
classified as a DFL. See discussion of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition in Note 3.

Certain
leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial investment amount plus
adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements. Certain leases also permit the Company to require the tenants to purchase the properties at the end of the lease terms.

Lease
payments previously due to the Company relating to three land-only DFLs, along with the land, were subordinate to and served as collateral for first mortgage
construction loans entered into by Erickson Retirement Communities and its affiliate entities ("Erickson") to fund development costs related to the properties. On October 19, 2009, Erickson
filed for bankruptcy protection, which included a plan of reorganization. In December 2009, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to reduce the carrying value of these assets to a nominal
amount. In February 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Erickson which was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court. In April 2010, the reorganization was completed, which
resulted in the Company (i) retaining deposits held by the Company with balances of $5 million and (ii) receiving an additional $9.6 million. As a result, the Company
recognized aggregate income of $11.9 million in impairment recoveries in 2010, which represented the reversal of a portion of the allowances established pursuant to the previous December 2009
impairment charges of $63.1 million related to its investments in the three DFLs and participation interest in the senior construction loan.

Other Secured Loans

Tandem Health Care Loan.

On July 31, 2012, the Company closed a mezzanine loan facility to lend up to $205 million to Tandem
Health
Care ("Tandem"), an affiliate of Formation Capital, as part of the recapitalization of a post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio. The Company funded $100 million (the "First Tranche")
at closing and has a commitment to fund an additional $105 million (the "Second Tranche") between February 2013 and August 2013. The Second Tranche will be used to repay
debt senior to the Company's loan. At closing, the loan was subordinate to $400 million in senior mortgage debt and $137 million in senior mezzanine debt. The loan bears interest at a
fixed rate of 12% and 14% per annum for the First and Second Tranche, respectively. The facility has a total term of up to 63 months from the initial closing, is prepayable at the borrower's option
and is secured by real estate partnership interests.

Delphis Operations, L.P. Loan.

The Company holds a secured term loan made to Delphis Operations, L.P.
("Delphis" or the "Borrower") that is collateralized by all of the assets of the Borrower. The Borrower's collateral is comprised primarily of interests in partnerships operating surgical facilities,
some of which are on the premises of properties owned by the Company or HCP Ventures IV, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture of the Company. In December 2009, the Company
determined that the loan was impaired. Further, in January 2011 the Company placed the loan on cost-recovery status, whereby accrual of interest income was suspended and any
payments received from the Borrower are applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan.

As
part of a March 2012 agreement (the "2012 Agreement") between Delphis, certain past and current principals of Delphis and the Cirrus Group, LLC (the "Guarantors"), and
the Company, the Company agreed, among other things, to allow the distribution of $1.5 million to certain of the Guarantors from funds generated from sales of assets that were pledged as
additional collateral for this loan. Further, the Company, as part of the 2012 Agreement, agreed to provide financial incentives to the Borrower regarding the liquidation of the primary collateral
assets for this loan.

Pursuant
to the aforementioned 2012 Agreement, the Company received the remaining cash ($4.8 million, after reducing this amount by $0.5 million for related legal expenses)
and other consideration ($2.1 million) of $6.9 million from the Guarantors. In addition, during 2012 the Company received $38.1 million in net proceeds from the sales of two of
the primary collateral assets, which proceeds, together with the cash payments and other consideration, have been applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. At December 31, 2012 and
2011, the carrying value of the loan was $30.7 million and $75.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2012, the Company believes the fair value of the collateral supporting this
loan is in excess of its carrying value. During the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company received cash payments of $43 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

In
September 2011 the Company recognized a total provision for losses of $15.4 million related to its Delphis loan that is discussed above;
$10.0 million of this provision reduced the carrying value of the loan and the remaining $5.4 million provision reduced the carrying value of the related accrued interest receivable
(accrued interest on loans is presented in other assets; see Note 10 for additional information).

HCR ManorCare Loans.

In December 2007, the Company made a $900 million investment (at a discount of $100 million) in HCR
ManorCare mezzanine loans, which paid interest at a floating rate of one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 4.0%. Also, in August 2009 and January 2011, the
Company purchased $720 million (at a discount of $130 million) and $360 million, respectively, in participations in HCR ManorCare first mortgage debt, which paid interest at LIBOR
plus 1.25%.

On
April 7, 2011, upon closing of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, the Company's $2.0 billion of loans to HCR ManorCare were settled, which resulted in additional interest
income of $23 million, which represents the excess of the loans' fair values above their carrying values at the acquisition date. See Note 3 for additional discussion related to the HCR
ManorCare Acquisition.

Genesis HealthCare Loans.

In September and October 2010, the Company purchased participations in a senior loan and mezzanine note
of Genesis
HealthCare ("Genesis") with par values of $278 million (at a discount of $28 million) and $50 million (at a discount of $10 million), respectively. The Genesis senior loan
paid interest at LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.5%, increasing to 2.5% by maturity) plus a spread of 4.75%, increasing to 5.75% by maturity. The senior loan was secured by all of Genesis' assets. The
mezzanine note paid interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 7.50%. In addition to the coupon interest payments, the mezzanine note required the payment of a termination fee, of which the Company's share
prior to the early repayment of this loan was $2.3 million.

On
April 1, 2011, the Company received $330.4 million from the early repayment of its loans to Genesis, and recognized additional interest income of $34.8 million,
which represents the related unamortized discounts and termination fee.

(3)

The
combined net loss for the year ended December 31, 2011, includes impairments, net of the related tax benefit, of $865 million related to
HCR ManorCare's goodwill and intangible assets. The impairments at the operating entity were the result of reduced cash flows primarily caused by the reimbursement reductions for the Medicare skilled
nursing facility Prospective Payment System announced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) effective October 1, 2011. These reimbursement reductions were previously
considered in the Company's underwriting assumptions for its initial investments in the operations of HCR ManorCare; therefore, the goodwill that was impaired was not part of the Company's basis in
its investment. As such, HCR ManorCare's impairments during the year ended December 31, 2011 did not have an impact on the Company's share of earnings from or its investment in HCR ManorCare.

(4)

Net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2010, includes an impairment of $54.5 million related to straight-line rent assets of HCP
Ventures II (the "Ventures"). Concurrently, during the year ended December 31, 2010 HCP recognized a $71.7 million impairment of its investment in the Ventures that was primarily
attributable to a reduction in the fair value of the Ventures' real estate assets and included the Company's share of the impact of the Ventures' impairment of its straight-line rent
assets. Therefore, HCP's share in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the impact of the Ventures' impairment of its straight-line rent assets was not included
in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures on the consolidated statements of income.

The
Company's joint venture interest in HCR ManorCare is accounted for using the equity method and results in an ongoing reduction of DFL income,
proportional to HCP's ownership in HCR ManorCare. The Company recorded a

Four Seasons Health Care Senior Unsecured Notes

On June 28, 2012, the Company purchased senior unsecured notes with an aggregate par value of £138.5 million
at a discount for £136.8 million ($214.9 million). The notes are issued by Elli Investments Limited, a subsidiary of Terra Firma, a European private equity firm, as part of
its financing for the acquisition of Four Seasons Health Care, an elderly and specialist care provider in the United Kingdom. The notes mature in June 2020 and are non-callable
through June 2016. The notes bear interest on their par value at a fixed rate of 12.25% per annum, with an original issue discount resulting in a yield to maturity of 12.5%. This investment was
financed by a GBP denominated unsecured term loan that is discussed in Note 11. These senior unsecured notes are accounted for as marketable debt securities and classified as
held-to-maturity.

(11) Debt

Bank Line of Credit and Term Loan

On March 27, 2012, the Company executed an amendment to its existing $1.5 billion unsecured revolving line of credit
facility (the "Facility"). This amendment reduces the cost of the Facility (lower borrowing rate and facility fee) and extends the Facility's maturity by one additional year to March 2016. The
Facility contains a one-year extension option. Borrowings under this Facility accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin that depends on the Company's debt ratings. The Company pays a facility
fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon its debt ratings. Based on the Company's debt ratings at December 31, 2012, the margin on the Facility was 1.075%, and the facility fee
was 0.175%. The Facility also includes a feature that will allow the Company to increase the Facility by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, subject to securing additional commitments
from existing lenders or new lending institutions. At December 31, 2012, the Company had no balance outstanding under this Facility.

On
July 30, 2012, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million ($223 million at December 31, 2012)
four-year unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") that accrues interest at a rate of GBP LIBOR plus 1.20%, based on the Company's current debt ratings. Concurrent with the closing of the
Term Loan, the Company entered into a four-year interest rate swap contract that fixes the interest rate of the Term Loan at 1.81%, subject to adjustments based on the Company's debt
ratings. The Term Loan contains a one-year committed extension option.

The
Facility and Term Loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements, including cross-default provisions to other indebtedness. Among other things, these
covenants, using terms defined in the agreements (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Secured Debt to
Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30%, (iii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 60%, (iv) require a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of
1.5 times and (v) require a formula-determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $9.2 billion at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, the Company was in
compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the Facility and Term Loan.

Senior Unsecured Notes

At December 31, 2012, the Company had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of
$6.7 billion. At December 31, 2012, interest rates on the notes ranged from 1.21% to 7.07% with a weighted average effective rate of 5.10% and a weighted average maturity of six years.

Mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally
non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered assets, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires
maintenance of the assets in good condition, requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into or terminate material leases. Some of the
mortgage debt is also cross-collateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets.

Other Debt

At December 31, 2012, the Company had $82 million of non-interest bearing life care bonds at two of its CCRCs
and non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at two of its senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively, "Life Care Bonds").
The Life Care Bonds are refundable to the residents upon the termination of the contract or upon the successful resale of the unit.

Company's business. Except as described in this Note 12, the Company is not aware of any other legal proceedings or claims that it believes may have, individually or taken together, a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company's policy is to accrue legal expenses as they are incurred.

On
May 3, 2007, Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas") filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging, among other
things, that the Company interfered with Ventas's prospective business advantage in connection with Ventas's 2007 acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT").
Ventas sought compensatory damages in excess of $300 million plus punitive damages. Prior to the jury deliberations, the District Court dismissed, among other rulings, Ventas's claim for
punitive damages. On September 4, 2009, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Ventas in the amount of approximately $102 million. The Company recognized $102 million as a
provision for litigation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2009. Both Ventas and the Company appealed various rulings of the District Court and the jury verdict to the United
States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. On May 17, 2011, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred by not submitting Ventas's claim for punitive damages to the jury,
and affirmed the District Court's judgment in all other respects. On August 23, 2011, the Company paid Ventas $102 million resulting from the jury verdict. On November 9, 2011,
the Company and Ventas settled all claims relating to the litigation and the Company paid $125 million to Ventas in addition to the $102 million paid in August 2011.

On
June 29, 2009, several of the Company's subsidiaries, together with three of its tenants, filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Court of Chancery") against
Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. and three of its subsidiaries ("Sunrise"). One of the complaints, which related to four of the 64 communities subject to the dispute, was removed on July 24,
2009 to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (the "Virginia District Court"). On April 30, 2010, the Virginia District Court dismissed all claims before it, and
each party filed a notice of appeal regarding the decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

On
August 31, 2010, the Company entered into agreements with Sunrise in which: (i) the Company acquired the right to terminate management contracts on 27 of the 75 senior
housing communities owned by the Company (these 27 communities were leased to tenants that had entered into
management contracts with Sunrise); (ii) Sunrise agreed to limit certain fees and charges associated with the in-place management contracts of the remaining 48 communities, where
such limitations were consistent with the parties' budgetary rights and obligations under existing agreements; (iii) the Company agreed to fund certain capital expenditures at the remaining 48
communities, and (iv) both parties dismissed all of the previous litigation proceedings that were filed against each other. The Company agreed to pay Sunrise $50 million for the right to
terminate the management contracts of the 27 communities; after taking into account the rights to approximately $9 million of working capital that the Company received in conjunction
with acquiring these termination rights, the net cost to acquire the termination rights was $41 million. The Company had marketed for lease the 27 communities to a limited group of
operators, and prior to August 31, 2010, had received a favorable bid and an executed non-binding term sheet from Emeritus Corporation ("Emeritus"). On October 18, 2010, the
Company executed two triple-net master leases with Emeritus for the 27 communities on terms consistent with a non-binding term sheet agreed to by the Company and
Emeritus in August 2010, including fixed lease terms of 15 years and two 10 year extension options. Shortly thereafter, on October 31, 2010, the Company exercised its rights under
the existing lease contracts to terminate the leases with the tenants that had entered into the management contracts with Sunrise for a payment of $2 million. The term of the new Emeritus
leases commenced on November 1, 2010, immediately after such termination.

The
Company capitalized the $41 million cost for the above termination rights as an initial direct leasing cost of the new leases as it determined that: (i) acquiring the
right to terminate Sunrise's long-term management contracts was essential to enable the Company to lease such communities to another operator; and (ii) prior to August 31,
2010, the leasing transaction with Emeritus was reasonably assured. The initial direct leasing costs will be amortized over the initial 15-year term of the new leases with Emeritus.
Further, the Company concluded that no amount of the $50 million paid to Sunrise should be allocated to the dismissed litigation or to the existing leases on the 48 remaining communities,
because the Company believed that: (i) as ruled by the Virginia District Court, Sunrise's counterclaims lacked merit and had no value, and the claims remaining in the Chancery Court arose from
similar facts and were expected to be decided on the basis of similar law; (ii) Sunrise's agreement to limit certain fees on the remaining 48 communities, and the Company's agreement to fund
certain capital expenditures at the communities, were each consistent with the Company's and Sunrise's obligations, respectively under the existing agreements; and (iii) the incremental value
gained by the reasonably assured future rents from Emeritus and the acquired working capital exceeded the payment to Sunrise.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of operators, tenants or obligors related to the Company's investments are engaged
in similar business activities, or activities
in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected by changes in
economic conditions. The Company regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio to assess potential concentrations of risks. The Company does not have significant foreign operations.

The
following table provides information regarding the Company's concentration with respect to certain operators; the information provided is presented for the gross assets and revenues
that are associated with certain operators as percentages of the respective segment's and total Company's gross assets and revenues:

As
of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Brookdale Senior Living ("Brookdale") percentages do not include $692 and $683 million, respectively, of
senior housing assets related to 21 senior housing facilities that Brookdale operates (beginning September 1, 2011) on the Company's behalf under a RIDEA structure. Assuming that these assets
were attributable to Brookdale, the percentage of combined segment and total assets attributable to Brookdale would be 20% and 8%, respectively, as of December 31, 2012, and 26% and 9%,
respectively, as of December 31, 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, Brookdale percentages do not include $143 million and $47 million, respectively, of
senior

revenues, related to 21 senior housing facilities that Brookdale operates on the Company's behalf under a RIDEA structure. Assuming that these revenues were attributable to Brookdale, the
percentage of combined segment and total revenues attributable to Brookdale would be 36% and 12%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 31% and 10%, respectively, for the year

properties formerly operated by Sunrise were transitioned to Emeritus effective November 1, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010,
Sunrise percentages exclude $33 million of revenues for 27 properties due to the consolidation of four VIEs from August 31 2010 to November 1, 2010. Assuming that these revenues
were attributable to Sunrise, the percentage of segment and total revenues for Sunrise would be 28% and 12%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Percentage of total revenues
from Emeritus for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes partial results for Blackstone JV acquisition. Assuming that full-year results were included for this acquisition in the
Company's 2012 revenues, the percentage of segment revenues and total revenues would be 36% and 12%, respectively.

(4)

Certain
of the Company's properties are leased to tenants who have entered into management contracts with Sunrise to operate the respective property on
their behalf. The Company's concentration of gross assets includes properties directly leased to Sunrise and properties that are managed by Sunrise on behalf of third party tenants.

On September 1, 2011, the Company completed a strategic venture with Brookdale that includes the operation of 37 HCP-owned
senior living communities previously leased to or operated by Horizon Bay Retirement Living ("Horizon Bay"). As part of this transaction, Brookdale acquired Horizon Bay and: (i) assumed an
existing triple-net lease for nine HCP communities; (ii) entered into a new triple-net lease related to four HCP communities; (iii) assumed Horizon Bay's
management of three HCP communities, one of which was recently developed by HCP; and (iv) entered into management contracts and a joint venture agreement for a 10% interest in the real estate
and operations for 21 of the Company's communities that are in a RIDEA structure. In connection with these transactions, the Company purchased approximately one million shares of Brookdale's common
stock in June 2011 (see Note 10 for additional information regarding these marketable equity securities).

Under
the provisions of RIDEA, a REIT may lease "qualified health care properties" on an arm's length basis to a TRS if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person
who qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor." The year ended December 31, 2012 includes $143 million and $91 million in revenues and operating expenses, respectively, as
a result of reflecting the facility-level results for the 21 RIDEA facilities operated by Brookdale beginning September 1, 2011. The year ended December 31, 2011 includes
$47 million and $30 million in revenues and operating expenses, respectively, as a result of reflecting the facility-level results for the 21 RIDEA facilities.

The
year ended December 31, 2010 includes increases of $29 million and $26 million in revenues and operating expenses, respectively, as a result of reflecting the
facility-level results for 27 facilities leased to four VIE tenants operated by Sunrise that were consolidated, for the period from August 31, 2010 to November 1, 2010, as a result of
the termination rights the Company acquired from the settlement agreement discussed above. See Note 21 for additional information regarding VIEs.

To
mitigate credit risk of leasing properties to certain senior housing and post-acute/skilled nursing operators, leases with operators are often combined into portfolios
that contain cross-default terms, so that if a tenant of any of the properties in a portfolio defaults on its obligations under its lease, the Company may pursue its remedies under the lease with
respect to any of the properties in the portfolio. Certain portfolios also contain terms whereby the net operating profits of the properties are combined for the purpose of securing the funding of
rental payments due under each lease.

At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company's gross real estate assets in the state of California, excluding assets held-for-sale, represented approximately
20% and 23% of the Company's total assets, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company's revenues derived from properties

F-37


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

located
in the states of California, Texas and Florida represented approximately 22%, 12% and 10% of the Company's total revenues, respectively.

DownREIT LLCs

In connection with the formation of certain DownREIT limited liability companies ("LLCs"), members may contribute appreciated real
estate to a DownREIT LLC in exchange for DownREIT units. These contributions are generally tax-deferred, so that the pre-contribution gain related to the property is not
taxed to the member. However, if a contributed property is later sold by the DownREIT LLC, the unamortized pre-contribution gain that exists at the date of sale is specifically
allocated and taxed to the contributing members. In many of the DownREITs, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with those members who contributed appreciated property into the
DownREIT LLC. Under these indemnification agreements, if any of the appreciated real estate contributed by the members is sold by the DownREIT LLC in a taxable transaction within a
specified number of years, the Company will reimburse the affected members for the federal and state income taxes associated with the pre-contribution gain that is specially allocated to
the affected member under the Code ("make-whole payments"). These make-whole payments include a tax gross-up provision. These indemnification agreements have
expiration terms that range through 2033.

Credit Enhancement Guarantee

Certain of the Company's senior housing facilities serve as collateral for $117 million of debt (maturing May 1, 2025)
that is owed by a previous owner of the facilities. This indebtedness is guaranteed by the previous owner who has an investment grade credit rating. These senior housing facilities, which are
classified as DFLs, had a carrying value of $374 million as of December 31, 2012.

Environmental Costs

The Company monitors its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
liability with respect to the properties that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company carries environmental insurance
and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limitations and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and current
industry practice.

General Uninsured Losses

The Company obtains various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property, business interruption, liability, flood, windstorm,
earthquake, environmental and terrorism related losses. The Company attempts to obtain appropriate policy terms, conditions, limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss, the cost of
such coverage and current industry practice. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not
economically insurable. In addition, the Company has a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake, flood and windstorm occurrences for which the related insurances carry high
deductibles.

Tenant Purchase Options

Certain leases contain purchase options whereby the tenant may elect to acquire the underlying real estate. Annualized lease payments

approximately $7 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively. These rental expense amounts include ground rent and other leases. Ground leases generally require fixed annual
rent payments and may also include escalation clauses and renewal options. These leases have terms that are up to 99 years, excluding extension options. Future minimum lease obligations under

(14) Segment Disclosures

The Company evaluates its business and makes resource allocations based on its five business segments: (i) senior housing,
(ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital. Under the senior housing, post-acute/skilled nursing,
life science and hospital segments, the Company invests or co-invests primarily in single operator or tenant properties, through the acquisition and development of real estate, management
of operations (RIDEA) and by debt issued by operators in these sectors. Under the medical office segment, the Company invests or co-invests through the acquisition and development of
medical office buildings ("MOBs") that are leased under gross, modified gross or triple-net leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property
management. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). There were no intersegment

or transfers during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company evaluates performance based upon property net operating income from continuing operations ("NOI"), adjusted NOI
and interest income of the combined investments in each segment.

Non-segment
assets consist primarily of corporate assets including cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, net, marketable equity securities, deferred financing costs
and, if any, real estate held-for-sale. Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to
individual segments in determining the Company's performance measure. See Note 12 for other information regarding concentrations of credit risk.

NOI
is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. The Company defines NOI as rental
and related revenues, including tenant recoveries, resident fees and services, and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes interest income, investment
management fee income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, litigation settlement, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, income taxes,
equity income from and impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and discontinued operations. The Company believes NOI provides relevant and useful information because it reflects
only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. Adjusted NOI is calculated as NOI after eliminating the effects of
straight-line rents, DFL accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. Adjusted NOI is sometimes referred to as "cash NOI." The Company
uses NOI and adjusted NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP
measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP because it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, the
Company's definition of NOI may not be comparable to the definition used by other REITs, as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.

Stock Based Compensation

On May 11, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the 2006 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2006 Incentive Plan"). The 2006
Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock and performance restricted stock units to officers, employees and directors in
connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. On April 23, 2009, the Company's stockholders amended the 2006 Incentive Plan. As a result of the amendment, the
maximum number of shares reserved for awards under the 2006 Incentive Plan, as amended, is 23.2 million shares. The maximum number of shares available for future awards under the

F-44


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Incentive Plan is 6.8 million shares at December 31, 2012, of which approximately 4.5 million shares may be issued as restricted stock and performance restricted stock units.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted with an exercise price per share equal to the closing market price of the company's common stock on the grant
date. Stock options generally vest ratably over a four- to five-year period and have a 10-year contractual term. Vesting of certain options may accelerate, as
provided in the 2006 Incentive Plan or in the applicable award agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other specified events. Upon the exercise of options, the participant is required to
pay the exercise price of the options being exercised and the related tax withholding obligation. Participants have the ability to elect to have the Company withhold the number of shares to be
delivered upon exercise of stock options to pay the related exercise price and tax withholding obligation. The value of the shares withheld is dependent upon the closing market price of the Company's
common stock on the date that the relevant transaction occurs.

The weighted average fair value per share at the date of grant for options awarded during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010
was $6.34, $5.97 and $5.17, respectively. The total vesting date intrinsic value (at vesting) of shares under options vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was
$18.0 million, $15.8 million and $10.7 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of vested shares under options at December 31, 2012 was $7.0 million.

Proceeds
received from options exercised under the 2006 Incentive Plan for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $51.6 million, $30.8 million and
$6.3 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (at exercise) of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $51.0 million,
$13.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

The
fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model
that uses the assumptions described below. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date. The expected life (estimated period of time
outstanding) of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees and turnover rates. For stock options granted in 2012, 2011 and 2010, the expected
volatility was based on the average of the Company's: (i) historical volatility of the adjusted closing prices of its common stock for a period equal to the stock option's expected life, ending
on the grant date, calculated on a weekly basis and (ii) the implied volatility of traded options on its common stock for a period equal to 30 days ending on the grant date. For stock
options granted prior to 2010, the expected volatility was based on the Company's historical volatility of the adjusted closing prices of its common stock for a period equal to the stock option's
expected life, ending on the grant date and calculated on a weekly basis. The following table summarizes the Company's stock option valuation assumptions used with respect to stock options awarded in

Restricted Stock and Performance Restricted Stock Units

Under the 2006 Incentive Plan, restricted stock and performance restricted stock units generally have a contractual life or vest over a
three- to five-year period. The vesting of certain restricted shares

F-46


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and
units may accelerate, as provided in the 2006 Incentive Plan or in the applicable award agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other specified events. When vested, each performance
restricted stock unit is convertible into one share of common stock. The restricted stock and performance restricted stock units are valued on the grant date based on the closing market price of the
Company's common stock on that date. Generally, the Company recognizes the fair value of the awards over the applicable vesting period as compensation expense. Upon any exercise or payment of
restricted shares or units, the participant is required to pay the related tax withholding obligation. Participants generally have the flexibility to elect to have the Company reduce the number of
shares to be delivered to pay the related tax withholding obligation. The value of the shares withheld is dependent on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date that the
relevant transaction occurs. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company withheld 361,000, 136,000 and 154,000 shares, respectively, to offset tax withholding obligations with respect to the restricted
stock and restricted stock unit awards.

At December 31, 2012, the weighted average remaining vesting period of restricted stock units and restricted stock was three years. The
total fair values (at vesting) of restricted stock and restricted stock units which vested for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $38.6 million, $14.4 million
and $12.5 million, respectively.

As
the Company pays dividends on its outstanding common stock, holders of restricted stock awards are generally entitled to any dividends on the underlying restricted shares, and holders
of restricted stock units generally have the right to a cash payment equal to the dividends that would be paid on a number of shares of Company common stock equal to the number of outstanding units
subject to the award.

On
August 14, 2006, the Company granted 219,000 restricted stock units to the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The restricted stock units vest over a period of
10 years beginning in 2012, subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances as provided in the applicable award agreement and the Company's employment agreement with its Chief Executive
Officer. Each vested unit will be convertible, upon payment of the award, into one share of common stock. Additionally, as the Company pays dividends on its outstanding common stock, the original
award will be credited with additional restricted stock units as dividend equivalents (in lieu of receiving a cash payment). Generally, the dividend equivalent restricted stock units will be subject
to the same vesting and other conditions as applied to the grant. At December 31, 2012, the total number of restricted stock units under this arrangement was approximately 317,000.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In
2012, the Company implemented a clawback policy that is retroactive to prior years pursuant to which its Board of Directors or Compensation Committee shall, in such circumstances as
it determines to be appropriate, require reimbursement or cancellation of all or a portion of any short or long-term cash or equity incentive awards or payments to an officer (or former
officer, as the case may be) of the Company where: (1) the amount of, or number of shares included in, any such payment or award was determined based on the achievement of financial results
that were subsequently the subject of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws; and (2) a lesser payment or award of
cash or shares would have been made to the individual based upon the restated financial results; and (3) the payment or award of cash or shares was received by the individual prior to or during
the
12-month period following the first public issuance or filing of the financial results that were subsequently restated.

Total
share-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $23.3 million, $20.2 million and $15.1 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2012, there was $41.6 million of deferred compensation cost associated with future employee services, related to unvested share-based compensation
arrangements granted under the Company's incentive plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years.

Employee Benefit Plan

The Company maintains a 401(k) and profit sharing plan that allows for eligible participants to defer compensation, subject to certain
limitations imposed by the Code. The Company provides a matching contribution of up to 4% of each participant's eligible compensation. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company's matching contributions
were approximately $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

(17) Impairments

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company executed an expansion of its tenant relationship with General Atomics in Poway, CA, to a total of
396,000 square feet, consisting of the following: (i) a lease extension of 281,000 square feet through June 2024, (ii) a new 10—year lease for a 115,000 square feet building
to be developed and (iii) the purchase of a 19 acre land parcel from the Company for $19 million. As a result of the land sale the Company recognized an impairment charge of
$7.9 million, which reduced the carrying value of the Company's investment from $27 million to the $19 million sales price. The fair value of the Company's land parcel was based
on the sales price from its disposition in conjunction with this transaction. The sales price of the land parcel was considered to be a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company concluded that its senior secured term loan to Delphis was impaired and established a provision for losses (impairment) of
$15.4 million. The impairment resulted from the Company's conclusion that the carrying value of its loan was in excess of the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral assets. This
provision for losses reduced the carrying value of its investment from $91.1 million to its fair value of $75.7 million. The fair value of the Company's loan investment was based on a
discounted cash flow valuation model and inputs considered to be a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Inputs to this valuation model include real estate capitalization rates,
discount rates, earnings multiples, industry growth rates and operating margins, some of which influence the Company's expectation of future cash flows from the loan and, accordingly, the fair value
of its investment.

F-48


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On
October 12, 2010, the Company concluded that its 35% interest in HCP Ventures II, which owns 25 senior housing properties leased by Horizon Bay Communities or certain of
its affiliates (collectively "Horizon Bay"), was impaired. The impairment resulted from the recent and projected deterioration of the operating performance of the properties leased by Horizon Bay from
HCP Ventures II. During the year ended December 31, 2010 the Company recognized an impairment of $71.7 million related to its investment in HCP Ventures II, which reduced
the carrying value of its investment from $136.8 million to its fair value of $65.1 million. The fair value of the Company's investment in HCP Ventures II was based on a
discounted cash flow valuation model that is considered to be a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Inputs to this valuation model include real estate capitalization rates,
discount rates, industry growth rates and operating margins, some of which influence the Company's expectation of future cash flows from HCP Ventures II and, accordingly, the fair value of its
investment.

(18) Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $1.6 million, as compared to income tax expense of
$1.2 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company's income tax expense from discontinued operations was insignificant for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The Company's deferred income tax expense and its balance in deferred tax assets and liabilities were insignificant as of December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010.

The
Company files numerous U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax returns. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local tax
examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 2008.

At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the tax basis of the Company's net assets is less than the reported amounts by $7.6 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively. The
difference between the reported amounts and the tax basis is primarily related to the Slough Estates USA, Inc. ("SEUSA") and HCR ManorCare acquisitions, which occurred in 2007 and 2011,
respectively. Both SEUSA and HCR ManorCare were corporations subject to federal and state income taxes. As a result of these acquisitions, the Company succeeded to the tax attributes of SEUSA and HCR
ManorCare, including the tax basis in the acquired companies' assets and liabilities. The Company generally will be subject to a corporate-level tax on any taxable disposition of SEUSA's
pre-acquisition assets that occur within ten years after its August 1, 2007 acquisition, and any taxable disposition of HCR ManorCare's pre-acquisition assets that occur
within ten years after its April 7, 2011 acquisition.

The
corporate-level tax associated with the disposition of assets acquired in connection with the SEUSA and HCR ManorCare acquisitions would be assessed only to the extent of the
built-in gain that existed on the date of each acquisition, based on the fair market value of the assets on August 1, 2007, with respect to SEUSA, and April 7, 2011, with
respect to HCR ManorCare. The Company does not expect to dispose of any assets included in either acquisition that would result in the imposition of a material tax liability. As a result, the Company
has not recorded a deferred tax liability associated with this corporate-level tax. Gains from asset dispositions occurring more than 10 years after either acquisition will not be subject to
this corporate-level tax. However, from time to time, the Company may dispose of SEUSA or HCR ManorCare assets before the applicable 10-year periods if it is able to effect a tax deferred
exchange.

In
connection with the SEUSA and HCR ManorCare acquisitions, the Company assumed unrecognized tax benefits of $8 million and $2 million, respectively. During 2011, the
Company had a

F-49


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

net
decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $4.9 million. The decrease was caused by the reversal of the remaining $6.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits related to the SEUSA
acquisition caused by SEUSA's settlement of federal and state tax audits for all years for which unrecognized tax benefits had been accrued, net of a $2.0 million increase in unrecognized tax
benefits assumed in connection with the HCR ManorCare acquisition. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the entire $2.0 million balance in unrecognized tax benefits was related to HCP's
acquisition of HCR ManorCare.

The Company anticipates that the balance in unrecognized tax benefits will decrease over the next 12 months by approximately $891,000 due
to a lapse in the statute of limitations.

For
the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded an insignificant increase to interest expense associated with the unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the reversal of the
remaining balance of the SEUSA unrecognized tax benefits during 2011, the related $1.3 million of interest expense was also reversed. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
the Company recorded net reductions to interest expense of $1.1 million and net increases to interest expense of $0.2 million, respectively, associated with the unrecognized tax
benefits.

The
Company has agreements with the sellers of SEUSA and HCR ManorCare whereby any increases in taxes and associated interest and penalties related to years prior to each of these
acquisitions will be the responsibility of the sellers. Similarly, any pre-acquisition tax refunds and associated interest income will be refunded to the sellers.

There
would be no effect on the Company's tax rate if the unrecognized tax benefits were to be recognized.

(21) Variable Interest Entities

Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

At December 31, 2012, the Company leased 48 properties to a total of seven VIE tenants and had an additional investment in a
loan to a VIE borrower. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. The carrying value and classification of the related assets, liabilities and maximum exposure
to loss as a result of the Company's involvement with these VIEs are presented below at December 31, 2012 (in thousands):

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

As of December 31, 2012, the Company has not provided, and is not required to provide, financial support through a liquidity arrangement or
otherwise, to its unconsolidated VIEs, including circumstances in which it could be exposed to further losses (e.g., cash shortfalls).

The
Company holds an interest-only, senior secured term loan made to a borrower (Delphis Operations, L.P.) that has been identified as a VIE (see Note 7 for
additional information on the Delphis loan). The Company does not consolidate the VIE because it does not have the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance. The loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the borrower (comprised primarily of interests in partnerships that operate surgical facilities, some of which are on the premises of
properties owned by the Company or HCP Ventures IV, LLC) and is supported in part by limited guarantees made by certain former and current principals of the borrower. Recourse under
certain of these guarantees is limited to the guarantors' respective ownership interests in certain entities owning real estate that are pledged to secure such guarantees.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

In September 2011, the Company formed a partnership in which it has a 90% ownership interest and a leasing relationship with an entity
that operates 21 properties in a RIDEA structure ("RIDEA Entity"). The Company consolidated this entity as a result of the rights it acquired through the joint venture agreement with Brookdale (see
Note 12 for additional information on the RIDEA structure). In the fourth quarter of 2012, upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event, it was determined that this RIDEA Entity is a VIE and
that the Company is the primary beneficiary; therefore, the Company continues to consolidate this entity. The assets and liabilities of this RIDEA Entity substantially consist of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated from its operating activities. The assets generated by the operating activities of the RIDEA Entity may be
used to settle its contractual obligations, which include lease obligations to the Company. The Company is entitled to its ownership share of the RIDEA Entity's assets; however, it does not guarantee
its liabilities (or contractual obligations) and is not liable to its general creditors.

During
2010, the Company had leasing relationships with a total of four VIE tenants, related to 27 properties, whose operations were not consolidated by the Company prior to
August 31, 2010 because it did not have the ability to control the activities (i.e., recurring operating activities) that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. On
August 31, 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Sunrise, whereby it determined that it had acquired the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact
the VIEs' economic performance. As a result, the Company consolidated the four VIEs for the period from August 31, 2010 (the date of the settlement agreement with Sunrise) to November 1,
2010 (the date these 27 properties were transitioned and leased to Emeritus). See Note 12 for additional information regarding the VIE tenants.

See
Notes 7 and 12 for additional description of the nature, purpose and activities of the Company's VIEs and interests therein.

(22) Fair Value Measurements

The following table illustrates the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets.
Recognized gains and losses are recorded in other income, net on the Company's consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2012, there were no transfers of financial
assets or liabilities between levels within the fair value hierarchy.

(23) Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair
value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair values of loans receivable, bank line of credit, term loan, mortgage debt and other debt are based on rates
currently prevailing for similar instruments with similar maturities. The fair values of the marketable debt securities, interest-rate and currency swap contracts as well as common stock
warrants were determined based on observable and unobservable market assumptions using standardized pricing models. The fair values of the senior unsecured notes and marketable equity securities are
determined utilizing market quotes.

Currency
swap contract (buy USD/sell GBP) hedges the foreign currency exchange risk related to a portion of the Company's forecasted interest receipts on
GBP denominated senior unsecured notes. Represents seven foreign exchange contracts to sell £7.2 million at a rate of $1.5695 on various dates between June 2013 and
June 2016.

The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations on specific forecasted
transactions as well as recognized financial obligations or assets. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

The
primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market and credit risk. Market risk is defined as the potential for loss in value of a derivative instrument due to adverse
changes in market prices. Utilizing derivative instruments allows the Company to manage the risk of fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates related to the potential impact these changes
could have on future earnings, forecasted cash flows and the fair value of recognized obligations.

Credit
risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation. The Company does not obtain collateral associated with its
derivative contracts, but monitors the credit standing of its counterparties on a regular basis. Should a counterparty fail to perform, the Company would incur a financial loss to the extent that the
associated derivative contract was in an asset position. At December 31, 2012, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties to its outstanding derivative
contracts.

During
October and November 2007, the Company entered into two forward- starting interest-rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $900 million and
settled the contracts during the three months ended June 30, 2008. The settlement value, less the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships, was recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income to be reclassified into interest expense over the forecasted term of the underlying unsecured fixed-rate debt. The interest-rate swap contracts were
designated in qualifying, cash flow hedging relationships, to hedge the Company's

F-55


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

exposure
to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate component of interest payments on forecasted, unsecured, fixed-rate debt that were expected to be issued in 2012 and 2013. During
2010, the Company revised its estimated issuance date for the underlying unsecured, fixed-rate debt. As a result, the Company recognized a $1.0 million charge in other income, net,
during the year ended December 31, 2010, related to the interest payments that were no longer probable of occurring.

In
August 2009, the Company entered into an interest-rate swap contract (pay float and receive fixed), that was designated as hedging fluctuations in interest receipts
related to its participation in the variable-rate first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare. At March 31, 2011 the
Company determined, based on the anticipated closing of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition during April 2011, that the underlying hedged transactions (underlying mortgage debt interest receipts) were not
probable of occurring. As a result, the Company reclassified $1 million of unrealized gains related to this interest-rate swap contract into other income, net. Concurrent with
closing the HCR ManorCare Acquisition (for additional details see Note 3), the Company settled the interest-rate swap contract for proceeds of $1 million.

On
July 27, 2012, the Company entered into a foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts
from its GBP denominated senior unsecured notes (see additional discussion of the Four Seasons Health Care Senior Unsecured Notes in Note 10). The cash flow hedge has a fixed USD/GBP exchange
rate of 1.5695 (buy $11.4 million and sell £7.2 million semi-annually) for a portion of its forecasted semi-annual cash receipts denominated in GBP.
The foreign currency swap contracts mature through June 2016 (the end of the non-call period of the senior unsecured notes). The fair value of the contracts at December 31, 2012 was
a liability of $2.6 million and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2012, there was no ineffective portion related to this hedge.

On
July 27, 2012, the Company entered into an interest-rate swap contract that is designated as hedging the interest payments on its GBP denominated Term Loan due to
fluctuations in the underlying benchmark interest rate (see additional discussions of the Term Loan in Note 11). The cash flow hedge has a notional amount of £137 million and
expires in June 2016 (the maturity of the Term Loan). The fair value of the contract at December 31, 2012 was an asset of $89,000 and is included in other assets, net. During the year ended
December 31, 2012, there was no ineffective portion related to this hedge.

For
the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company earned lower interest income of $209,000 and recognized additional interest expense of $3.3 million, resulting from its
cash flow and fair value hedging relationships. At December 31, 2012, the Company expects that the hedged forecasted transactions for each of the outstanding qualifying cash flow hedging
relationships remain probable of occurring and as a result no gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified to earnings.

To
illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets, the Company performed a market sensitivity analysis on its outstanding hedging instruments. The
Company applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange

(25) Transactions with Related Parties

Mr. Klaritch, an executive vice president of the Company, was previously a senior executive and limited liability company member of MedCap
Properties, LLC, which was acquired in October 2003 by HCP and a joint venture of which HCP was the managing member. As part of that transaction, MedCap Properties, LLC contributed
certain property interests to a newly-formed entity, HCPI/Tennessee LLC, in exchange for DownREIT units. In connection with the transactions, Mr. Klaritch received 113,431
non-managing member units in HCPI/Tennessee, LLC in a distribution of his interest in MedCap Properties, LLC. Each DownREIT unit is redeemable for an amount of cash
approximating the then-current market value of two shares of HCP's common stock or, at HCP's option, two shares of HCP's common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits,
stock dividends and reclassifications). During the year ended December 31, 2012, Mr. Klaritch and his affiliates exchanged their remaining approximately 45,000 HCPI/Tennessee, LLC
DownREIT units for approximately 90,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
