PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

Health Care Property Investors, Inc. (HCPI), a Maryland
corporation, was organized in March 1985 to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT). We invest in health care related real estate located throughout the United States, including long-term care facilities, acute care and rehabilitation
hospitals, medical office buildings, assisted living facilities, retirement living communities, health care laboratory and biotech research facilities, physician group practice clinics and health and wellness centers. We commenced business nearly 18
years ago, making us the second oldest REIT specializing in health care real estate.

As of December 31, 2002, our gross investment in our properties, including partnership interests and mortgage loans, was approximately $3.1 billion. Our portfolio of 463 owned properties in 43 states
consisted of:

•

184 long-term care facilities

•

101 assisted living facilities

•

85 medical office buildings

•

35 physician group practice clinics

•

22 acute care hospitals

•

14 retirement living communities

•

Nine rehabilitation hospitals

•

Eight health care laboratory and biotech research facilities

•

Five health and wellness centers

The average age of our properties is 17 years. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 58% of our annualized revenue was derived from
properties operated by publicly traded health care providers.

Our senior debt is rated BBB+ by both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch and Baa2 by Moody’s and has been rated medium investment grade continuously since 1986, when we first received a bond rating. Our average annual return
to stockholders, assuming reinvestment of dividends and before stockholders’ income taxes, was approximately 17.2% over the period from our initial public offering in May 1985 through December 31, 2002.

References herein to “HCPI”, “the
Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” include Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures and partnerships, unless the context otherwise requires.

For purposes of this report, “annualized revenue” is
intended to be an estimate of our revenue for the 12 months ending December 31, 2003 for assets owned on December 31, 2002 and is calculated as follows:

(a)

base rents, interest or, in the case of our managed properties, net operating income, to be accrued by us during 2003 under existing contracts; plus

(b)

additional rents accrued by us during the 12 months ended December 31, 2002, which were approximately $25 million in the aggregate; plus or minus


(c)

adjustments for: completed asset dispositions; known or expected changes in rent due to contract expirations or rent resets during 2003; and known or expected rent
reductions.

We calculate the net operating income
of our managed properties by subtracting from contractual rent the anticipated expenses not covered by the tenant under the gross leases underlying such properties. See “Leases and Loans” below.

You can access free of charge a copy of the periodic and
current reports we file with the SEC on our website at www.hcpi.com. Our periodic and current reports are made available on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with the SEC.

Our Properties

Portfolio

As of December 31, 2002, of the 463 properties in our portfolio, we had an ownership interest in 419
properties located in 41 states. We leased 317 of these properties pursuant to long-term triple net leases to 89 health care providers. Under a triple net lease, in addition to the rent obligation, the lessee is responsible for all operating
expenses of the property such as utilities, property taxes, insurance and repairs and maintenance. The most significant lessees under triple net leases include the following companies or their affiliates:

•

Tenet Healthcare Corporation (Tenet)

•

American Retirement Corporation (ARC)

•

Emeritus Corporation (Emeritus)

•

HealthSouth Corporation (HealthSouth)

•

Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (Kindred)

•

HCA Inc. (HCA)

•

Beverly Enterprises, Inc. (Beverly)

The remaining 102 owned properties are medical office buildings, physician clinics, health care laboratory and biotech research facilities
and surgery centers with triple net, gross or modified gross leases with multiple tenants which are managed by independent property management companies on our behalf. Under gross or modified gross leases, we may be responsible for property taxes,
repairs and maintenance and/or insurance on those properties.

We also hold loans on 44 properties that are owned and operated by 14 health care providers including ARC, Beverly and Emeritus. We have provided secured loans in the amount of $276,648,000 on these properties, including 16 long-term
care facilities, 16 assisted living facilities, three acute care hospitals and nine retirement living communities. At December 31, 2002, the remaining balance on these secured loans totaled $275,905,000.

Tenet, ARC and Emeritus account for 16.3%, 7.1% and 5.4% of
our annualized revenue, respectively. No other single lessee or operator accounts for more than 5.0% of our annualized revenue as of the year ended December 31, 2002.


Equity Investments

Of the 419 health care facilities in which
we had an ownership interest as of December 31, 2002, we own 100% of 344 facilities, including:

•

144 long-term care facilities

•

81 assisted living facilities

•

59 medical office buildings

•

35 physician group practice clinics

•

17 acute care hospitals

•

five retirement living communities

•

three rehabilitation hospitals

At December 31, 2002, we also had interests in several limited liability companies and partnerships that together own 84 facilities and
one mortgage as further discussed below under “Investments in Consolidated and Non-Consolidated Joint Ventures.”

The following is a summary of our properties grouped by type of facility and equity interest as of December 31, 2002:


(1)

“Annualized revenue” is calculated as follows:

(a)

base rents, interest or, in the case of our managed properties, net operating income, to be accrued by us during 2003 under existing contracts; plus

(b)

additional rents accrued by us during the 12 months ended December 31, 2002, which were approximately $25 million in the aggregate; plus or minus

(c)

adjustments for: completed asset dispositions; known or expected changes in rent due to contract expirations or rent resets during 2003; and known or expected rent
reductions.

We calculate the net operating income of our managed properties by subtracting from contractual
rent the anticipated expenses not covered by the tenant under the gross leases underlying such properties. See “Leases and Loans” below.

(2)

Includes $8,540 of anticipated annualized revenue on leases of the Centennial and Sun properties discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

(3)

Assisted living facilities are apartment-like facilities and are therefore stated in units (studio, one or two bedroom apartments) in order to indicate facility
size. Medical office buildings (including health and wellness centers), physician group practice clinics and health care laboratory and biotech research facilities are measured in square feet and encompass approximately 5,081,000 square feet,
986,000 square feet and 510,000 square feet, respectively. Long-term care facilities, acute care hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals are measured by licensed bed count.

(4)

Includes partnership and limited liability company investments, and incorporates all partners’ and members’ assets and construction funded as well as our
investment in unconsolidated joint ventures.

(5)

Includes a $125 million investment in nine facilities owned by ARC comprised of a $113 million loan and a 9.8% ownership interest in seven limited liability
companies, which own a total of nine retirement living communities. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our investment with ARC.

Property Types

The following paragraphs describe each type of property.

Long-Term Care Facilities

. We have invested in 184 long-term care facilities. Various health care
providers operate these facilities. Long-term care facilities offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at acute care hospitals. Ancillary revenues
and revenue from subacute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and IV therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic
therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain long-term care facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an out-patient basis. Long-term care facilities are designed to supplement hospital care and many
have transfer agreements with one or more acute care hospitals. These facilities depend to some degree upon referrals from practicing physicians and hospitals. Long-term care services are paid for either by private sources, or through the federal
Medicare and state Medicaid programs.

Long-term
care facilities generally provide patients with accommodation, complete medical and nursing care, and rehabilitation services including speech, physical and occupational therapy. As a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981,
Congress established a waiver program under Medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional long-term care services. The provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990 allow states, with federal approval, greater flexibility in
program design as a means of developing cost-effective alternatives to delivering services traditionally provided in the long-term care setting. This was a contributing factor to the past increase in the number of assisted living facilities, which
adversely affected some long-term care


facilities as some individuals chose the residential environment and lower cost delivery system provided
in the assisted living setting.

Acute Care
Hospitals

. We have an interest in 19 general acute care hospitals and three long-term acute care hospitals. Acute care hospitals offer a wide range of services such as fully-equipped operating and recovery rooms, obstetrics, radiology, intensive
care, open heart surgery and coronary care, neurosurgery, neonatal intensive care, magnetic resonance imaging, nursing units, oncology, clinical laboratories, respiratory therapy, physical therapy, nuclear medicine, rehabilitation services and
outpatient services.

Long-term acute care
hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring, or emergency back-up than that available in most skilled nursing-based subacute programs. Most long-term acute care hospital patients
have severe chronic health problems and are medically unstable or at risk of medical instability. The most common cases treated in this setting include high acuity ventilator-dependent patients and patients with multiple system failures relating to
cancer, spinal cord injuries or head injuries.

Services are paid for by private sources, third party payors (e.g., insurance and HMOs), or through the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare provides reimbursement incentives to traditional general acute care
hospitals to minimize inpatient length of stay.

Medical Office Buildings

. We have investments in 90 medical office buildings, including five health and wellness centers. Many of these buildings are located adjacent to, or on the campus of, acute care hospitals. Medical
office buildings contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and day-surgery operating rooms. Health and wellness centers provide testing and preventative health
maintenance services. Medical office buildings require more extensive plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling capabilities than commercial office buildings for sinks, brighter lights, special equipment and biological waste mechanisms required for
the proper operation of a medical office. Of our owned medical office buildings and health and wellness centers, 23 are master leased on a triple net basis while 67 are managed by third party property management companies and are leased under triple
net, gross or modified gross leases under which we are responsible for certain operating expenses.

Assisted Living Facilities

. We have investments in 101 assisted living facilities offering studio, one bedroom and two bedroom
apartments on a month-to-month basis primarily to individuals who are over 75 years of age with various levels of assistance requirements. More ambulatory residents are provided meals and eat in a central dining area; they may also be assisted with
some daily living activities with programs and services that allow residents certain conveniences and make it possible for them to live independently; staff is also available when residents need assistance and for group activities. Services provided
to residents who require more assistance with daily living activities, but who do not require the constant supervision other long-term care facilities provide include personal supervision and assistance with eating, bathing, grooming and
administering medication. Charges for room and board are generally paid from private sources.

Retirement Living Communities

. We have investments in 14 retirement living communities. These communities are large, upscale residential communities in a congregate care and continuing care
living setting combined with onsite amenities and services. Residents are provided the comfort, security and convenience of residing within an aging in place environment, eliminating the need to seek


further resident appropriate levels of care. Ancillary and health care services are available at those
properties that provide nursing and assisted living care. The full continuum of senior living environment includes independent living apartments and cottages, assisted living and, in some communities, skilled nursing and Alzheimer’s care.
Various accommodation terms are available to residents, including monthly rentals, rental life care, fully refundable entrance fees, non-refundable endowments, cooperatives, and condominiums.

Rehabilitation Hospitals

. We have investments in nine
rehabilitation hospitals. These hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses, such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, head injuries, orthopedic problems, work related disabilities and
neurological diseases, as well as treatment for amputees and patients with severe arthritis. Rehabilitation programs encompass physical, occupational, speech and inhalation therapies, rehabilitative nursing and other specialties. Services are paid
for by the patient or the patient’s family, third party payors (e.g., insurance and HMOs), or through the federal Medicare program.

Physician Group Practice Clinics

. We have investments in 35 physician group practice clinic facilities that are leased to 13
different tenants. These clinics generally provide a broad range of medical services through organized physician groups representing various medical specialties. Each clinic facility is generally leased to a single lessee under a triple net or
modified gross lease.

Health Care Laboratory
and Biotech Research Facilities

. We have investments in eight health care laboratory and biotech research facilities. These facilities are located on a research campus of a major university. The facilities are designed for and accommodate
research and development in the biopharmaceutical industry, drug discovery and development, and predictive and personalized medicine. The facilities are leased to two tenants on a long-term basis.

The following table shows, with respect to each property type,
the location by state, the number of beds/units, recent occupancy levels, patient revenue mix, Annualized Revenue and information regarding remaining lease terms.




(1)

“Annualized revenue” is calculated as follows:

(a)

base rents, interest or, in the case of our managed properties, net operating income, to be accrued by us during 2003 under existing contracts; plus

(b)

additional rents accrued by us during the 12 months ended December 31, 2002, which were approximately $25 million in the aggregate; plus or minus

(c)

adjustments for: completed asset dispositions; known or expected changes in rent due to contract expirations or rent resets during 2003; and known or expected rent
reductions.

We calculate the net operating income of our managed properties by subtracting from contractual
rent the anticipated expenses not covered by the tenant under the gross leases underlying such properties. See “Leases and Loans” below.

(2)

Includes $8,540 of anticipated annualized revenue in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin on leases with
the Centennial and Sun properties discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

(3)

Assisted living facilities are apartment-like facilities and are therefore stated in units (studio, one or two bedroom apartments) in order to indicate facility
size. Medical office buildings (including wellness centers), physician group practice clinics and health care laboratory and biotech research facilities are measured in square feet and encompass approximately 5,081,000 square feet, 986,000 square
feet and 510,000 square feet, respectively. Long-term care facilities, acute care hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals are measured by licensed bed count.

(4)

This information is derived from information provided by our lessees for the most recently provided quarter through September 30, 2002. Excluded are facilities under
construction, newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities, and facilities where the data is not available or not meaningful. Occupancy computations are weighted by number of beds/units. Long-Term Care Facilities are computed using
available beds which can sometimes be less than the number of licensed beds a facility may have. All occupancy percentages represent performance by our lessees’ health care operations and occupancy for medical office buildings, physician group
practice clinics and health care laboratory and biotech research facilities do not apply as many of these facilities are master-leased.

(5)

This information is derived from information provided by our lessees for the most recently provided quarter through September 30, 2002. Excluded are facilities under
construction, newly completed facilities under start up, vacant facilities and facilities where the data is not available or not meaningful. The high quality revenue mix is the percentage of revenues not originating from Medicaid revenues.

(6)

Average Remaining Lease Term calculations are weighted by annualized revenue.

(7)

Includes five health and wellness centers.

(8)

Since December 31, 2001, four properties were recharacterized. Two campuses in South Carolina, previously classified as five assisted living facilities and two
long-term care facilities, have been combined into two retirement living communities. In addition, one assisted living facility was reclassified and combined with an already existing long-term care facility.

Competition

We compete for real estate acquisitions and financings with
health care providers, other health care related real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships, real estate lenders, and other investors.

Our properties are subject to competition from the properties of other health care providers. Certain of these other operators have
capital resources substantially in excess of some of the operators of our facilities. In addition, the extent to which the properties are utilized depends upon several factors, including the number of physicians using the health care facilities or
referring patients there, competitive systems of health care delivery and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a
significant influence on the utilization of the properties. Virtually all of the properties operate in a competitive environment and patients and referral sources, including physicians, may change their preferences for a health care facility from
time to time.


Facility
Operators

At December 31,
2002, we had investments in 463 properties located in 43 states and operated by 96 health care operators. In addition, approximately 650 leases are in force in the multi-tenant buildings. Listed below are our major operators, the number of
facilities operated by those operators, and the annualized revenue and the approximate percentage of annualized revenue derived from those operators.

(1)

“Annualized revenue” is calculated as follows:

(a)

base rents, interest or, in the case of our managed properties, net operating income, to be accrued by the Company during 2003 under existing contracts; plus

(b)

additional rents accrued by the Company during the 12 months ended December 31, 2002, which were approximately $25 million in the aggregate; plus or minus

(c)

adjustments for: completed or planned asset dispositions; known or expected changes in rent due to contract expirations or rent resets during 2003; and known or
expected rent reductions by tenants.

We calculate the net operating income of our managed properties by
subtracting from contractual rent the anticipated expenses not covered by the tenant under the gross leases underlying such properties. See “Leases and Loans” below.

Tenet, ARC, Emeritus, HealthSouth, Kindred, HCA and Beverly are subject to the informational filing
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and accordingly file periodic financial statements on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We obtained all of the financial and other information
relating to these operators listed below from their public reports.


The following
table summarizes our major public operators’ assets, stockholders’ equity, interim revenue and net income (or net loss) from continuing operations as of or for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.

(1)

The information described above for Tenet is for the six months ended November 30, 2002 or as of

November 30, 2002, as applicable.

The following table summarizes our major public operators’ assets, stockholders’ equity, revenue and net income (or net loss)
from continuing operations as of or for the year ended December 31, 2001.

(1)

The information described above for Tenet is for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2002 or as of May 31, 2002, as applicable.

(2)

The information described above for Kindred is for the nine months ended December 31, 2001 or as of December 31, 2001, as applicable. Kindred, formerly Vencor,
Inc., was formed in April 2001 upon emerging from bankruptcy.

The current equity market capitalization for each of the operators listed above, based on the closing price of their common stock on February 7, 2003 as reported in the

Wall Street Journal

, and
based on the number of outstanding shares of their common stock as reported in their most recent public filing available is as follows: Tenet, $8.5 billion; HealthSouth, $1.4 billion; Kindred, $280 million; HCA, $20.7 billion; Emeritus, $42.4
million; ARC, $37.4 million; and Beverly, $176.2 million.


Long-Term Care and Assisted
Living Operators

Long-Term Care

Approximately 25% of our annualized revenue is currently
derived from the long-term care sector. Reduced reimbursements, a nursing shortage and increased liability insurance costs continue to plague the industry. Certain temporary Medicare add-on payments enacted in The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of
1999 and the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefit and Protection Act of 2000 expired in October 2002. As a result, Medicare reimbursement to nursing homes declined about 9%, as of October 1, 2002. Other add on payments associated with certain
classifications are scheduled to expire October 1, 2003, but there is currently a proposal to defer these cuts until 2005. A planned limitation on patient Medicare rehabilitation therapy procedures scheduled for January 1, 2003 has been delayed
until July 2003. It is anticipated that Medicare reimbursement will be further reduced by the therapy cap. The Medicare reimbursement decrease effective October 1, 2002, (but not including future possible reductions) is expected to cause the cash
flow coverage of rents (after management fees) of our long-term care facilities on a pro forma basis in the aggregate to decline from 1.4 to 1.2.

Due to economic challenges facing many states, nursing homes will likely continue to be under funded. Some states, such as California,
have proposed to reduce Medicaid reimbursement to nursing home providers. Management believes that inadequate Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and other issues discussed above will cause losses and reduced financial performance for many
long-term care facilities and operators.

We
cannot assure you that the troubled operations and bankruptcies of certain long-term care operators will not have a material adverse effect on our net income, Funds From Operations (FFO) or the market value of our common stock.

Assisted Living Operators

We currently derive approximately 14% of our annualized
revenue from the assisted living industry. This sector has been challenged by overbuilding, slow fill-up, rising insurance costs and higher operating costs associated with increased acuity of residents. Occupancy rates and bottom line performance,
including cash flow coverage on rents, are improving. Various operators have continued to expand their portfolios through acquisitions of existing assisted living facilities during this past year and facility new construction continues to remain
relatively low, indicating a positive signal for the industry. More operators are reporting positive operating cash flows for their portfolios while others are approaching this milestone.

While improvements are noted for the industry and specific operators, we cannot assure you that the trouble
experienced by assisted living operators will not have a material adverse effect on our net income, Funds From Operations (FFO) or the market value of our common stock.

Leases and Loans

The initial base rental rates of the triple net leases of properties we acquired during the three years ended December 31, 2002 have
generally ranged from 10% to 13% per annum of the acquisition price of the related property. Initial interest rates on the loans we entered into during the three years ended December 31, 2002 have generally ranged from 8% to 14% per annum. Rental
rates vary by lease, taking into consideration many factors, such as:


•

Creditworthiness of the lessee

•

Operating performance of the facility

•

Interest rates at the beginning of the lease

•

Location, type and physical condition of the facility

Certain leases provide for additional rents that are based upon a percentage of increased revenue over specific base period revenue of the
leased properties. Others have rent increases based on inflation indices or other factors and some leases and loans have annual fixed rent or interest rate increases (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the minimum and additional rents, each lessee
under a triple net lease is responsible for all additional charges, including charges related to non-payment or late payment of rent, taxes and assessments, governmental charges, and utility and other charges. Each triple net lessee is required, at
its expense, to maintain its leased property in good order and repair. We are not required to repair, rebuild or maintain the properties leased under triple net leases.

Each lessee with a gross or modified gross lease is also responsible for minimum and additional rents, but
may not be responsible for all operating expenses. Under gross or modified gross leases, we may be responsible for property taxes, repairs and maintenance and/or insurance on those properties.

The primary or fixed terms of the triple net and modified
gross leases generally range from ten to 15 years, and generally have one or more five-year (or longer) renewal options. The weighted average remaining base lease-term on the triple net and modified gross leases is approximately seven years. The
primary term of the gross leases to multiple tenants in the medical office buildings range from one to 20 years, with a weighted average of six years remaining on those leases. Obligations under the triple-net leases, in most cases, have corporate
parent or shareholder guarantees. Irrevocable letters of credit from various financial institutions and lease deposits back 141 leases and mortgage loans on 15 facilities which generally cover from one to 12 months of lease or loan payments. We
require the lessees and mortgagors to renew such letters of credit during the lease or loan term in amounts that may change based upon the passage of time, improved operating cash flows or improved credit ratings.

Based upon information provided to us by lessees or
mortgagors, certain facilities are presently underperforming financially. Individual facilities may underperform as a result of inadequate Medicaid reimbursement, low occupancy, less than optimal patient mix, excessive operating costs, other
operational issues or capital needs.

Each
lessee, at its expense, may make non-capital additions, modifications or improvements to its leased property. All such alterations, replacements and improvements must comply with the terms and provisions of the lease, and become our property upon
termination of the lease. Leases generally require the lessee to maintain adequate insurance on the leased property, naming us and any


mortgagees as additional insureds. In certain circumstances, the lessee may self-insure pursuant to a
prudent program of self-insurance if the lessee or the guarantor of its lease obligations has substantial net worth. In addition, each lease requires the lessee to indemnify us or our affiliates against certain liabilities in connection with the
leased property.

Development of Facilities

Since 1987, we have committed to the development of 64
facilities. As of December 31, 2002, we have funded costs of approximately $447 million and have completed 61 facilities of our total development commitment. The completed facilities comprise:

•

35 Assisted living facilities

•

Seven long-term care facilities

•

Eight medical office buildings

•

Five rehabilitation hospitals

•

Five acute care hospitals

•

One health care laboratory and biotech research facility

Simultaneously with the commencement of each of these development programs and prior to funding, we enter into a lease agreement with the
developer/operator. The base rent under the lease is generally established at a rate equivalent to a specified margin over our cost of money at the commencement of the lease.

Our build to suit development program generally includes a variety of additional forms of credit enhancement
and collateral beyond those provided by the leases. During the development period, we generally require additional security and collateral in the form of more than one of the following:

•

Irrevocable letters of credit from financial institutions;

•

Payment and performance bonds; and

•

Completion guarantees by either one or a combination of the developer/operator’s parent entity, other affiliates or one or more of the individual principals
who control the developer/operator.

In addition, before we advance any funds under the development agreement, the developer/operator must provide:

•

Satisfactory evidence in the form of an endorsement to our title insurance policy that no intervening liens have been placed on the property since the date of our
previous advance;

•

A certificate executed by the project architect that indicates that all construction work completed on the project conforms with the requirements of the applicable
plans and specifications;

•

A certificate executed by the general contractor that all work requested for reimbursement has been completed; and

•

Satisfactory evidence that the funds remaining unadvanced are sufficient for the payment of all costs necessary for the completion of the project in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the agreement.


As a further
safeguard during the development period, we generally will retain 10% of construction funds incurred until we have received satisfactory evidence that the project will be fully completed in accordance with the applicable plans and specifications. We
also monitor the progress of the development of each project and the accuracy of the developer/operator’s draw requests by having our own in-house inspector perform regular on-site inspections of the project prior to the release of any
requested funds.

Investments in Consolidated and
Non-Consolidated Joint Ventures

Consolidated Joint Ventures

At December 31, 2002, we also had varying percentage interests in several limited liability companies and partnerships that together own 84 facilities and one mortgage, as further discussed below:

(1)

A 77% interest in a partnership (Health Care Property Partners) which owns two acute care hospitals and 18 long-term care facilities and has one mortgage on a
long-term care facility.

(2)

Interests of between 90% and 97% in six partnerships (HCPI/San Antonio Ltd. Partnership, HCPI/Colorado Springs Ltd. Partnership, HCPI/Little Rock Ltd. Partnership,
HCPI/Kansas Ltd. Partnership, Fayetteville Health Associates Ltd. Partnership and Wichita Health Associates Ltd. Partnership), each of which was formed to own a comprehensive rehabilitation hospital.

(3)

Future Acquisitions

We anticipate acquiring additional health
care related facilities and leasing them to health care operators or investing in mortgages secured by health care facilities.

Taxation of HCPI

We believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing


with our taxable year ended December 31, 1985, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. No
assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified. This summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof.

If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This
treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from investment in a corporation. However, we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain
circumstances.

The Code defines a REIT as a
corporation, trust or association (i) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (ii) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) which would be
taxable, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as a domestic corporation; (iv) which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100
or more persons; (vi) during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals; and (vii) which meets certain other tests, described
below, regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets. The Code provides that conditions (i) to (iv), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (v) must be met during at least 335
days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months.

There presently are two gross income requirements. First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from “prohibited
transactions” as defined below) for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at least 95% of
our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75% test and all other dividends, interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or
securities. A “prohibited transaction” is a sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property) held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.

At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of
our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term public debt offering by us (but only for the
one year period after such offering), cash, cash items and government securities. Second, not more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset class. Third, of the investments included in the 25%
asset class, the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10% of the vote or value of the securities of a non-REIT corporation, other than certain debt
securities and interests in taxable REIT subsidiaries, as defined below. Fourth, not more than 20% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We own interests in various partnerships and limited liability
companies. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the Code, Treasury Regulations provide that for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests, the
REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or


limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership or limited
liability company attributable to such share. The ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a REIT may involve special tax risks, including the challenge by the Internal Revenue Service (the “Service”) of
the allocations of income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company, which would affect the computation of taxable income of the REIT, and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership (as
opposed to an association taxable as a corporation) for federal income tax purposes. We also own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries (each a “QRS”). The Code provides that
such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as assets, liabilities and such items of ours. If any partnership, limited
liability company, or subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation (and not as a partnership, QRS or taxable REIT subsidiary) for federal income tax purposes, we would likely fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests
described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a REIT. We believe that each of the partnerships, limited liability companies, and subsidiaries (other than taxable REIT subsidiaries) in which we own an interest will be treated for tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity (in the case of a 100% owned partnership or limited liability company), or QRS, respectively, although no assurance can be given that the Service will not successfully challenge the status of any such
organization.

We also own interests in two
subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a “TRS”). A REIT may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the REIT to be a TRS,
provided certain requirements are met. A TRS generally may engage in any business, including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent REIT and of others, except a TRS may not manage or operate a hotel or health
care facility. A TRS is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates. In addition, a 100% tax may be imposed on a REIT if its rental, service or
other agreements with its TRS, or the TRS’s agreements with the REITs tenants, are not on arms’ length terms.

In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an
amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net income, if any (after tax),
from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such
year, if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and specify the dollar amount in our tax return. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net long-term capital gain or distribute
at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “real estate investment trust taxable income”, as adjusted, we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates. Furthermore, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar
year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our capital gain income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be required to pay a 4% excise tax on the excess of
such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed.

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and certain relief provisions do not apply, we will be required to pay tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular
corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to


qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made. Unless entitled to relief under
specific statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to
the statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness (to the extent borrowings are feasible) or liquidating substantial
investments in order to pay the resulting taxes.

We and our stockholders may be required to pay state or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we or they transact business or reside. The state and local tax treatment of us and our stockholders
may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above.

Government Regulation

The health care industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local laws. This government regulation of the health care industry affects us because:

(1)

The financial ability of lessees to make rent and debt payments to us may be affected by governmental regulations such as licensure, certification for participation
in government programs, and government reimbursement, and

(2)

Our additional rents are often based on our lessees’ gross revenue from operations, which in turn are affected by the amount of reimbursement such lessees
receive from the government.

These
laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. These changes may have a dramatic effect on the
definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third-party payors. These changes may be applied retroactively. The ultimate timing
or effect of these changes cannot be predicted. The failure of any borrower of funds from us or lessee of any of our properties to comply with such laws, regulations and requirements could affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities and
could adversely affect such borrower’s or lessee’s ability to make debt or lease payments to us.

Fraud and Abuse Laws

. There are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud by health care providers who participate in,
receive payments from or are in a position to make referrals in connection with a government-sponsored health care program, including, but not limited to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Specifically, Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act
(the “Anti-Kickback Statute”), the federal self-referral law (Stark), the False Claims Act, and state laws analogous to these federal laws place restrictions on our leasees and other contractors that may affect their core health care
operations.

Federal Anti-kickback
Statute

. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients. Limited “safe
harbor” regulations define a narrow scope of practices that will be exempted from federal prosecution or other enforcement action under the Anti-Kickback Statute and fail to exempt a wide range of activities frequently engaged in by health care
providers and other third parties. Activities that fall outside the safe harbor rules are not


necessarily illegal, although they may be subject to the increased likelihood of scrutiny, investigation
or prosecution. In each case, the government must prove that, in soliciting, offering, paying or accepting remuneration, the parties to such activities intended to induce referrals. A significant body of case law has developed in this area,
providing additional guidance as to the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Furthermore, health care providers may seek advisory opinions from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) concerning the legality of particular relationships
subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute’s prohibitions. Although advisory opinions are binding only on the parties to the opinion, these opinions are often used as guidance in determining the legality of future arrangements.

Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil
and criminal sanctions and penalties. Civil penalties include temporary or permanent exclusion from government health programs. Criminal sanctions include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000, or both, for each violation. The
Balanced Budget Act, signed into law on August 5, 1997 (the “BBA”), expanded the sanctions under the Anti-Kickback Statute to include civil monetary penalties up to $50,000 for each prohibited act and up to three times the total amount of
remuneration offered, paid, solicited, or received, without regard to whether a portion of such remuneration was offered, paid, solicited, or received for a lawful purpose. These penalties and sanctions could be applied with respect to many of our
lessee and our other contractors, including, but not limited to, professional services arrangements and/or space or equipment leases or subleases. Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal Anti-Kickback
Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and other federal government programs. Government sanctions imposed on our lessees and other contractors in violation
of these laws could result in a material adverse effect on their operations which could, in turn, adversely affect our business.

Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition (Stark)

. Absent qualifying for one of the Stark limited exceptions, Stark restricts
physicians who have financial relationships with health care providers from making referrals for certain designated health services for which payment may be made under Medicare or Medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician (or an
immediate family member) has a “financial relationship”. The Stark provisions became effective January 1, 1992 for clinical laboratory services (Stark I) and January 1, 1995 for ten other designated health services (Stark II). The final
Stark I regulations became effective on August 14, 1995 and on January 4, 2001, CMS issued Phase I of the final Stark II regulations. Phase I of the final Stark II regulations focuses on the Stark provisions related to prohibited referrals, the
general exception to ownership and compensation financial arrangement prohibitions and the related definitions. Phase I of the final Stark II regulations clarifies the definition of designated health services and indirect financial relationships and
creates new exceptions for indirect compensation arrangements and fair market value transactions. Most of Phase I of the final Stark II regulations became effective on January 4, 2002. Phase II of the final Stark II regulations was scheduled to be
released in 2002, but has been delayed until sometime in 2003. Phase II of the final Stark II regulations is expected to cover the remaining portions of the Stark statute, including those sections relating to Medicaid.

A “financial relationship” under the Stark
provisions includes any direct or indirect compensation arrangement with an entity for payment of any remuneration, and any direct or indirect ownership or investment interest in the entity. “Designated health services” include inpatient
and outpatient hospital services and do not include skilled nursing services, but do include services which skilled nursing facilities provide to their patients including therapy, durable medical equipment and enteral and parenteral nutrition.
Penalties for violating the Stark provisions include denial of payment


from Medicare and Medicaid programs for any services rendered by an entity in violation of the
prohibition, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 for each offense, additional monetary penalties up to $100,000 for circumvention schemes, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Several states have enacted and/or are considering legislation
that prohibits physician referral arrangements or requires physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a health care provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the BBA expand the penalties for health care fraud, including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, under Operation Restore Trust, a
major anti-fraud demonstration project, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in cooperation with other federal and state agencies, has focused on the activities of skilled nursing facilities, home
health agencies, hospices and durable medical equipment suppliers in certain states, including California, in which we have properties. Due to the success of Operation Restore Trust, the project has been expanded to numerous other states and to
additional providers, including providers of ancillary nursing home services.

False Claims Act

. Another trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act as a means to combat fraud and abuse among health care providers. The
False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs). The False Claims Act provides for liability of up to three times the
amount of damages which the government sustained due to the false claim as well as penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim. Therefore, repeated submissions of a large number of claims based on small billing errors may be treated as multiple
violations of the False Claims Act and can thus result in significant civil monetary penalties. Health care false claims may also subject providers to criminal and civil sanction under state false claims statutes, as well as under common law fraud
statutes.

Although violations of the False
Claims Act are ordinarily initiated by the relevant government agency, such violations can also be initiated by individuals under the

Qui Tam

, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claim Act. The

Qui Tam

provisions allow
individuals with knowledge of False Claims Act violations to bring suit under the False Claims Act on behalf of the federal government.

Qui Tam

plaintiffs may be awarded a significant percentage of the ultimate amount recovered by the
government.

Recently, several False Claims Act
cases have been filed based at least in part on alleged violations of federal health care statutes such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark. In addition, various states are considering or have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims
Act. Even in instances when a whistleblower action is dismissed with no judgment or settlement, the lessee may incur substantial legal fees and other costs relating to an investigation. Certain lessees have been faced with whistleblower suits by
former employees, alleging non-compliance with Medicare rules and regulations. For instance, the U.S. Department of Justice recently joined a whistleblower suit filed against Integrated Health Services, Inc., which alleges that the company admitted
and retained patients in its long-term care hospitals who did not require acute care and billed Medicare for these allegedly unnecessary services. Some Medicare fiscal intermediaries (private companies that contract with CMS to administer the
Medicare program) have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by long-term care providers. Findings of violations of the fraud and abuse laws and regulations may jeopardize a


borrower’s or lessee’s ability to operate a facility or to make rent and debt payments, thereby
potentially adversely affecting us.

Civil
Monetary Penalties Law.

In lieu of, or in addition to, criminal proceedings against a person or entity that has committed a fraudulent act, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to impose an administrative
civil monetary payment under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”). The penalty provisions include all federal health care programs. The amount of the fine is up to $10,000 for each item or service fraudulently claimed for
reimbursement. In addition, under the CMP Law, a damage assessment of up to three times the amount claimed for each claim for services may be assessed. Our lease arrangements with lessees may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws. Federal
and state laws governing illegal rebates and kickbacks regulate contingent or percentage rent arrangements where our co-investors are physicians or others in a position to refer patients to the facilities. Although only limited interpretive or
enforcement guidance is available, we have structured our rent arrangements in a manner that we believe complies with such laws and regulations.

We have no knowledge that would lead us to believe that the facilities in which we have investments are not in substantial compliance with
the various regulatory requirements applicable to them, although there can be no assurance that the operators are in compliance or will remain in compliance in the future.

Licensure Risks

. Most health care facilities must obtain a license from the state in which they
operate. Failure to obtain licensure or loss of licensure would prevent a facility from its ability to provide health care services on the premises. These events could adversely affect the facility operator’s ability to make rent and debt
payments. State and local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and occasionally the contraction of health care facilities by requiring certificate of need or other
similar approval programs. In addition, health care facilities are obligated to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and building and safety codes which govern access to and physical design requirements and building standards for
facilities.

Environmental Matters

. A wide
variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real
property or a secured lender (such as us) may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or
toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or secured lender knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or
disposal of such substances and may be imposed on the owner or secured lender in connection with the activities of an operator of the property. The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s
or secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances,
may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, would reduce our revenue.


Although the
mortgage loans that we provide and leases covering our properties require the borrower and the lessee to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, the scope of such obligations may be limited and we cannot assure that any such borrower or
lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations.

The Federal Medicare and Medicaid Programs

. Sources of revenue for lessees and mortgagors may include the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health care service plans and health
maintenance organizations, among others. Efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators. In addition, the failure of
any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and their ability to continue to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Prospective Payment for Hospital Inpatient Services.

Medicare payments to acute care hospitals for
inpatient services are based on a prospective payment system (“PPS”). Under PPS, a hospital is paid a prospectively established rate based on the category (“Diagnostic Related Group” or “DRG”) in which a patient’s
diagnosis is classified. Beginning in 1991, Medicare payments began to phase-in PPS for capital-related inpatient costs over a ten year period. Thus, current Medicare reimbursement to hospitals for capital-related inpatient costs is based on
prospective rates rather than the cost-based reimbursement system previously used. DRG rates are subject to adjustment on an annual basis as part of the federal budget reconciliation process. In addition, the BBA mandated the establishment of
prospective payment systems for skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospital outpatient departments, and rehabilitation hospitals. See “Health Care Reform” section and further discussion following.

Prospective Payment for Hospital Outpatient Services

.
Beginning in August 2000, CMS began to reimburse items and services furnished in hospital outpatient departments under a prospective payment system (“Outpatient PPS”) under which all services are categorized into groups called Ambulatory
Payment Classifications (“APCs”). Each APC is comprised of a bundle of like outpatient services that are reimbursed at a prospectively established payment rate. Hospitals are reimbursed additional amounts for certain drugs, biologies, and
technologies. APC rates are subject to adjustment on an annual basis.

Prospective Payment for Skilled Nursing Facilities

. Prior to July 1, 1998, Medicare programs utilized a cost-based reimbursement system for skilled nursing facilities, which reimbursed these facilities for the
reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs incurred in providing routine services plus in certain states, a return on equity, subject to certain cost ceilings. These costs normally included allowances for administrative and general costs as well
as the costs of property and equipment (depreciation and interest, fair rental allowance or rental expense). Cost-based reimbursement was typically subject to retrospective adjustment through cost report settlement, and for certain states, payments
made to a facility on an interim basis that were subsequently determined to be less than or in excess of allowable costs could be adjusted through future payments to the affected facility. State Medicaid reimbursement programs varied as to the
methodology used to determine the level of allowable costs which were reimbursed to operators.

The BBA mandated implementation of a per diem prospective payment system to be implemented for skilled nursing facilities (“SNF PPS”) under which skilled nursing facilities are paid a
case-mix adjusted federal per diem rate for Medicare-covered services provided by the skilled nursing


facilities. The per diem rate is calculated to cover routine service costs, ancillary costs and most
capital-related costs (see further discussion under Health Care Reform). The SNF PPS federal rates are adjusted based upon case-mix and geography and are subject to annual updates. The phased-in implementation of the SNF PPS began with the first
cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 1998.

Prospective Payment for Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

. Although most hospitals were transferred to the PPS reimbursement methodology in 1983, certain specialty hospitals were excluded from that system. LTACs were one of the
exempted types of specialty hospitals. Faced with escalating health care costs, however, congress mandated that by October 1, 2002, LTACs be transitioned from a reasonable cost-based reimbursement system to a congressionally mandated prospective
payment system (“LTAC PPS”). CMS has met the statutory implementation date mandate by establishing October 2, 2002 as the effective date of the LTAC PPS, with system changes to follow. The full impact of the new reimbursement methodology
is still to be seen.

State Medicaid
Programs.

Medicaid programs differ in respect from state to state but they are all subject to federally-imposed requirements. At least 50% of the funds available under these programs is provided by the federal government under a matching
program. Medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates; long-term care facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates. Medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for
lessee-operated facilities. Increasingly, states have introduced managed care contracting techniques in the administration of Medicaid programs. Such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement to lessee-operated
facilities.

Other third party payors in various
states and areas base payments on costs, retail rates or, increasingly, negotiated rates. Negotiated rates can include discounts from normal charges, fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates.

Regulations Affecting Long-Term Care Facilities.

Long-term care facilities are regulated primarily through the licensing of such facilities against a common background established by federal law enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. Regulatory authorities and licensing
standards vary from state to state, and in some instances from locality to locality. These standards are constantly reviewed and revised. State agencies periodically inspect facilities to determine whether they comply with state and/or federal
regulations, at which time deficiencies may be identified. The facilities must correct these deficiencies as a condition to continued licensing or certification and participation in government reimbursement programs. Depending on the nature of such
deficiencies, remedies can be routine or costly. Similarly, compliance with regulations which cover a broad range of areas such as patients’ rights, staff training, quality of life and quality of resident care may increase facility start-up and
operating costs.

In 1999 and 2000, Congress
increased funding for state health agencies in order to allow state agencies that conduct skilled nursing facility inspections to intensify Medicare and Medicaid regulatory enforcement efforts. CMS has instructed these state agencies to increase the
number of unannounced facility inspections and to investigate consumer complaints about skilled nursing facilities promptly. As a result of these increased enforcement efforts, some of our lessees may be subject to fines and other penalties that
could increase their operating costs.


Acute Care
Hospitals

. Acute care hospitals are also subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Acute care hospitals undergo periodic inspections regarding standards of medical care, equipment and hygiene as a condition of state licensure.
Various licenses and permits also are required for purchasing and administering narcotics, operating laboratories and pharmacies and the use of radioactive materials and certain equipment. Each of our facilities, the operation of which requires
accreditation, is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. Such accreditation may be a more cost-effective and time-efficient method of meeting requirements for continued licensing and for participation in
government sponsored provider programs.

Acute
care hospitals must comply with requirements for various forms of utilization review. In addition, under PPS, each state must have a Peer Review Organization (also known as a Quality Improvement Organization) to carry out federally funded mandated
reviews of Medicare patient admissions, treatment and discharges in acute care hospitals.

Assisted Living Facilities

. Certain assisted living facilities are subject to federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws. These laws regulate, among other matters, the
number of licensed beds, the provision of services, equipment, staffing and operating policies and procedures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement, the imposition of fines, suspension from
federal and state health care programs and, in extreme cases, decertification from federal and state health care programs, revocation of a facility’s operating license or closure of a facility. Such actions may have an effect on the revenue of
the operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely impact us.

Entrance Fee Communities

. Certain of the facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a
resident in exchange for some form of long-term benefit. Typically, entrance fees are broken into two components, a refundable component and a non-refundable component. The percentage of each component varies based upon the different contract
alternatives at each entrance fee community. Some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility’s financial condition, establishment and monitoring of
reserve requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters. Such oversight
and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore adversely impact us.

Physician Group Practice Clinics

. Physician group practice clinics are subject to extensive federal,
state and local legislation and regulation. Every state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and on facilities and services operated by physicians. In addition, federal and state laws regulate health maintenance organizations and
other managed care organizations with which physician groups may have contracts. Many states require regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before establishing certain types of physician-directed clinics, offering certain services or
making expenditures in excess of statutory thresholds for health care equipment, facilities or programs. In connection with the expansion of existing operations and the entry into new markets, physician clinics and affiliated practice groups may
become subject to compliance with additional regulation.

Rehabilitation Hospitals

. Rehabilitation hospitals are subject to extensive federal, state and local legislation, regulation, inspection and licensure requirements similar to those of acute care


hospitals. Many states have
adopted a “patient’s bill of rights” which provides for certain higher standards for patient care that are designed to decrease restrictions and enhance dignity in treatment.

Health Care Reform

The health care industry continues to face various challenges,
including increased government and private payor pressure on health care providers to control costs, the migration of patients from acute care facilities into extended care and home care settings, and the vertical and horizontal consolidation of
health care providers. The pressure to control health care costs intensified during 1994 and 1995 as a result of the national health care reform debate and continued as Congress attempted to slow the rate of growth of federal health care
expenditures as part of its effort to balance the federal budget.

Changes in the law, new interpretations of existing laws, and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing
business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by both government and other third-party payors. These changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances. The ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and
may impact us in different ways.

The Balanced
Budget Act of 1997.

The BBA was designed to produce several billion dollars in net savings for the Medicare and Medicaid programs over the five years following enactment.

The BBA repealed the Boren Amendment under which states were required to pay long-term care providers,
including skilled nursing facilities, rates that were “reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities.” As a result, states are now required by the BBA to do the
following with respect to skilled nursing facility rates:

•

Use a public process for determining rates;

•

Publish proposed and final rates, the methodologies underlying the rates, and justifications for the rates and

•

Give interested parties a reasonable opportunity for review and comment on the proposed rates, methodologies and justifications.

In determining reimbursement rates, consideration is given to
health care providers that serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients with special needs. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is required to conduct a study concerning the effect of rate-setting methodologies on
the access to and the quality of services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and report the study results to Congress.

The BBA also provides the federal government with expanded enforcement powers to combat waste, fraud and abuse in delivery of health care
services and promulgated larger penalties for fraud and abuse violations. Though applicable to payments for services furnished on or after October 1, 1997, the new requirements are not retroactive. The BBA also strengthened the anti-fraud and abuse
laws to provide for stiffer penalties for fraud and abuse violations as discussed previously.


The BBA also
reduced the payments made to long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACs”). Regarding LTACs, the BBA reduced the amount of reimbursement for incentive payments established pursuant to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982
(“TEFRA”) for capital expenditures and bad debts, and for services to certain patients transferred from an acute care hospital. In addition, the BBA for the first time imposed a national ceiling limitation or “national cap” on
payments that may be made in each category of hospitals exempt from a prospective payment system. LTACs constitute one such category. The reduction in payments to LTACs mandated by the BBA may adversely effect an LTAC operator’s ability to
develop or acquire LTACs in the future.

The
Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999

. In November 1999, President Clinton signed into law the Medicare, Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Policy (SCHIP) Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA”) which reduces
some of the reimbursement cutbacks enacted under the BBA. The BBRA delayed implementation of cost-cutting measures and increased payments to some sectors of the health care industry. The BBRA increased payments to long-term care facilities and
lessened cutbacks made to disproportionate share hospital payments. The BBRA also provided that changes to the Outpatient PPS must be budget neutral and not result in reduced reimbursement. The extent of the financial relief to be provided by the
BBRA is estimated to be $16 billion over five years.

The Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000.

In December 2000, President Clinton signed the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”),
which provides for across-the-board Medicare and Medicaid payment increases for most health care providers. Overall, passage of BIPA is expected to result in approximately $35 billion in additional reimbursement for providers over the next five
years. Additionally, the BIPA extends the moratorium on implementation of a cap for outpatient therapy services throughout 2002. Payments for home health services, hospice services, and LTAC services will also increase under the provisions of the
BIPA.

With respect to skilled nursing
facilities, to supplement the transition from cost-based reimbursement to SNF PPS, the BBRA and BIPA mandated that skilled nursing facilities temporarily receive certain payments in addition to straight SNF PPS reimbursement. For two of the
temporary add-on payments that were set to expire on September 30, 2002, CMS extended the expiration date to at least fiscal year 2004. The remaining two add-on payments, however, did expire as of September 30, 2002. Industry advocates predict that
the expiration of the latter two add-on payments will cost skilled nursing facilities approximately $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2003, which could represent a loss of as much as $30 per resident per day.

Other federal initiatives will result in greater operational
expenditures for health care providers. For instance, HIPAA requires a significant overhaul of health care information systems to protect individually identifiable medical information and to standardize formatting of health care claims via
electronic data codes. In November 1999, the Department of Health and Human Services released proposed privacy regulations to protect the confidentiality of individual health information. Final privacy regulations were released in December 2000.
Generally, health care providers must comply with the HIPAA privacy regulations by April 14, 2003. The federal government has estimated that the United States health care industry will spend approximately $18 billion over a ten-year period in order
to achieve compliance with these new privacy requirements.


In August
2000, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also released final regulations that delineated uniform, national standards for the electronic exchange of medical information and filing of claims under HIPAA. Health care providers must have
complied with these regulations relating to electronic data by October 16, 2002, or have received a waiver from the Department to extend the deadline for compliance to October 16, 2003. The federal government estimates that HIPAA compliance will
cost health care providers approximately $3.5 billion. However, the federal government has predicted that implementation of these uniform data standards will help to speed conversion from manual to electronic billing systems, resulting in cost
savings to health care providers of approximately $30 billion over the next decade.

In addition to the reforms enacted and considered by Congress from time to time, state legislatures periodically consider various health care reform proposals. Congress and state legislatures can be
expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems, new regulatory enforcement initiatives, and new payment methodologies. Public debate of these issues can be expected to continue in the future. There are numerous
initiatives at the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for and delivery of health care services. Changes in the law, new interpretations of existing laws, and changes in payment methodology and enforcement
priorities may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third-party payors. These changes may
be applied retroactively. The ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways.

National health care spending accelerated 8.7 percent in 2001, reaching $1.4 trillion in total, or $5,035 per capita. Prompted mostly by
sluggish economic growth and to some extent by faster-paced health spending, the share of Gross Domestic Product for health care spiked 0.8 percentage points in 2001 to 14.1 percent. Total public funding continued to accelerate, increasing 9.4
percent in 2001 and exceeding private funding growth for the second consecutive year. Public payments rose to $647 billion and paid for 45 percent of the nation’s health. Important sources of growth were payment increases to Medicare providers
by the BBRA and BIPA as well as increased Medicaid spending. Medicare expenditures increased 7.8 percent to $242 billion is 2001, and financed one-sixth of overall health care costs. With expenditures only slightly less than Medicare’s, Federal
and State Medicaid funded $224 billion in 2001. The weak economy and rising unemployment contributed to increased Medicaid enrollment (up 8.5 percent) and to a faster pace of spending growth in 2001 (up 10.8 percent) than in 2000 (up 8.8 percent).
We believe that government and private efforts to contain or reduce health care costs will continue. These trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our lessees and mortgagors. We
believe that the vast nature of the health care industry, the financial strength and operating flexibility of our operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any such diminution in reimbursements. However, we cannot
predict whether any of the above proposals or any other proposals will be adopted and, if adopted, no assurance can be given that the implementation of such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.

Objectives and Policies

We are organized to invest in income-producing health care
related facilities. In evaluating potential investments, we consider such factors as:

•

The geographic area, type of property and demographic profile;


•

The location, construction quality, condition and design of the property;

•

The expertise and reputation of the operator;

•

The current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs and lease obligations;

•

Whether the rent provides a competitive market return to our investors;

•

The potential for capital appreciation;

•

The tax laws related to real estate investment trusts;

•

The regulatory and reimbursement environment in which the properties operate;

•

Occupancy and demand for similar health facilities in the same or nearby communities;

•

An adequate mix between private and government sponsored patients at health facilities;

•

Potential alternative uses of the facilities; and

•

Prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing.

There are no limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property or partnership. The Investment
Committee of the Board of Directors may establish limitations as it deems appropriate from time to time. No limits have been set on the number of properties in which we will seek to invest, or on the concentration of investments in any one facility
or any one city or state. We acquire our investments primarily for income.

At December 31, 2002, we had three series of preferred stock, $177.9 million in mortgage notes payable and $888.1 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities which are senior to the common
stock. We may, in the future, issue additional debt or equity securities which will be senior to the common stock. We have authority to offer shares of our capital stock in exchange for investments which conform to our standards and to repurchase or
otherwise acquire our shares or other securities.

We may incur additional indebtedness when, in the opinion of our management and directors, it is advisable. For short-term purposes we from time to time negotiate lines of credit, or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks
or otherwise. We arrange for long-term borrowings through public offerings or from institutional investors.

In addition, we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate which we have acquired through purchase, foreclosure or
otherwise. Where leverage is present on terms deemed favorable, we invest in properties subject to existing loans, or secured by mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on the properties. We also may obtain non-recourse or other mortgage
financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis.

In March 2001, we introduced a new Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan”). Under the terms of the Plan,
existing stockholders may purchase shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash dividends from their shares of common stock, or by making optional cash payments to purchase additional shares of common stock.

On June 20, 2000 we adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan and
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock. The rights will become exercisable if a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire,
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock or following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer the


consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of our
common stock. After the rights become exercisable, each right will entitle the holder to purchase from us one one-hundredth (1/100

th

) of a share of Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $95 per one one-hundredth (1/100

th

) of a Preferred Share, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The rights will at no time have any voting rights.

Each Series D Preferred Share purchasable upon exercise of the rights will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum
preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1.00 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 100 times the dividend, if any, declare per common share. In the event our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of the Series
D Preferred Shares will be entitled to a preferential liquidation payment of $100 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends but will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 100 times the payment made per common share. Each Series D Preferred
Share will have 100 votes and will vote together with our common stock. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of our common stock are exchanged, each Series D Preferred Share will be entitled to
receive 100 times the amount received per share of common stock. Series D Preferred Shares will not be redeemable. The rights are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions. Because of the nature of the Preferred Share’s dividend,
liquidation and voting rights, the value of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one common share.

Under certain circumstances, each holder of a right, other than rights that are or were acquired or
beneficially owned by a person or group acquiring 15% or more (which rights will thereafter be void), will have the right to receive upon exercise that number of common shares having a market value of two times the then current purchase price of one
right. In the event that, after a person acquired 15% or more of our common stock, we were acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or more than 50% of our assets or earning power were sold, each holder of a right shall have
the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current purchase price of the right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction would have a market value of two times the then
current purchase price of one right.

The rights
may be redeemed by the Board of Directors at any time prior to the time a person or group acquires 15% or more of our common stock.

The rights will expire on July 27, 2010 (unless earlier redeemed, exchanged or terminated). The Bank of New York is the Rights Agent.

The rights are designed to assure that all of
our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of us and to guard against partial tender offers, open market accumulations and other abusive tactics to gain control of us without paying all stockholders a
control premium. The rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15% or more of our stock on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. The rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by the Board of Directors at any time prior to the first date that a person or group acquires 15% or more of our common stock.

We will not, without the prior approval of a majority of directors, acquire from or sell to any director, officer or employee of HCPI, or
any affiliate thereof, as the case may be, any of our assets or other property.


We provide to
our stockholders annual reports containing audited financial statements and quarterly reports containing unaudited information.

The policies set forth herein have been established by our Board of Directors and may be changed without stockholder approval.

Boyer

. On January 25, 1999, we completed the acquisition of a managing member interest in HCPI/Utah, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“HCPI/Utah”), in exchange for a cash contribution of approximately $18.9
million. In connection with this acquisition, several limited liability companies and general partnerships affiliated with The Boyer Company, L.C. (“Boyer”) contributed a portfolio of 14 medical office buildings (including two ground
leaseholds associated therewith) to HCPI/Utah with an aggregate equity value (net of assumed debt) of approximately $18.9 million. In exchange for this capital contribution, the contributing entities received 593,247 non-managing member units of
HCPI/Utah. HCPI/Utah also issued 590,555 managing member units to HCPI. At the initial closing, HCPI/Utah was also granted the right to acquire additional medical office buildings. Four additional buildings have been contributed to HCPI/Utah and the
contributing entities received 133,134 non-managing member units of HCPI/Utah and 510,609 managing member units were issued to us. An additional 56,489 non-managing member units were received by the contributing entities as a result of step-ups in
value of certain of the buildings.

The Amended
and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of HCPI/Utah (the “Agreement”) provides that only we are authorized to act on behalf of HCPI/Utah and that we have responsibility for the management of its business.


The
non-managing member units are exchangeable for common stock on a one for one basis (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications) or for an amount of cash equal to then-current market value of the shares of common stock
into which the non-managing member units may be exchanged. HCPI/Utah relied on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with the issuance and sale of the non-managing member units. We have
registered 753,273 shares of our common stock for issuance from time to time in exchange for units.

On August 17, 2001, we completed the acquisition of a managing member interest in HCPI/Utah, II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(“HCPI/Utah II”), in exchange for a cash contribution of approximately $32.8 million. In connection with the acquisition, several limited liability companies and general partnerships affiliated with Boyer, contributed a portfolio of four
medical office buildings and five health care laboratory and biotech research facilities (seven of which buildings are owned through ground leasehold interests) to HCPI/Utah II with an aggregate equity value (net of assumed debt) of approximately
$25.7 million. In exchange for this capital contribution, the contributing entities received 738,923 non-managing units of HCPI/Utah II. HCPI/Utah II also issued 942,670 managing member units to HCPI. At the initial closing, HCPI/Utah II was also
granted the right to acquire eight additional medical office buildings. Subsequent contributions have resulted in the acquisition of three additional buildings. During 2002, HCPI/Utah II was granted the right to acquire and a new contributing entity
contributed one additional medical office building to HCPI/Utah II. In connection with the contribution of these four buildings, the contributing entity has received 156,244 non-managing member units and 270,947 managing member units have been
issued to us. An additional 70,545 non-managing member units were received by the contributing entities in 2002 as a result of step-ups in value of certain of the buildings.

The Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of HCPI/Utah II, as amended (the “HCPI/Utah
II Agreement”) provides that only we are authorized to act on behalf of HCPI/Utah II and that we have responsibility for the management of its business. Finally, in 2002, HCPI/Utah II completed documentation relating to the construction of a
new building adjacent to one of the contributed projects. Upon completion of construction, the original contributing entity is entitled to receive certain non-managing member units in accordance with the terms of the agreements among the parties and
we will receive managing member units.

The
non-managing member units are exchangeable for common stock on a one-for one basis (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications) or for an amount of cash equal to the then-current market value of the shares of common
stock into which the non-managing member units may be exchanged. HCPI/Utah II relied on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with the issuance and sale of the non-managing member units

.

We have registered 738,923 shares of our common stock for issuance from time to time in exchange for units.


Item 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL
DATA

Set forth below is our selected
financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998.

(1)

We believe that Funds From Operations (“FFO”) is an important supplemental measure of operating performance (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements). We adopted the new definition of FFO prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). FFO is defined as Net Income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property, plus real estate depreciation, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO does not, and is not intended to, represent cash
generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income. FFO, as defined by us
may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other REITs that do not define it in accordance with the definition prescribed by NAREIT. The following table represents items and amounts being aggregated to compute FFO.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Health Care Property Investors, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated joint ventures (HCPI), generally acquires
health care facilities and leases them on a long-term basis to health care providers. We also lease medical office space to providers and physicians on a shorter term basis. In addition, we provide mortgage financing on health care facilities. As of
December 31, 2002, our portfolio of properties, including equity investments, consisted of 463 facilities located in 43 states. These facilities are comprised of 184 long-term care facilities, 101 assisted living facilities, 90 medical office
buildings (including five health and wellness centers), 35 physician group practice clinics, 22 acute care hospitals, 14 retirement living communities, nine freestanding rehabilitation facilities and eight health care laboratory and biotech research
facilities. Our gross investment in the properties, which includes our proportional interest in joint venture acquisitions, was approximately $3.1 billion at December 31, 2002.

The primary focus of operations for 2002 was the completion of $417 million of new investments. We financed
the acquisitions primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of new debt, new equity and asset sales.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we completed $232,000,000 in property acquisitions, invested $155,000,000 in new loans and equity
opportunities and committed to $30,000,000 of new construction and expansion projects for a total $417,000,000 of new investments. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we completed $190,000,000 in property acquisitions, invested $10,000,000 in
new loans and equity opportunities and committed to $40,000,000 of new construction and expansion projects for a total $240,000,000 of new investments.

Accounting Estimates

The following are our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates and the issues which impact those estimates:

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recorded in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101), as amended. SAB 101 requires that revenue be recognized after four basic criteria are met. These four criteria include persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the rendering of
service, fixed and determinable income and reasonably assured collectibility. If the collectibility of revenue is determined incorrectly, the amount and timing of our reported revenue could be significantly affected. See Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

Rental revenue from our tenants is our
principal source of revenue. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an on-going basis. Based on these reviews, we have established provisions and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments. An allowance for doubtful


accounts is recorded during
each period and is recorded against rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. The total amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents the cumulative allowances less write-offs of uncollectible rent, is recorded
against tenant and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheets. If we incorrectly estimate the required allowances for doubtful accounts, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected.

Depreciation and Useful Lives of Assets

We compute depreciation on our properties using the
straight-line method based on an estimated useful life ranging up to 45 years. A significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to building (usually approximately 90%). The allocation of the acquisition cost to building
and the determination of the useful life of a property are based on appraisals commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms. We compute depreciation on equipment, tenant improvements and lease costs using the straight-line method on an
estimated useful life ranging up to 10 years or the lease term, whichever is appropriate. If we do not allocate appropriately to building or incorrectly estimate the useful life of our properties, the computation of depreciation will not
appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically review long-lived assets (primarily real estate, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and notes receivable) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of the fair value of the investment involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on analysis of the future operating results or projected rents for each long-lived asset. Our ability
to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value.

If a decline in the fair market value of a long-lived asset occurs, we may be required to make determination as to whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary. Our assessment as to the
nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of expectations of future rents or future operating results, and our intent to hold the long-lived asset. If an investment is considered impaired and the decline in value is
considered to be other than temporary, a write-down is recognized.

Discontinued Operations

We have reclassified certain facilities’ operations as Discontinued Operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(Statement 144) which was issued in August 2001. Statement 144 established accounting and reporting standards requiring that long-lived assets to be disposed of be reported as Discontinued Operations if management has committed to a plan to sell the
asset under usual and customary terms within one year of establishing the plan to sell. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of Statement 144 on previously reported periods.

Stock Options

As of January 1, 2002, we commenced recognizing compensation
expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” (Statement 123). The implementation of Statement 123 is prospective and therefore 2001 operating


results have not been
impacted. We use the Black Scholes model for calculating stock option expense. This model requires us to make certain estimates including stock volatility, discount rate and the termination discount factor. If we incorrectly estimate these
variables, our results of operations could be affected.

Results of Operations

Year Ended
December 31, 2002 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $112,480,000 or $1.93 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $359,576,000. This compares to Net Income applicable to common shares of
$96,266,000 or $1.78 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $328,116,000 for 2001. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002, is a net loss on real estate dispositions of $1,130,000, or $0.02 per
share on a diluted basis, and a write-down of $9,200,000, or $0.15 per share on a diluted basis, to fair value of eight facilities (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year
ended December 31 2001 is a net loss on real estate dispositions of $5,048,000, or $0.09 per share on a diluted basis, and a write-down of $7,360,000, or $0.14 per share on a diluted basis, to fair value of seven facilities.

Rental Income attributable to Triple-Net Leases for the year
ended December 31, 2002 increased 7.6%, or $16,959,000, to $240,537,000. The increase is primarily the result of acquisitions made during 2001 and 2002 which resulted in the addition of 39 more facilities (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements). Rental Income attributable to Managed Properties for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 10.3% or $8,512,000, to $91,200,000 with a related increase in Managed Properties Operating Expenses of 11.0% or $3,256,000, to $32,720,000.
These increases were generated primarily from 2001 and 2002 acquisition and construction activity which resulted in the addition of 17 more facilities (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest and Other Income for the year
ended December 31, 2002, increased 27.4%, or $5,989,000 to $27,839,000 as a result of the new loan with ARC (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) as well as a loan prepayment fee we collected in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Interest Expense for the year ended December 31,
2002, decreased $537,000 to $77,952,000. The decrease is primarily due to the refinancing of $124,579,000 of long-term debt with lower rate short-term and long-term debt. Real Estate Depreciation increased 9% or $6,383,000 to $75,722,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of the 2002 and 2001 acquisitions. General and Administrative Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 40%, or $5,233,000, to $18,408,000. The increase is primarily the result of costs of
$2,600,000 related to vacant and troubled properties and compensation costs. As of January 1, 2002, we commenced recognizing compensation expense in accordance with Statement 123. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe that Funds From Operations (FFO) is an important
supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 11.1% or $19,835,000 to $199,210,000. The increase is mainly
attributable to investments made during 2002 offset by increases in General and Administrative costs.

We adopted the definition of FFO prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). FFO is defined as Net
Income applicable to common shares (computed


in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property, plus real estate depreciation, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO does not, and is not intended
to, represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income. FFO,
as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other REITs that do not define it in accordance with the definition prescribed by NAREIT. The following table represents items and amounts being aggregated to compute
FFO.

Year Ended December
31, 2001 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000

Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $96,266,000 or $1.78 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $328,116,000. This compares to Net Income applicable to common shares of $108,867,000
or $2.13 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $325,358,000 for the corresponding period in 2000. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 is a Loss Real Estate Dispositions of
$5,048,000, or $0.90 per share on a diluted basis, and a Gain on Real Estate Dispositions of $11,756,000, or $0.23 per share on a diluted basis, respectively. In addition, Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2001
includes a write-down of $7,360,000, or $0.14 per share on a diluted basis, to fair market value of seven facilities. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2000 are a $2,000,000, or $0.04 per share on a
diluted basis, one-time charge as a result of an equity investment write-off and a $2,751,000, or $0.05 per share on a diluted basis one-time charge as a result of the write-down to fair value less costs to sell of four physician clinics to be sold.
The increase in Net Income applicable to common shares is primarily the result of 2000 acquisition activity.

Rental Income attributable to Triple Net Leases for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased 0.2%, or $675,000, to $223,578,000. The
decrease is primarily the result of the impact of dispositions made during 2000 and 2001 offset by acquisition activity during 2001. Rental Income, attributable to Managed Properties for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased 5.7%, or
$4,458,000, to $82,688,000 with a related increase in Managed Properties Operating Expenses of 7.3%, or $2,010,000, to $29,464,000. These increases were generated primarily from 2001 acquisition activity which resulted in the addition of 13
facilities. Interest and Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased 4.5%, or $1,025,000, to $21,850,000 primarily as a result of a loan payoff in the first quarter of 2001.


Interest
Expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased 9.5% or $8,258,000 to $78,489,000. The decrease is primarily the result of lower balances and interest rates on short-term bank loans all described in more detail within the “Liquidity and
Capital Resources” section. Real Estate Depreciation increased $731,000 to $69,339,000 as a result of 2001 acquisitions.

FFO for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased 4.7% or $8,031,000 to $179,375,000. The increase is mainly attributable to increases in
Rental Income, as offset by increases in Interest Expense and Managed Properties Operating Expenses previously discussed in more detail.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have financed investments through the sale of common and preferred stock, the issuance of long-term debt, the assumption of mortgage
debt, the mortgaging of certain of our properties, the use of short-term bank lines, the use of internally generated cash flows and through the disposition of assets. Management believes that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to
finance our operations for the foreseeable future. Future investments in additional facilities (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) will be dependent on the availability of cost-effective sources of capital.

At December 31, 2002, stockholders’ equity totaled
$1,280,889,000. Our debt to equity ratio was 1.04 to 1.00. For the year ended December 31, 2002, FFO (before interest expense) covered Interest Expense 3.50 to 1.00.

Equity

In May 2001, we issued 4,025,000 shares of common stock at $34.80 per share, generating net proceeds of $133,000,000. In March 2001 we
introduced our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP). As of December 31, 2002, 2,946,974 shares have been issued with net proceeds of $113,191,788 realized under the DRIP. During the year ended December 31, 2002, an additional
$18,197,000 has been realized through the exercise of stock options.

We used the net equity proceeds to pay down short-term borrowings under our revolving lines of credit pending deployment on long-term investments. We invested any excess funds in short-term investments until they were needed
for acquisitions or development.

As of December
31, 2002, there were a total of 1,678,512 non-managing member units outstanding in three limited liability companies of which we are the managing member: HCPI/Utah, LLC, HCPI/Utah II, LLC and HCPI/Indiana, LLC. These non-managing member units are
currently convertible into our common stock on a one-for-one basis. During 2002, we issued 126,250 non-managing member units of HCPI/Utah II, LLC as part of the acquisition of one medical office building and one health care laboratory and biotech
research facility. In addition, during 2002, 124,487 non-managing member units were converted into the same number of shares of our common stock.


Senior Unsecured
Debt

In June 2002, we issued
$250,000,000 of 6.45% coupon (6.74% effective rate after including related costs) Senior Notes due 2012. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in June and December.

The following table summarizes the Medium Term Note (MTN) financing activities since January 2000:

Since
1986 debt rating agencies have rated our Senior Notes investment grade. Current senior debt ratings are Baa2 from Moody’s and BBB+ from both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.

Secured Debt

At December 31, 2002, we had a total of $177,922,000 in Mortgage Notes Payable secured by 35 health care facilities with a net book value
of approximately $309,734,000. Interest rates on the Mortgage Notes ranged from 2.78% to 10.63%.

As part of our investment in ARC (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), we have a 9.8% equity interest in each of seven limited liability companies which own an aggregate of nine
retirement living communities. The nine retirement living communities owned by the seven limited liability companies collateralize approximately $170,000,000 of first mortgages with fixed and variable interest rates ranging from 2.25% to 9.5% and
maturity dates ranging from May 2004 to June 2025.

During 2001, we assumed secured debt of $18,600,000 in connection with the acquisition of a $126,000,000 transaction to acquire entities controlled by The Boyer Company.

During 2000, we completed a secured debt transaction which in the aggregate resulted in loan proceeds of
$83,000,000 on a portfolio of 12 medical office buildings and physician clinics with an investment value of approximately $138,000,000. The loan features an average coupon of 8.12% (8.43% effective rate) with a ten year term. These proceeds were
used to fund the final payment of our convertible subordinated notes due November 8, 2000.


Revolving Lines of Credit

In October 2002, we closed on a new three
year revolving line of credit totaling $490,000,000, an increase of nearly $100,000,000 over our prior bank lines. As of December 31, 2002, we had a total of $219,000,000 available on this line.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have an 80% interest in each of five joint ventures that
lease six long-term care facilities a 45%-50% interest in four joint ventures that each operate an assisted living facility and a 9.8% interest in seven limited liability companies with ARC owning an aggregate of nine retirement living communities
(see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Investments in Consolidated and Non-Consolidated Joint Ventures in Item I above). Since the other members in these joint ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition, sale
and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting.

Combined summarized unaudited financial information of our investment in ARC and the unconsolidated joint ventures follows:

We have
guaranteed approximately $6.8 million on notes payable obligations for four of the other joint ventures.


Contractual Obligations and
Contingent Liabilities

As of December 31,
2002, our contractual payment obligations and contingent liabilities were as follows:

Other

During the first two quarters of 2000, we
repurchased $31,090,000 of our 6% convertible subordinated notes due November 8, 2000 in open market transactions at a gain of $274,000. The balance of $68,910,000 was paid off on the due date.

Retained Cash Flows

Since our inception in May 1985, we have recorded
approximately $1,354,918,000 in FFO. Of this amount, we have distributed a total of $1,171,124,000, or 86.4%, to stockholders as dividends on common stock. We have retained the balance of $183,794,000 and used it as an additional source of capital.

Total dividends paid on common stock during the
year ended December 31, 2002 were $188,449,000, and as a percentage of FFO was 94.6%. During the first quarter of 2003, we declared a dividend of $0.83 per common share or approximately $49,500,000 in the aggregate.

Available Shelf Registrations

In April 2002, we filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $975,000,000 of debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time. As of December 31, 2002, we have $725,000,000 available for future issuances of debt and equity securities.

Letters of Credit and Security Deposits

At December 31, 2002, we held approximately $12,346,000 in
depository accounts and $47,396,000 in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks to secure a number of lessees’ lease and borrowers’ loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are any
defaults under the leases or loans. Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors, and such changes may be material.


Facility Rollovers

We have concluded a significant number of
“facility rollover” transactions on properties that have been under long-term leases and mortgages. Facility rollover transactions principally include lease renewals and renegotiations, leases with new operators on an existing property,
exchanges, sales of properties and payoffs on mortgage receivables. The annualized impact on a pro forma FFO basis as if the facility rollover transactions had occurred on January 1 of each year and the number of facility rollovers is listed below.
Sales of properties and mortgage receivable pay off proceeds are assumed to be reinvested at 10% for purposes of the table.

For the
years ending December 31, 2003 and 2004, we have 33 facilities and 14 facilities in the triple net lease portfolio, respectively, that are subject to lease expiration and mortgage maturities. Including lease expirations in the managed portfolio, the
percentage of our total revenue subject to lease expirations and mortgage maturities are 3.2% for 2003 and 17.5% for 2004.

Facility Operators

Tenet

Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”) leases from us eight acute care hospitals and one medical office building in which we
have an aggregate investment of $460,000,000. Rents from these hospitals constitute approximately 16% of our revenue. According to news reports, the U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a lawsuit against Tenet for allegedly submitting
fraudulent claims to Medicare. The lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of triple damages and civil penalties under the False Claims Act. Tenet announced their intention to adopt new policies as of January 1, 2003. We estimate that, if
payments at our eight Tenet operated hospitals are reduced in proportion to Tenet’s announcement, rents paid to us would decrease by $500,000 per year and the cash flow coverage of rents after management fees would decrease from 5.1 to 4.5.


Troubled Long-Term Care and
Assisted Living Operators

The financial
weakness of operators in the long-term care and assisted living sectors may result in some uncertainties in our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators’ leases. We cannot assure you that the bankruptcies of certain
long-term care operators and the trouble experienced by assisted living operators would not have a material adverse effect on our Net Income, FFO or the market value of our common stock (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Centennial

In early December 2002, we sent default and lease termination
notices to Centennial Healthcare Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (“Centennial”) for non-payment of rent under 17 leases and non-payment of interest and principal under a secured loan, and to a third party lessee for non-payment
of rent on three facilities managed by Centennial. On December 20, 2002, Centennial filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

On December 31, 2002, we had net rent and interest receivables due from Centennial and the third party
lessees of three facilities managed by Centennial of approximately $4.3 million. Letters of credit aggregating $4.4 million securing rent and loan payments due from Centennial were collected on January 2, 2003.

The total obligations of Centennial and the third party
lessees under the 20 leases and the loan are approximately $900,000 per month. Our gross investment in the 20 leased facilities and the facility subject to the secured loan was approximately $67 million and the current book value, net of
depreciation, is approximately $42 million at December 31, 2002.

We are in the process of transferring operations of ten facilities operated by Centennial to our existing lessees. Operations of nine other facilities may remain with Centennial and the remaining four facilities will go to new
lessees. We now anticipate that initial monthly payments under new leases will be approximately 50%, of the current required monthly payments under the existing leases.

Sun Healthcare

Sun Healthcare did not pay February 2003 rent and requested that we terminate the leases for four facilities
leased directly from us. Annual rent on the four facilities aggregated $2,400,000 in 2002. We are actively negotiating terms with replacement operators for these facilities. At year end, Sun operated five other facilities through sub-leases and
management contracts and our annual rental income on those five facilities for 2002 was approximately $3,200,000. Three of these five properties are now operated by a third party. We preliminarily estimate that fair market annual rents are
$1,000,000, less than rents on the six facilities operated by Sun. The current book value of the nine facilities, net of depreciation, was approximately $27 million at December 31, 2002.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward Looking Statements

Statements in this Annual Report that are not historical factual statements are “forward looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements include, among other things, statements regarding the intent, belief or expectations of


HCPI and its officers and can
be identified by the use of terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “should” and other comparable terms or the negative
thereof. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while forward looking
statements reflect our good faith belief and best judgment based upon current information, they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the
expectations contained in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors. In addition to the factors set forth under the caption Risk Factors in this Annual Report, readers should consider the following:

(a)

Legislative, regulatory, or other changes in the health care industry at the local, state or federal level which increase the costs of or otherwise affect the
operations of our lessees;

(b)

Changes in the reimbursement available to our lessees and mortgagors by governmental or private payors, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment levels
and the availability and cost of third party insurance coverage;

(c)

Competition for lessees and mortgagors, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases;

(d)

Availability of suitable health care facilities to acquire at a favorable cost of capital and the competition for such acquisition and financing of health care
facilities;

(e)

The ability of our lessees and mortgagors to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase revenues and to generate sufficient income to
make rent and loan payments;

(f)

The financial weakness of operators in the long-term care and assisted living sectors, including the bankruptcies of certain of our tenants, which results in
uncertainties in our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators’ leases;

(g)

Changes in national or regional economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital; and

(h)

The risk that we will not be able to sell or lease facilities that are currently vacant.

Item 7a. DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our investments are financed by the sale of common and preferred stock, long-term and medium-term debt,
internally generated cash flows, and some short-term bank debt.

We generally have fixed base rent on our leases; in addition, there can be additional rent based on a percentage of increased revenue over specified base period revenue of the properties and/or increases based on inflation indices or
other factors. Financing costs are comprised of dividends on preferred and common stock, fixed interest on long-term and medium-term debt and short-term interest on bank debt.

On a more limited basis, we have provided mortgage loans to operators of health care facilities in the normal
course of business. All of the mortgage loans receivable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with periodic fixed increases. Therefore, the mortgage loans receivable are all considered to be fixed rate loans, and the current interest rate
(the lowest rate) is used in the computation of market risk provided in the following table if material.


We may assume
existing mortgage notes payable as part of an acquisition transaction. Currently we have two mortgage notes payable with variable interest rates and the remaining mortgage notes payable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with fixed periodic
increases. Our Senior Notes are at fixed rates with one exception for a $25,000,000 variable rate senior note for which management has fixed the interest rate by means of a swap contract. The variable rate loans are at interest rates below the
current prime rate of 4.25%, and fluctuations are tied to the prime rate or to a rate currently below the prime rate.

At December 31, 2002, we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $4,290,000 of variable rate mortgage
notes payable and $267,800,000 of variable rate bank debt out of our portfolio of real estate of $3,120,000,000.

Fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt
matures and must be replaced or refinanced. Interest rate changes will affect the fair value of the fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not affect
the fair value on those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt including the mortgage notes payable and the bank lines of credit, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance
as of year end, interest expense for 2002 would increase by approximately $2,721,000, or $0.05 per common share on a diluted basis.

The principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by the final maturity dates is
presented in the following table. The fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans. The fair market value estimates for debt securities are
based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity.

Readers
are cautioned that most of the statements contained in the “Disclosures about Market Risk” paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures under the heading “Cautionary Language Regarding Forward
Looking Statements” previously set forth.


New Pronouncements

See Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.141 “Business Combinations,” No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” and No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”.

In April 2002, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 145 “Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections” (Statement 145), effective with fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. These rescinded Statements primarily relate to the extinguishment of debt
and lease accounting. In June 2002, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” effective with fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2002 with
early application encouraged. In October 2002, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 147 “Acquisition of Certain Financial Institutions” which is an amendment of FASB Statements No. 72 and 144 and FASB
Interpretation No. 9 (effective for acquisitions on or after October 1, 2002). In December 2002, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” an Amendment of FASB Statement

Item 14. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures
with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

Within 90 days prior to the date of this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date we completed our evaluation.

Exhibits:





*  Management Contract or Compensatory Plan or Arrangement.


For the
purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be incorporated by reference into
registrant’s Registration Statement on Form S-8 No.s 33-28483 and 333-90353 filed May 11, 1989 and November 5, 1999, respectively, and Form S-8 No.s 333-54786 and 333-54784 each filed February 1, 2001.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of
expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy
expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13
or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

of Directors

Health Care Property Investors, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Health Care
Property Investors, Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) THE COMPANY

Health Care Property Investors, Inc., a
Maryland corporation, was organized in March 1985 to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and its affiliated subsidiaries and partnerships (HCPI) were organized to invest in health care related
properties located throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2002, we own or have investments in 463 properties located in 43 states. The properties include 184 long-term care facilities, 101 assisted living facilities, 90 medical office
buildings (MOBs), 35 physician group practice clinics, 22 acute care hospitals, 14 retirement living communities, nine freestanding rehabilitation hospitals and eight health care laboratory and biotech research facilities. As of December 31, 2002,
we provided mortgage loans on or leased these properties to 96 health care operators and to approximately 650 tenants in the managed portfolio (defined in the following text).

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Rental And Interest Income:

Rental Income includes base and additional rental income. Additional rental income is generated by a percentage of increased revenue over
specified base period revenue of the properties and/or increases based on inflation indices or other factors.

We have certain leases and mortgages that have contractual fixed increases in rents and interest. We record straight-line rents and
interest in cases where we believe such rents and interest are sustainable.

During 2000, we adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101) “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” Under SAB 101, we are required
to defer income recognition of additional rents that are based on facility revenue increases until an annual (rather than quarterly) contractual facility revenue hurdle is exceeded. Due to our current lease structures, SAB 101 will delay the
recognition of certain additional rents from the first quarter of a year to subsequent quarters of the year. We previously followed the practice of estimating and applying rents ratably throughout each of the quarters. SAB 101 had no impact on our
results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 and had a minor impact in reducing income by $300,000 in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Managed Property Operations:

We have ownership interests in 67 MOBs, 26 physician group
practice clinics, 8 health care laboratory and biotech research facilities and one surgery center which are managed by independent property management companies on our behalf. These facilities are leased to multiple tenants under gross, modified
gross or triple net leases. Rental income is recorded under Rental Income, Managed Properties in our financial statements. Expenses related to the operation of these facilities are recorded as Managed Properties Operating Expenses.

F-7

Real Estate:

We record the acquisition of real estate at
cost and use the straight-line method of depreciation for buildings and improvements over estimated useful lives ranging up to 45 years. We periodically evaluate our investments in real estate for potential impairment by comparing our investment to
the expected future cash flows to be generated from the properties. If such impairments were to occur, we would write-down our investment in the property to estimated fair value. In addition, certain of our investments are in the process of being
sold. In instances where the expected sales price is projected to be less than the net investment we will write-down our investment in the property to fair value. Acquisition, development and construction arrangements are accounted for as real
estate investments/joint ventures or loans based on the characteristics of the arrangements.

Investments In Consolidated Subsidiaries And Partnerships:

We consolidate the accounts of our subsidiaries and certain general and limited partnerships which are majority owned and controlled. All
significant intercompany investments, accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Investments In And Advances To Joint Ventures:

We have investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures (see Note 6 following) in which we may serve as the general partner or managing member. However, since the other members in these
joint ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition, sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets, we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting. The accounting policies
of these joint ventures are substantially consistent with those of HCPI.

Federal Income Taxes:

We have operated at all times so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. As such, we are not taxed on our income that is distributed to stockholders. At December 31, 2002, the
tax basis of our net assets and liabilities is less than the reported amounts by approximately $280,000,000. The majority of this difference is attributable to the merger of American Health Properties, Inc. in 1999, wherein, for reporting purposes
the assets are recordable at fair market value while tax bases remain at historical cost. Additional variances are caused by accelerated depreciation for tax assets and differences in tax basis value versus fair market value in three limited
liability companies which are consolidated (and where we are the managing member).

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, differ from net income for financial statements due to the treatment required under the Internal Revenue Code of
certain interest income and expense items, depreciable lives, bases of assets and timing of rental income.

F-8

Discontinued Operations:

We have reclassified certain
facilities’ operations as Discontinued Operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (Statement 144) which was issued in August 2001.
Statement 144 established accounting and reporting standards requiring that long-lived assets to be disposed of be reported as Discontinued Operations if management has committed to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms within one
year. See Note 4 for the impact of Statement 144 on previously reported periods.

Stock Options:

As of
January 1, 2002, we commenced recognizing compensation expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” (Statement 123). The implementation of Statement 123 is
prospective and therefore 2001 operating results have not been impacted. We use the Black Scholes model for calculating stock option expense. This model requires us to make certain estimates including stock volatility, discount rate and the
termination discount factor. If we incorrectly estimate these variables, our results of operations could be affected.

Derivatives And Hedging:

During 1999, we entered into a $25,000,000 swap contract through which the variable interest rate on a senior note is fixed until its
February 2004 maturity. We have reflected the unrealized loss on the swap contract based on the change in fair market value of $164,000 and $1,140,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 as an accumulated other comprehensive loss (see
Note 12), which is recorded under Other Equity on the face of the balance sheet. If the note is held to maturity, the unrealized loss will not be incurred.

Accounting and reporting standards require that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Additionally, changes in the derivative’s fair value are recognized as other comprehensive income if specific hedge accounting criteria are
met. If these criteria are not met, changes in the fair value are to be included in earnings.

Cash And Cash Equivalents:

Investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.

Use Of Estimates In The Preparation Of Financial Statements:

Management is required to make estimates and assumptions in
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-9

Reclassification:

Reclassifications have been made for
comparative financial statement presentation.

(3) REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENTS

The Company was organized to
make long-term, equity-oriented investments principally in operating, income-producing health care related properties.

Leases:

Under the terms of our triple net lease agreements, we earn fixed monthly base rental income and may earn periodic additional rental
income. At December 31, 2002, minimum future rental income from 384 properties with non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:

(1)

Total Non-Cancelable Lease Revenues subject to purchase option in the year shown. The 2003 amount includes $6,397 of non-cancelable lease revenues from all
facilities in which a purchase option was available in the prior years, was not exercised and remains available to exercise and for which revenue would not be recognized if the option was exercised.

(2)

The 2004 and 2005 amounts are impacted by eight hospitals leased to Tenet Healthcare Corporation that come up for renewal or purchase option in either 2004 or 2005.
Six of the leases were renewed in 1999 for a five year term. Non-cancelable lease revenues of $43,061 and $9,231 for 2004 and 2005, respectively, relate to these eight hospitals.

Purchase options are generally at fair value and at an amount
in excess of the original purchase price.

Investments:

During the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001, we completed the following investment activity:

F-10

The
$232,500,000 in acquisitions was comprised of 29 properties, including 11 skilled nursing facilities, seven congregate care and assisted living facilities, five health and wellness centers, two retirement living communities, three medical office
buildings and one health care laboratory and biotech research facility. See Note 6 for details on our $125,000,000 investment in American Retirement Corporation (ARC).

The $190,000,000 in 2001 in acquisitions was comprised of 27 properties, including eight skilled nursing
facilities, eight medical office buildings, five health care laboratory and biotech research facilities and six congregate care assisted living facilities. Facilities under construction include a $28,000,000 short stay hospital and medical office
building and a $12,300,000 health care laboratory and biotech research facility. At December 31, 2001, we had funded $10,800,000 for construction of these facilities.

In September 2001, we invested $10,000,000 in a participation to fund three loans each secured by an assisted
living facility. One facility was sold in November 2001 and $7,400,000 of our initial investment was repaid to us.

F-11

The following
tabulation lists our total real estate investments and related mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2002 (Dollar amounts in thousands):

F-13

(4) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Statement 144 requires that the operating results generated on long-lived assets to be disposed of be
reclassified as Discontinued Operations. The reclassification has no impact on Net Income, FFO or per share amounts.

When we have committed to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms within one year of establishing the plan to sell, the
financial results for all periods presented are reclassified as Discontinued Operations. The following illustrates the net reclassification impact of Statement 144 on previously issued financial statements as a result of classifying facilities as
Discontinued Operations during 2002.

Increase/(Decrease) in Income From Operations from amounts previously stated:

For the
year ended December 31, 2002, we had 13 facilities classified as Discontinued Operations. Included in Discontinued Operations is operating income from these 13 facilities of $1,332,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Of these 13 facilities,
seven have been sold and six with a net book value of $7,900,000 had not yet been sold as of December 31, 2002.

(5) OPERATORS (unaudited)

Major Operators:

Listed below are our major operators which represent three percent or more of our revenue, the investment in properties operated by those operators, and the percentage of total revenue from these operators for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. All of the companies listed below are publicly traded companies and are subject to the informational filing requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and accordingly file periodic
financial statements on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

F-14

* Less
than 1%

Tenet

Tenet Healthcare Corporation (“Tenet”) leases eight
acute care hospitals and one medical office building in which we have an investment of $460,000,000. Rents from these hospitals accounted for approximately 16.1% of our 2002 revenue. According to news reports, the U.S. Department of Justice recently
filed a lawsuit against Tenet for allegedly submitting fraudulent claims to Medicare. The lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of triple damages and civil penalties under the False Claims Act.

Centennial

In early December 2002, we sent default and lease termination
notices to Centennial Healthcare Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (“Centennial”) for non-payment of rent under 17 leases and non-payment of interest and principal under a secured loan, and to a third party lessee for non-payment
on three facilities managed by Centennial. In December 2002, Centennial filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

On December 31, 2002, we had net rent and interest receivables due from Centennial and the third party lessees of three facilities managed
by Centennial of approximately $4.3 million. Letters of credit aggregating $4.4 million securing rent and loan payments due from Centennial were collected on January 2, 2003.

The total obligations of Centennial and the third party lessees under the 20 leases and the loan are
approximately $900,000 per month. Our gross investment in the 20 leased facilities and the facility subject to the secured loan was approximately $67 million and the current book value, net of depreciation, is approximately $42 million at December
31, 2002.

F-15

Troubled Long-Term Care and
Assisted Living Operators:

Approximately
25% of our annualized revenue is currently derived from the long-term care sector. Reduced reimbursements, a nursing shortage and increased liability insurance costs continue to plague the industry. Certain temporary Medicare add-on payments enacted
in The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 and Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefit and Protection Act of 2000 expired in October 2002. As a result, Medicare reimbursement to nursing homes declined about 9%, as of October 1, 2002. Other add on
payments associated with certain classifications are scheduled to expire October 1, 2003 unless Congress acts to restore the payments. A planned limitation on patient Medicare rehabilitation therapy procedures scheduled for January 1, 2003 has been
delayed until July 2003. The therapy cap may be further delayed. However, if the cap is enacted it is anticipated that Medicare reimbursement will be further reduced.

Due to economic challenges facing many states, nursing homes will likely continue to be under funded. Some
states, such as California, have proposed to reduce Medicaid reimbursement to nursing home providers. Management believes that inadequate Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and other issues discussed above will cause losses and reduced financial
performance for many long-term care facilities and operators.

Sun Healthcare did not pay February 2003 rent and requested that we terminate the leases for four facilities leased directly from us. Annual rent on the four facilities aggregated $2,400,000 in 2002. We are actively negotiating terms
with replacement operators for these facilities. At year end, Sun operated five other facilities through sub-leases and management contracts and our annual rental income on those five facilities for 2002 was approximately $3,200,000. Three of these
five properties are now operated by a third party. The current book value of the nine facilities, net of depreciation, is approximately $27 million at December 31, 2002.

We currently derive approximately 14% of our annualized revenue from the assisted living industry. This
sector has been challenged by overbuilding, slow fill-up, rising insurance costs and higher operating costs associated with increased acuity of residents. Occupancy rates and bottom line performance, including cash flow coverage on rents, are
improving. Various operators have continued to expand their portfolios through acquisitions of existing assisted living facilities during this past year, indicating a positive signal for the industry. More operators are reporting positive operating
cash flows for their portfolios while others are approaching this milestone.

We cannot assure you that the bankruptcies of certain long-term care operators and the trouble experienced by assisted living operators will not have a material adverse effect on our Net Income, FFO or
the market value of our common stock.

(6) INVESTMENTS
IN AND ADVANCES TO JOINT VENTURES AND ARC LOAN

We have an 80% interest in five joint ventures that lease six long-term care facilities and a 45%-50% interest in four joint ventures that each operate an assisted living facility. Since the other members in these joint
ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition, sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets, we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting.

F-16

Combined
summarized unaudited financial information of the joint ventures follows:

On
September 30, 2002 we completed a $125,000,000 total investment in subsidiaries of American Retirement Corporation (ARC). The total investment is comprised of a $112,750,000 five year loan to an ARC subsidiary and a separate 9.8% equity interest in
each of seven limited liability companies (ARC LLCs) for $12,250,000. Collectively, the limited liability companies own and lease nine retirement living communities. ARC holds the remaining 90.2% ownership interest. The loan is collateralized by
ARC’s ownership interest in the ARC LLCs.

Distributions of operating cash flow from each limited liability company are made monthly as follows: first, to us to cover any preferred distribution shortfalls from previous periods; second, to ARC to cover any preferred
distribution shortfalls from previous periods; third, to us equal to 9% annually on its equity interest in the limited liability companies; fourth, to ARC equal to 12% annually on its 90.2% ownership interest; and fifth, all remaining operating cash
flow with be distributed 5% to us and 95% to ARC.

The loan of $112,750,000 has an initial pay rate of 9% increasing annually by 55 basis points over the five-year loan term with a required payment at maturity to bring our return to 19.5%. The loan may be prepaid after three years
without penalty. In the event of default on the loan, we can foreclose on ARC’s ownership interest in the ARC LLCs. Based on management’s analysis of the loan to asset value underlying the investment, we are recording interest income at
approximately 13% at the present time. We regularly monitor the performance of the underlying retirement living communities that support the investment, and may make adjustments to the interest income recognition rate from time to time. As of
December 31, 2002, $1,200,000 of accrued interest receivable has been recorded, representing the difference between the accrual rate and the pay rate.

F-17

On September
30, 2007, we will have the option to purchase ARC’s 90.2% interest in the ARC LLCs for the greater of the fair market value, or an amount which yields a 19.5% internal rate of return to ARC.

Included in Other Partners’ Capital/(Deficit) above at
December 31, 2002 is $112,750,000 contributed by the ARC subsidiary to the ARC LLCs.

As of December 31, 2002, we have guaranteed approximately $6,800,000 million on notes payable obligations for four of these joint ventures.

(7) LOANS RECEIVABLE

The following is a summary of the Loans Receivable:

Total
Loans Receivable is Net of Reserves of 1,227,000 and 2,107,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

At December 31, 2002, minimum future principal payments from Loans Receivable are approximately $3,590,000 in 2003, $14,990,000 in 2004, $11,009,000 in 2005, $65,679,000 in 2006, $135,365,000 in 2007
and $69,532,000 in the aggregate thereafter.

F-18

The following
is a summary of Secured Loans Receivable at December 31, 2002:

F-19

(8) NOTES PAYABLE

Senior Notes Payable:

On June 25, 2002, we issued $250,000,000 of 6.45% coupon
Senior Notes due 2012. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in June and December.

The following is a summary of Senior Notes outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001:

The
weighted average interest rate on the Senior Notes was 7.08% and 7.24% for 2002 and 2001 and the weighted average balance of the Senior Note borrowings was approximately $796,701,000 and $774,892,000 during 2002 and 2001, respectively. Original
issue discounts are amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. The option payment relates to the unamortized portion of a put option associated with $200,000,000 principal amount of 6.875% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed Securities (MOPPRS) due June
8, 2015 which are subject to mandatory tender on June 8, 2005. The put option is being amortized to interest expense over 17 years. We may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the MOPPRS at face value on June 8, 2005. The interest rate on
any remaining MOPPRS from June 8, 2005 to the final maturity date will be reset to 5.565% plus an applicable spread. If held to maturity, the first required Senior Note maturities would be $31,000,000 in 2003, $92,000,000 in 2004, $231,000,000 in
2005, $135,000,000 in 2006, $140,000,000 in 2007 and $259,126,000 in the aggregate thereafter.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we paid off $124,579,000 of maturing long-term debt with an average interest rate of 7.20%.

F-20

Mortgage Notes Payable:

At December 31, 2002, we had a total of
$177,922,000 in Mortgage Notes Payable secured by 35 health care facilities with a net book value of approximately $309,734,000. Interest rates on the Mortgage Notes ranged from 2.78% to 10.63%. Required principal payments on the Mortgage Notes are
$12,232,000 in 2003, $13,587,000 in 2004, $16,102,000 in 2005, $7,567,000 in 2006, $4,302,000 in 2007 and $124,132,000 in the aggregate thereafter.

Bank Notes:

In October 2002, we closed on a new three year revolving line of credit totaling $490,000,000. The new line bears an annual facility fee
of 0.25%. The agreement provides for interest at the Prime Rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.875% or at a rate negotiated with each bank at the time of borrowing. An additional fee of 0.125% is paid on borrowings when borrowings
exceed 50% of the $490,000,000 capacity. Interest rates incurred by us ranged from 2.15% to 3.51% and 1.55% to 7.88% on maximum short-term bank borrowings of $309,800,000 and $204,500,000 for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The weighted average
interest rates were approximately 2.63% and 5.20% on weighted average short-term bank borrowings of $188,115,000 and $101,460,000 for the same respective periods.

(9) COMMITMENTS

We have commitments to acquire various facilities for $136,000,000. We have outstanding commitments to fund additional development of
facilities on existing properties of approximately $2,600,000 and are committed to fund $40,000,000 for construction of new health care facilities.

(10) COMMON STOCK

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we raised $84,290,000 at an average price per share of $39.54 under our Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP). Since implementation of the new DRIP in March 2001, $107,320,000 has been raised through the issuance of new common equity under the DRIP.

(11) PREFERRED STOCK

Preferred Stock is comprised of three series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock summarized as follows:

any other securities of HCPI. The carrying value of preferred stock approximates fair value.

(12) OTHER EQUITY

Other equity consists of the following:

Deferred
compensation is the value of incentive stock awards granted to employees and directors. See Note 17.

Other comprehensive loss is a reduction of net income in calculating comprehensive income. Comprehensive income is the change in equity
from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $137,216,000 and $120,026,000, respectively.

(13) OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS

As of December 31, 2002, there were a total of 1,678,512 non-managing member units outstanding in three limited liability companies in
which we are the managing member: HCPI/Utah, LLC, HCPI/Utah II, LLC and HCPI/Indiana, LLC. These non-managing member units are convertible into our common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we issued 126,250
non-managing member units of HCPI/Utah II, LLC as part of the acquisition of one medical office building and one health care laboratory and biotech research facility. In addition, during the year 124,487 non-managing member units were converted into
the same number of common shares.

(14) EARNINGS PER COMMON
SHARE

We compute earnings per share in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing Net Income applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share are calculated including the effect of dilutive securities. Approximately 1,000,000 options to purchase shares of common stock that had an exercise price in excess of the average
market price of the common stock during the period were not included because they are not dilutive.

(15) FUNDS FROM
OPERATIONS (Unaudited)

We are
required to report information about operations on the basis that we use internally to measure performance under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, effective
beginning in 1998.

We believe that Funds From
Operations (FFO) an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land) such
accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate
investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this problem.

We adopted the definition of FFO prescribed by the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). FFO is defined as Net Income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of
property, plus real estate depreciation and real estate related amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on
the same basis.

FFO does not represent cash
generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income. FFO, as defined by us,
may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define it exactly as the NAREIT definition.

Below are summaries of the calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (all amounts in thousands):

(16) DISCLOSURES ABOUT
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The carrying amount for Cash and Cash Equivalents approximates fair
value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments. Fair values for Secured Loans Receivable, Senior Notes and Mortgage Notes Payable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans and
instruments of comparable maturities, and are as follows:

(17) STOCK INCENTIVE
PLAN

Directors, officers and
key employees of ours are eligible to participate in our 2000 Stock Incentive Plans (Plan). A summary of the status of our Plan at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 and changes during the years then ended is presented in the following table and
narrative:

The
incentive stock awards (Awards) are granted at no cost to the employees or directors. The Awards generally vest and are amortized over five year periods (four years for directors). The stock options generally become exercisable on either a one year
or a five year schedule after the date of the grant.

F-24

The following
table describes the options outstanding as of December 31, 2002.

The fair
value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following ranges of assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 5.07% to 5.13%; expected dividend yields of 7.43% to 9.48%; expected
lives of 10 years; and expected volatility of .1894 to .1923.

As of January 1, 2002, we commenced recognizing compensation expense in accordance with Statement 123. Stock option expense represents the amount of amortized compensation costs related to 2002 stock options awarded to employees. The
charge of $308,000 has been included in General and Administrative Expense. Previously, we had accounted for all stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” which is
permitted under Statement 123. Had compensation expense for stock options been determined with rules set out in Statement 123 since its effective date, our Net Income and Basic Earnings Per Common Share would have been lower by approximately
$468,000 and $0.01 per basic share, $638,000 and $0.01 per basic share and $641,000 and $0.01 per basic share for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Loans secured by stock in HCPI to directors and officers total $2,259,000 and $2,429,000 at December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively, and are classified as other equity on the balance sheet. The interest rate charged is based on the prevailing applicable federal rate as of the inception of the loan and averaged 3.71% and 3.88% for the year ended December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(18) DIVIDENDS

Common stock dividend payment dates are
scheduled approximately 50 days following each calendar quarter. On January 27, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.83 per share paid on February 20, 2003 to stockholders of record on February 06, 2002.

In order to qualify as a REIT, we must generally, among other
requirements, distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders. HCPI and other REITs generally distribute 100% of taxable income to avoid taxes on the remaining 10% of taxable income.

F-25

Per share dividend payments made by HCPI to the stockholders were characterized in the
following manner for tax purposes:

Dividends on all series of preferred stock are paid on the last day of each quarter.
