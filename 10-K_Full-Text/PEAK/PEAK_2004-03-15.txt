PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

Business

Health Care Property Investors, Inc. (HCP), a Maryland corporation, was
organized in March 1985 to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT). We invest in health care related real estate located throughout the United States, including hospitals, long-term care facilities, assisted and retirement living
facilities, medical office buildings and other health care facilities. We commenced business nearly 19 years ago, making us the second oldest REIT specializing in health care real estate.

References herein to “HCP”, “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” include
Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures and partnerships, unless the context otherwise requires.

As of December 31, 2003, our total investment in our properties, including investments through joint ventures and mortgage loans, was approximately
$3.4 billion. Our portfolio of 554 properties in 44 states consisted of:

•

31 hospitals

•

173 long-term care facilities

•

124 assisted and retirement living facilities

•

196 medical office buildings

•

30 other health care facilities

You can access free of charge a copy of the periodic and current reports we file with the SEC on our website at www.hcpi.com. Our periodic and current
reports are made available on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with the SEC.

Business Strategy

We are organized to invest in income-producing health care related facilities. Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable
growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles — an opportunistic investing approach, portfolio diversification, and a conservative balance sheet.

Opportunistic Investing Approach

We complete real estate transactions when they are expected to drive profitable growth and create long-term stockholder
value. We attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of opportunities when we believe the opportunities meet our goals and investment criteria. We may invest in properties directly, through joint ventures, or provide secured
financing, depending on the dynamics of the investment opportunity.

Portfolio Diversification

We believe
in maintaining a diversified portfolio of heath care related real estate. Diversification within the health care industry reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business. This allows us to take advantage of
opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of attaining diversification in our portfolio, there are no limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one
property, joint venture, property type, geographic location or in the number of properties in which we seek to invest or lease to a single operator.

Conservative Balance Sheet

We believe a conservative balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute on our opportunistic investing approach and portfolio diversification
principles. We execute our conservative balance sheet strategy through managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity, such as under our line of credit. Additionally, our debt is primarily fixed rate which reduces
the impact of rising interest rates on our results of operations. Rising interest rates will not significantly impact our future earnings until our debt matures and must be repaid or refinanced.



We finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. We may incur
additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock when, in the opinion of our management and directors, it is advisable. For short-term purposes, we from time to time negotiate lines of credit, or arrange for other short-term borrowings
from banks or others. We arrange for long-term borrowings through public offerings or from institutional investors.

In addition, we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we have acquired through purchase, foreclosure or otherwise. Where properties
are encumbered by debt with terms deemed favorable, we will assume existing loans, mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on the properties. We also may obtain non-recourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have
invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis.

Competition

Our properties are subject to
competition from the properties of other health care providers. The operators of these competing properties may have capital resources substantially in excess of some of the operators of our facilities. In addition, the extent to which our
properties are utilized depends upon several factors, including the number of physicians using the health care facilities or referring patients to the facilities, competitive systems of health care delivery and the size and composition of the
population in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the utilization of the properties. Virtually all of the properties operate in a
competitive environment with patients and referral sources, including physicians, changing their preferences for a health care facility from time to time.

Investing in real estate is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment companies, lessees and other investors when we attempt to
acquire or sell properties. Increased competition reduces the number of opportunities that meet our investment criteria. If we do not identify investments that meet our investment criteria, our ability to increase shareholder value through
profitable growth may be limited.

2003 Developments

Property Transactions

•

We acquired 11 properties for an aggregate purchase price of $189,400,000 in 2003. These properties have an average annual lease rate of 9.7%, based on our cost of the properties.

We increased our common stock dividend to $1.66 per share in 2003 from $1.63 per share in 2002.

Our Properties

Portfolio Summary

Our portfolio of investments includes direct investments in health care related properties, joint ventures and mortgage loans. Our properties include
hospitals, long-term care facilities, assisted and retirement living facilities, medical office buildings and other health care facilities. As of December 31, 2003, our property investments, including those through joint ventures and mortgage loans,
consist of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):

(1)

Hospitals and long-term care facilities are measured by licensed bed count. Assisted and retirement living facilities are apartment-like facilities and are stated in units (studio,
one or two bedroom apartments). Medical office buildings and other health care facilities are measured in square feet.

(2)

Represents the historical cost of our real estate investments and the net book value of our unconsolidated joint ventures and secured loans receivable. Excludes assets to be sold
and classified as discontinued operations.

(3)

Since the tenant is responsible for operating expenses under a triple-net lease, management believes revenues are not comparable between property types without deducting our
operating expenses for properties leased under gross or modified gross leases.

Property Types

We have
investments in hospitals, long-term care facilities, assisted and retirement living facilities, medical office buildings and other health care facilities. The following describes the nature of the operations of our tenants and borrowers in those
investments.

Hospitals

. We have an interest in 31
general and long-term acute care and rehabilitation hospitals. General hospitals offer a wide range of services such as fully-equipped operating and recovery rooms, obstetrics, radiology, intensive care, open heart surgery and coronary care,
neurosurgery, neonatal intensive care, magnetic resonance imaging, nursing units, oncology, clinical laboratories, respiratory therapy, physical therapy, nuclear medicine, rehabilitation services and outpatient services. Long-term acute care
hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring, or emergency back-up than that available in most skilled nursing-based subacute programs. Services are paid for by private sources,
third party payors (e.g., insurance and HMOs), or through the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Medicare provides reimbursement incentives to traditional general acute care hospitals to minimize inpatient length of stay.

Rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients
who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses, such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, head injuries, orthopedic problems, work related disabilities and neurological



diseases, as well as treatment for amputees and patients with severe arthritis. Rehabilitation programs encompass physical, occupational, speech and
inhalation therapies, rehabilitative nursing and other specialties. Services are paid for by the patient or the patient’s family, third party payors (e.g., insurance and HMOs), or through the federal Medicare program.

Long-Term Care Facilities

. We have invested in 173 long-term care
facilities. Various health care providers operate these facilities. Long-term care facilities offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at
hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenue from subacute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology
treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain long-term care facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an out-patient basis. Long-term care facilities are
designed to supplement hospital care and depend to some degree upon referrals from practicing physicians and hospitals. Long-term care services are paid for either by private sources, or through the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.

Long-term care facilities generally provide patients with
accommodation, complete medical and nursing care, and rehabilitation services including speech, physical and occupational therapy. As a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981, Congress established a waiver program under
Medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional long-term care services. The provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990 allow states, with federal approval, greater flexibility in program design as a means of developing
cost-effective alternatives to delivering services traditionally provided in the long-term care setting. This was a contributing factor to the past increase in the number of assisted living facilities, which adversely affected some long-term care
facilities as some individuals chose the residential environment and lower cost delivery system provided in the assisted living setting.

Certain temporary Medicare add-on payments expired in October 2002 causing a decline in Medicare reimbursement to nursing homes of approximately 9% as of
October 1, 2002. However, the annual market basket increase to Medicare rates for long-term care facilities and a prospective payment correction took effect October 1, 2003, partially offsetting the forgoing, and resulting in an aggregate 6%
increase in Medicare rates. In addition, most state Medicaid rates were increased slightly providing further revenue and sector stabilization.

Assisted and Retirement Living Facilities

. We have investments in 110 assisted living facilities offering studio and one and two bedroom apartments
on a month-to-month basis primarily to individuals who are over 75 years of age with various levels of assistance requirements. More ambulatory residents are provided meals and eat in a central dining area; they may also be assisted with some daily
living activities with programs and services that allow residents certain conveniences and make it possible for them to live independently. Staff is also available when residents need assistance and for group activities. Services provided to
residents who require more assistance with daily living activities, but who do not require the constant supervision other long-term care facilities provide, include personal supervision and assistance with eating, bathing, grooming and administering
medication. Charges for room and board are generally paid from private sources.

We have investments in 14 retirement living communities. These communities are large, upscale residential communities in a congregate care and continuing care living setting combined with onsite amenities and
services. Residents are provided the comfort, security and convenience of residing within an aging in place environment, eliminating the need to seek other living accommodations or arrangement for appropriate levels of care. Ancillary and health
care services are available at those properties that provide nursing and assisted living care. The full continuum of senior living environment includes independent living apartments and cottages, assisted living and, in some communities, skilled
nursing and Alzheimer’s care. Various accommodation terms are available to residents, including monthly rentals, rental life care, fully refundable entrance fees, non-refundable endowments, cooperatives, and condominiums.

Medical Office Buildings

. We have investments in 196 medical office
buildings including a 33% ownership interest in 105 medical office buildings through our joint venture with GE. Many of these buildings are located adjacent to, or on the campus of, acute care hospitals. Medical office buildings contain
physicians’ offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and day-surgery operating rooms. Medical office buildings require more extensive plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling capabilities
than commercial office buildings for sinks, brighter lights, special equipment and biological waste mechanisms required for the proper operation of a medical office. Of our owned medical office buildings, 16 are leased on a single tenant triple net
basis while 75 are managed by third party property management companies and are leased under triple net, gross or modified gross leases under which we are responsible for certain operating expenses.

Other Health Care Facilities

. We have investments in eight health care
laboratory and biotech research facilities. These facilities are located on research campuses of major universities. The facilities are designed to accommodate research and development in the biopharmaceutical industry, drug discovery and
development, and predictive and personalized medicine.



We also have investments in 16 physician group practice clinic facilities that are leased to four
different tenants and investments in six health and wellness centers that are generally leased to a single tenant under a triple net or modified gross lease. The physician group practice clinics generally provide a broad range of medical services
through organized physician groups representing various medical specialties. Health and wellness centers provide testing and preventative health maintenance services.

Lease and Mortgage Loans

As of December 31, 2003, we leased 311 of our single tenant properties pursuant to long-term triple net leases to 89 health care providers. We leased 92
of these properties pursuant to gross or modified gross leases with multiple tenants. Under a triple net lease, in addition to the rent obligation, the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses of the property such as utilities, property
taxes, insurance and repairs and maintenance. Under gross or modified gross leases, we may be responsible for property taxes, repairs and maintenance and/or insurance on the properties.

Three hundred eleven of our properties are triple net leased to single tenant operators and 92 of our properties are managed
by independent property management companies on our behalf. The properties managed by independent property management companies are leased under triple net, gross, or modified gross leases with single or multiple tenants.

The initial annual base rental rates on our triple net leased portfolio of
properties that we acquired during the three years ended December 31, 2003 have generally ranged from 10% to 13% of the acquisition price of the related property. Initial interest rates on the loans we entered into as lender during the three years
ended December 31, 2003 have generally ranged from 13% to 19% per annum. Rental rates vary by lease, taking into consideration many factors, such as:

•

creditworthiness of the tenant;

•

operating performance of the facility;

•

interest rates at the beginning of the lease;

•

location, type and physical condition of the facility; and

•

lease term

Certain leases provide for additional rents that are based upon a percentage of the tenant’s revenue in excess of the revenue for a specific base period. Others have rent increases based on inflation indices or
other factors and some leases and loans have annual fixed rent or interest rate increases.

In addition to the minimum and additional rents, the tenant under a triple net lease is generally responsible for all additional charges, including charges related to non-payment or late payment of rent, property
taxes and assessments, governmental charges, and utility and other charges. Each triple net tenant is required, at its expense, to maintain its leased property in good order and repair. We are generally not required to repair, rebuild or maintain
the properties leased under triple net leases.

Each tenant
with a gross or modified gross lease is also responsible for minimum and additional rents, but may not be responsible for all normal operating expenses. Under gross or modified gross leases, we may be responsible for property taxes, repairs and
maintenance and/or insurance on those properties.

The primary
or fixed terms of the triple net and modified gross leases generally range from ten to 15 years, and generally have one or more five-year (or longer) renewal options. The weighted average remaining primary or fixed term on our triple net and
modified gross leases in our portfolio is approximately eight years. The primary or fixed term of our medical office buildings gross leases range from one to 15 years, with a weighted average of five years remaining on those leases.



We invested in mortgage loans secured by properties that are owned and operated by 13 health care
providers. Significant borrowers include ARC, Beverly and Emeritus. We have provided secured mortgage loans on these properties, including three hospitals, 17 long-term care facilities and 26 assisted and retirement living facilities. At December
31, 2003, the carrying value of these mortgage loans totaled $243,891,000.

The following reflects the annual impact by year in terms of 2003 Revenue Less Operating Expenses resulting from lease expirations and mortgage loan maturities (Dollar amounts in thousands):

(1)

Table excludes non-property specific revenue of $5,622 and equity income and acquisition and management fees earned from HCP MOP of $4,185.

(2)

Since the tenant is responsible for operating expenses under a triple-net lease, management believes revenues are not comparable between property types without deducting our
operating expenses for properties leased under gross or modified gross leases.

Certain of our properties are subject to purchase options with the tenant. The following table reflects future minimum lease payments to be received under non-cancelable leases subject to purchase options (Dollar
amounts in thousands):

Obligations under the
triple-net leases, in most cases, have corporate parent or shareholder guarantees. Irrevocable letters of credit from various financial institutions and lease deposits secure 136 leases and mortgage loans on 15 facilities and generally cover from
one to 12 months of lease or loan payments. We require the tenants and mortgagors to renew such letters of credit during the lease or loan term in amounts that may change based upon the passage of time, changes in operating cash flows or changes in
credit ratings.



Major Operators

The following table provides information about the major operators of our properties for the year ended December 31, 2003:

The above companies
are subject to the informational filing requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and accordingly file periodic financial statements on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial and other
information relating to these operators may be obtained from their public reports.

Tenet Healthcare Corporation

During the year
ended December 31, 2003, Tenet Healthcare Corporation (Tenet) leased eight acute care hospitals and one medical office building from us. Revenue from Tenet properties constituted approximately 16% of our 2003 Revenue Less Operating Expenses. One of
the hospital leases is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2005. Tenet can renew that lease for an additional five years by providing notice at least 180 days prior to lease expiration. Tenet exercised five-year extensions on six facility leases - five
with terms now set to expire in February 2009 and one now set to expire in May 2009. In October 2003, Tenet assigned the lease for a hospital located in Poplar Bluff, Missouri to Health Management Associates (HMA). HMA is a health care services
operator with hospitals concentrated primarily in the southeast and southwest areas of the United States. The lease on that hospital provided for rent of $3,700,000 for 2003 and has a lease term set to expire in February 2009. As of December 31,
2003, we have an investment of $423,773,000 in the remaining seven facilities leased to Tenet.

One of our hospitals located in Tarzana, California, and operated by Tenet under a lease expiring in February 2009 is affected by State of California Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), which requires certain seismic safety
building standards for acute care hospital facilities. We are currently reviewing, along with Tenet, the SB 1953 compliance of this hospital, multiple plans of action to cause such compliance, the estimated time for completing the same and the cost
of performing necessary remediation of the property. We cannot currently estimate the potential costs of SB 1953 compliance with respect to the affected hospital or the final allocation of such costs between Tenet and us. Rent on the hospital in
2003 was $10.8 million and the net book value is $81 million.

Tenet announced its adoption of new policies, as of January 1, 2003, for calculating Medicare reimbursement for patients who require high cost treatments (outlier payments) which has led to reduced revenues at certain of its hospitals. Cash
flow coverage of rents for the Tenet hospitals was 4.3 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2003. This is down from a coverage level of 5.1 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2002.

According to public disclosures by Tenet, Tenet is undergoing an
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to its billing practices and financial disclosures; the United States Department of Justice is suing Tenet over Medicare fraud allegations; the U.S. Attorney’s office is
investigating Tenet’s use on physician relocation agreements, certain contractual matters related to physicians and others and Medicare outlier payments; a federal grand jury has returned an indictment accusing a subsidiary of Tenet of illegal
use of physician relocation agreements; the Internal Revenue Service has assessed a $157 million tax deficiency with interest of $118 million as of September 30, 2003 against Tenet; the United States Senate Finance Committee is investigating
Tenet’s corporate governance practices with respect to federal health care programs; Tenet is litigating several federal securities class action and shareholder derivative suits and several state law actions; Tenet is litigating a

qui
tam

action in Florida regarding alleged illegal kickbacks; the United States Department of Health and Human Services is investigating Tenet’s relationship with the Women’s Cancer Center; a former executive of Tenet received a $148
million judgment against Tenet for certain stock incentive awards; and Tenet is subject to other federal and state investigations regarding its business practices. Tenet is responding to a Justice Department subpoena regarding the outlier payments
at the Company’s Tarzana facility.



On March 9, 2004, Tenet announced that it amended its Bank Credit Agreement which reduced the aggregate
commitments available under the Revolving Credit Facility, including funded loans and letters of credit, from $1,200,000,000 to $800,000,000 with a limit on funded loans of $500,000,000 and letters of credit of $300,000,000. Tenet also announced
that currently there are no funded loans and $215,000,000 of letters of credit are outstanding.

We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these recent developments may have on individual hospital performances and the related lease payments due to us
by Tenet. The failure or inability of Tenet to pay its obligations to us could materially reduce our revenues and net income, which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline.

HealthSouth Corporation

During 2003, 5% of our 2003 Revenue Less Operating Expenses was generated
from facilities leased to HealthSouth Corporation (HealthSouth), primarily from nine rehabilitation hospitals. In March 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged HealthSouth and its former chief executive officer with inflating earnings
and overstating assets and as a result HealthSouth has announced that its previous financial statements should not be relied upon. HealthSouth has announced that it is undergoing a financial audit and forensic examination to assess the accuracy of
its financial information. In October 2003, HealthSouth announced that it paid its semi-annual interest payments to bondholders and announced its intention to remain current on all interest payments. On January 16, 2004, HealthSouth announced the
refinancing of a Subordinated Debt Issue and that it is now current on all of its outstanding principal and interest payments due under HealthSouth’s various borrowing agreements. The nine rehabilitation hospitals leased by HealthSouth have an
average remaining lease term of four years not taking into account renewal options. The average age of these hospitals is 14 years. Fourth quarter 2003 occupancy for the nine facilities, as provided by HealthSouth, ranged from 58% to 99%, with an
average occupancy of 75%. HealthSouth is current on rent payments through March 2004.

Lake Seminole Square Real Estate Holdings, LLC; and ARC Brandywine Real Estate Holdings, LLC) which own a total of five retirement living communities.

Taxation of HCP

We believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1985, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. No assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as
to qualify or to remain so qualified. This summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof.

If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be required to
pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally
results from investment in a corporation. However, we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances.

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association (i) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (ii) the beneficial ownership of
which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) which would be taxable, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as a domestic corporation; (iv) which is neither a financial institution
nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; (vi) during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is
owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals; and (vii) which meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets. The Code provides that conditions (i) to
(iv), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (v) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months.

There presently are two gross income requirements. First, at least 75% of our
gross income (excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” as defined below) for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain
types of temporary investment income. Second, at least



95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75%
test and all other dividends, interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities. A “prohibited transaction” is a sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property) to be sold to customers in
the ordinary course of business.

At the close of each quarter
of our taxable year, we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds
of a stock offering or long term public debt offering by us (but only for the one year period after such offering), cash, cash items and government securities. Second, not more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities other than
those in the 75% asset class. Third, of the investments included in the 25% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10% of the vote or
value of the securities of a non-REIT corporation, other than certain debt securities and interests in taxable REIT subsidiaries, as defined below. Fourth, not more than 20% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or
more taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We own interests in various
partnerships and limited liability companies. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the Code, Treasury Regulations provide that for purposes of the
REIT income and asset tests, the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership or limited liability company
attributable to such share. The ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a REIT may involve special tax risks, including the challenge by the Internal Revenue Service (the “Service”) of the allocations of
income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company, which would affect the computation of taxable income of the REIT, and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership (as opposed to an association
taxable as a corporation) for federal income tax purposes. We also own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries (each a “QRS”). The Code provides that such subsidiaries will be
ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as assets, liabilities and such items of ours. If any partnership, limited liability company, or
subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation (and not as a partnership, QRS or taxable REIT subsidiary) for federal income tax purposes, we would likely fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests described above and would
therefore fail to qualify as a REIT. We believe that each of the partnerships, limited liability companies, and subsidiaries (other than taxable REIT subsidiaries) in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership or
disregarded entity (in the case of a 100% owned partnership or limited liability company), or QRS, respectively, although no assurance can be given that the Service will not successfully challenge the status of any such organization.

We also own interests in two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as
taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a “TRS”). A REIT may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the REIT to be a TRS, provided certain requirements are met. A TRS generally
may engage in any business, including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent REIT and of others, except a TRS may not manage or operate a hotel or health care facility. A TRS is treated as a regular corporation
and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates. In addition, a 100% tax may be imposed on a REIT if its rental, service or other agreements with its TRS, or the TRS’s agreements
with the REITs tenants, are not on arms’ length terms.

In
order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our “real estate investment trust taxable income”
(computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net income, if any (after tax), from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. Such distributions must be paid
in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year, if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and
specify the dollar amount in our tax return. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net long-term capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “real estate investment trust taxable income”, as adjusted,
we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates. Furthermore, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our capital gain income for
such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be required to pay a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed.

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and certain
relief provisions do not apply, we will be required to pay tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be
deductible by us nor will they be required to be made. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was
lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to



stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness (to the extent borrowings are feasible) or liquidating substantial investments in
order to pay the resulting taxes.

We and our stockholders may
be required to pay state or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we or they transact business or reside. The state and local tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax
consequences discussed above.

Government Regulation

The health care industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local
laws. This government regulation of the health care industry affects us because:

(1)

The financial ability of tenants and mortgagors to make rent and debt payments to us may be affected by governmental regulations such as licensure, certification for participation
in government programs, and government reimbursement, and

(2)

Our additional rents are often based on our tenants’ gross revenue from operations, which in turn are affected by the amount of reimbursement such tenants receive from the
government.

These laws and regulations are
subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. These changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or
impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third-party payors. These changes may be applied retroactively. The ultimate timing or effect of these changes
cannot be predicted. The failure of any tenant or borrower to comply with such laws, regulations and requirements could affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such tenant’s or borrower’s ability
to make debt or lease payments to us.

Fraud and Abuse
Laws

. There are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud and abusive business practices by health care providers who participate in, receive payments from or are in a position to make referrals in connection with a government-sponsored
health care program, including, but not limited to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These include:

•

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the
referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients.

•

The Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition (Stark), which restricts physicians who have financial relationships with health care providers from making referrals for certain
designated health services for which payment may be made under Medicare or Medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship.

•

The False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs).

•

The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which is imposed by the Department of Health and Human Services for fraudulent acts.

Each of these laws include criminal and/or civil penalties for violations
that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Imposition of any of these types of penalties on our tenants or
borrowers could result in a material adverse effect on their operations, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, certain laws, such as the False Claims Act, allow for individuals to bring

qui tam

(or whistleblower) actions on
behalf of the government for violations of fraud and abuse laws. Some Medicare fiscal intermediaries (private companies that contract with CMS to administer the Medicare program) have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by long-term care
providers.

Many states have adopted or are considering
legislative proposals similar to these fraud and abuse laws. Further, under Operation Restore Trust, a major anti-fraud demonstration project, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in cooperation with
other federal and state agencies, has focused on the activities of skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospices and durable medical equipment suppliers in certain states, including California, in which we have properties. Due to the
success of Operation Restore Trust, the project has been expanded to numerous other states and to additional providers, including providers of ancillary nursing home services.



In December of 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the
“Act”) was signed into law. The Act established an 18-month moratorium on the “whole hospital exception” to the Stark law, whereby physicians have been permitted to refer patients for Designated Health Services to hospitals in
which they have an ownership interest. The moratorium removes specialty hospitals from the “whole hospital exception.” Specialty hospitals include hospitals primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of cardiac conditions
or orthopedic conditions, or hospitals that perform certain surgical procedures. Specialty hospitals in operation or under development as of November 18, 2003 are grandfathered under the moratorium. The Act requires that MedPAC, an independent
federal body established to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program, and HHS conduct studies on the costs of service, utilization, quality of care and financial impact of specialty hospitals and their physician owners relative to
community hospitals, particularly nonprofits. These studies may result in legislation extending the moratorium or further restricting hospital ownership by physicians.

We have no knowledge that would lead us to believe that any of the other facilities in which we have investments are not in
substantial compliance with the various regulatory requirements applicable to them, although there can be no assurance that the operators are in compliance or will remain in compliance in the future.

Licensure Risks

. Most health care facilities must obtain a license
from the state in which they operate. Failure to obtain licensure or loss of licensure would prevent a facility from providing health care services on the premises. These events could adversely affect the facility operator’s ability to make
rent and debt payments. State and local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and occasionally the contraction of health care facilities by requiring certificate of need
or other similar approval programs.

Environmental
Matters

. A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender (such as us) may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential
costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or
secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may
adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, would reduce our revenue.

Although the mortgage loans that we provide and leases covering our properties require the borrower and the tenant to indemnify us for certain
environmental liabilities, the scope of such obligations may be limited and we cannot assure that any such borrower or tenant would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations.

The Federal Medicare and Medicaid Programs

. Sources of revenue for tenants and mortgagors may include the federal
Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health care service plans and health maintenance organizations, among others. Efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower
growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators. In addition, the failure of any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and their ability to continue to
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

State
Medicaid Programs.

Medicaid programs differ from state to state but they are all subject to federally-imposed requirements. At least 50% of the funds available under these programs is provided by the federal government under a matching program.
Medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates; long-term care facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates. Medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for
tenant-operated facilities. Increasingly, states have introduced managed care contracting techniques in the administration of Medicaid programs. Such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement to facilities. Other
third party payors in various states and areas base payments on costs, retail rates or, increasingly, negotiated rates. Negotiated rates can include discounts from normal charges, fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates.

Entrance Fee Communities

. Certain of the facilities mortgaged to or
owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident in exchange for some form of long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant
state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility’s financial condition, establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel their contracts within
a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters. Such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or
operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely impact us.



Health Care Facilities.

The health care facilities in our portfolio, including long-term care
facilities, acute care hospitals, assisted living facilities, physician group practice clinics and rehabilitation hospitals, are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations. Failure to
comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such actions
may have an effect on the revenue of the operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely impact us.

Senate Bill 1953.

California hospitals are subject to State Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), which requires certain seismic safety building standards
for acute care hospital facilities. A hospital located in Tarzana, California, and leased by Tenet is affected by SB 1953. As a result, we and Tenet are evaluating the effects of compliance with SB 1953, including the costs of remediation, time for
completion, structural and financial feasibility of repairs. We cannot currently estimate the potential costs of SB 1953 compliance on this hospital or the final allocation of costs with respect to us and our tenants.

Nurse-Staffing Ratios

. On January 1, 2004, a California law became
effective mandating specific minimum nurse staffing ratios for acute care hospitals. As a result of this requirement, hospital labor costs will be materially increased. Facilities may also be forced to limit patient admissions due to an inability to
hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratio, which affects net operating revenue. It is unclear the extent to which compliance with these nurse staffing ratios in California may adversely affect hospital operators in California.

Health Care Reform

The health care industry continues to face various challenges, including
increased government and private payor pressure on health care providers to control costs, the migration of patients from acute care facilities into extended care and home care settings, and the vertical and horizontal consolidation of health care
providers.

Changes in the law, new interpretations of existing
laws, and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by both government and
other third-party payors. These changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances. The ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
(the “Act”) was signed into law on December 8, 2003. The law provides, among other things, prescription drug benefits for the elderly and individuals with disabilities through subsidies and discounts, and establishes drug payment
methodologies and drug reimportation requirements. As discussed above, the Act affects the “whole hospital exception” to the Stark law. The Act also makes significant changes to payment provisions under Medicare Parts A and B and Medicaid.
Hospitals may experience an increase in revenue due to expanded opportunities for wage index reclassifications, expanded coverage of device trials, reduction in thresholds to qualify for the new technology add-on payment, inpatient prospective
payment systems updates, and other provisions. Critical access hospitals, rural referral centers, low-volume hospitals and disproportionate share hospitals in particular will receive increased payments and adjustments under the Act. However, certain
outpatient drug reimbursements to hospitals may be reduced. We cannot predict how our operators will fare under the Act until implementing regulations are issued to provide further guidance. Interim final regulations for certain provisions became
effective on January 1, 2004, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services set implementation dates for many provisions in 2004.

In addition to the reforms enacted and considered by Congress from time to time, state legislatures periodically consider various health care reform
proposals. Congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems, new regulatory enforcement initiatives, and new payment methodologies.

We believe that government and private efforts to contain or reduce health
care costs will continue. These trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and mortgagors. We believe that the vast nature of the health care industry, the financial
strength and operating flexibility of our operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any such diminution in reimbursements. However, we cannot predict what legislation will be adopted, and no assurance can be given that
the health care reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.



Legal Entities

We conduct our business through various legal entities, including the following at December 31, 2003:

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below
as well as the risks described in “Government Regulation” and “Health Care Reform” and elsewhere in this report before making an investment decision in our company. The risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only
ones facing us and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely to have a significant impact. All of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

If our tenants and mortgagors are unable to
operate our properties in a manner sufficient to generate income, they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us.

The health care industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future. Our tenants and mortgagors are subject to
competition from other health care providers that provide similar health care services, which competition has been intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we operate causing a slow-down in the fill-rate of newly constructed
buildings and a reduction in the monthly rate many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services. The profitability of health care facilities depends upon several factors, including the number of physicians
using the health care facilities or referring patients there, competitive systems of health care delivery and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other
laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the revenues and income of the properties. If our tenants and mortgagors are not competitive with other health care providers and are unable to generate income, they may be unable to make
rent and loan payments to us.

Decline in the assisted living sector may
have significant adverse consequences to us.

The assisted
living industry has been challenged by overbuilding, slow fill-up rates, rising insurance costs and higher operating costs associated with increased acuity of residents. These challenges have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse
effect on our assisted living facilities and facility operators.



Decline in the long-term care sector may have significant adverse consequences to us.

Certain of our long-term care operators and facilities continue to
experience operating problems in part due to a national nursing shortage, increased liability insurance costs, and low levels of Medicaid reimbursement in certain states. Due to economic challenges facing many states, nursing homes will likely
continue to be under-funded. Some states, such as California, have proposed to reduce Medicaid reimbursement to nursing home providers. These challenges have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on our long-term care
facilities and facility operators.

If we are unable to purchase suitable
health care facilities at a favorable cost of capital, we will be unable to continue to grow.

The acquisition and financing of health care facilities at favorable costs is highly competitive. As a result of REITs being required to make dividend
distributions and, thus, retain little capital for growth, we can only grow through the steady investment of new capital into real estate assets. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of health care facilities at favorable prices,
or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business will suffer.

Unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability.

Our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions. The acquisitions we make may not prove to be successful. We might encounter unanticipated
difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities. Further, newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We might
never realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our profitability.

The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our facility operators could significantly delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new operators.

Our financial position and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any of our major operators, including bankruptcy, insolvency or a general downturn in the business, or in the event any of our major operators do not renew or extend
their relationship with us as their lease terms expire.

We are
exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations, which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency. Although our leases and loans provide us the right to terminate an investment, evict an operator, demand immediate
repayment and other remedies, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rents or interest during the
bankruptcy proceeding.

Tenet Healthcare Corporation accounts for 16% of our
Revenues Less Operating Expenses and is currently under investigation by several governmental entities.

During 2003, Tenet Healthcare Corporation accounted for 16% of our Revenues Less Operating Expenses. According to public disclosures by Tenet, Tenet is
undergoing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to its billing practices and financial disclosures; the United States Department of Justice is suing Tenet over Medicare fraud allegations; the U.S. Attorney’s
office is investigating Tenet’s use of physician relocation agreements, certain contractual matters related to physicians and others and Medicare outlier payments; a federal grand jury has returned an indictment accusing a subsidiary of Tenet
of illegal use of physician relocation agreements; the Internal Revenue Service has assessed a $157 million tax deficiency with interest of $118 million as of September 30, 2003 against Tenet; the United States Senate Finance Committee is
investigating Tenet’s corporate governance practices with respect to federal health care programs; Tenet is litigating several federal securities class action and shareholder derivative suits and several state law actions; Tenet is litigating a

qui tam

action in Florida regarding alleged illegal kickbacks; the United States Department of Health and Human Services is investigating Tenet’s relationship with the Women’s Cancer Center; a former executive of Tenet received a
$148 million judgment against Tenet for certain stock incentive awards; and Tenet is subject to other federal and state investigations regarding its business practices. Tenet is responding to a Justice Department subpoena regarding the outlier
payments at the Company’s Tarzana facility.

On March 9,
2004, Tenet announced that it amended its Bank Credit Agreement which reduced the aggregate commitments available under the Revolving Credit Facility, including funded loans and letters of credit, from $1,200,000,000 to $800,000,000 with a limit on
funded loans of $500,000,000 and letters of credit of $300,000,000. Tenet also announced that currently there are no funded loans and $215,000,000 of letters of credit are outstanding.

We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these recent developments may have on individual hospital performances and the
related lease payments due to us by Tenet. The failure or inability of Tenet to pay its obligations to us could materially reduce our revenue and net income, which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders and cause our
stock price to decline.



Loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust would have significant adverse consequences to us.

We currently operate and have operated commencing with
our taxable year ended December 31, 1985 in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of
highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our
ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must satisfy a number of
requirements regarding the composition of our assets. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income, excluding capital gains. In addition, new legislation,
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust for tax purposes. Although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in such
manner, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes.

If we lose our real estate investment trust status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make
payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a real estate investment trust for four taxable years following the year
during which we were disqualified.

In addition,
if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and we would not be required to make
distributions to stockholders.

As a result of all these
factors, our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the market value of our securities.

Tax law changes may adversely affect our stock price.

The federal income tax laws governing REITs and other corporations or the
administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time. Any new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect our stock price. The current maximum tax rate for non-corporate taxpayers for certain
“qualified” dividends has generally been reduced from 38.6% to 15% (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002). In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends, except to
the extent the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiaries), to income that was subject to tax at the corporate/REIT level or to dividends properly designated by us as
“capital gain dividends.” Although these tax rate changes do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends paid by REITs, the more favorable treatment of regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to
consider stock of other corporations that pay dividends to be more attractive relative to stock of REITs, which may adversely effect our stock price and our ability to raise additional capital.

Our operators are faced with increased litigation and rising insurance costs that may
affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments.

In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at health care facilities, and these groups have brought litigation against operators. Also, in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded
in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs of monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance incurred by our tenants. In addition, the
cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of health care facilities continues. Continued cost increases could cause our
tenants to be unable to pay their lease or mortgage payments, potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs. Moreover, to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities, our revenue from those
facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time.



We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and if our access to such capital is difficult or
on commercially unreasonable terms, we may not be able to meet maturing commitments or make future investments necessary to grow our business.

In order to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required, among other things, each year to distribute to our stockholders at least
90% of our REIT taxable income. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, we rely on
external sources of capital. If we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources, we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business, or to meet our obligations and commitments as
they mature, which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even, in extreme circumstances, affect our ability to continue operations. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control,
including general market conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock.

Since real estate investments are illiquid, we may not be able to sell properties when we
desire.

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold
quickly. We may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to vacancies or economic conditions. This inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our ability to service debt and make
distributions to our stockholders. In addition, there are limitations under the federal income tax laws applicable to REITs that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets.

Transfers of health care facilities generally require regulatory approvals and alternative
uses of health care facilities are limited.

Because
transfers of health care facilities may be subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate, there may be delays in transferring operations of our facilities to
successor tenants or we may be prohibited from transferring operations to a successor tenant. In addition, substantially all of our properties are health care facilities that may not be easily adapted to non-health care related uses. If we are
unable to transfer properties at times opportune to us, our revenue and operations may suffer.

Some potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We require our tenants and mortgagors to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us, as well as the tenants or mortgagors on all of our properties. Some types of losses, however,
either may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure against. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future
revenue from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not
occur in the future.



Item 2.

PROPERTIES

We are organized to invest in income-producing health care related facilities. In evaluating potential investments, including making loans, we consider
such factors as:

•

The geographic area, type of property and demographic profile;

•

Our cost of capital;

•

The location, construction quality, condition and design of the property;

•

The expertise and reputation of the operator;

•

The current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs and lease obligations;

•

Whether the rent provides a competitive market return to our investors;

•

The potential for capital appreciation;

•

The tax laws related to real estate investment trusts;

•

The regulatory and reimbursement environment in which the properties operate;

•

Occupancy and demand for similar health facilities in the same or nearby communities;

•

An adequate mix between private and government sponsored patients at health facilities;

•

Potential alternative uses of the facilities;

•

Prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing; and

•

The availability of qualified property managers or whether we can manage the property.



The following table reflects certain property information and includes properties in which we invest
directly, as well as through joint ventures and mortgage loans (Dollar amounts in thousands).





(1)

Hospitals and long-term care facilities are measured by licensed bed count. Assisted living and retirement facilities are apartment-like facilities and are therefore stated in units
(studio, one or two bedroom apartments). Medical office buildings and other health care facilities are measured in square feet.

(2)

Represents the historical cost of our real estate investments and the net book value of our unconsolidated joint ventures and secured loans receivable. Excludes assets to be sold
and classified as discontinued operations.

(3)

This information is derived from information provided by our tenants for the most recently provided quarter through September 30, 2003. Excluded are facilities under construction,
newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities, and facilities where the data is not available or not meaningful. Occupancy computations are weighted by number of beds/units/square feet. Long-term care facilities are computed using
available beds which can sometimes be less than the number of licensed beds a facility may have. All occupancy percentages represent performance by our tenants’ health care operations and occupancy for medical office buildings.

(4)

Since the tenant is responsible for operating expenses under a triple-net lease, management believes revenues are not comparable between property types without deducting our
operating expenses for properties leased under gross or modified gross leases.

Item 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

During 2003, we were not a party to any material legal proceedings.

On March 12, 2004, James G. Reynolds, our Executive Vice President and current Chief Financial Officer, filed a lawsuit
against the Company and Kenneth B. Roath, our Chairman, and James F. Flaherty III, our Chief Executive Officer and a director. The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court of California, County of Orange and is styled

James G. Reynolds vs. Health Care
Property Investors, Inc., Kenneth B. Roath and James Flaherty, III, et al.

Reynolds, 52, alleges, among other things, breach of oral contract, promissory fraud, defamation, wrongful constructive termination, infliction of emotional distress and
age discrimination. In his complaint, Reynolds claims that he was promised an employment contract providing that, in the event he was terminated in breach of contract, he would receive two years of salary and bonus, and accelerated vesting of all
unvested stock options and restricted stock as if he had been employed through and including five years after the date of such termination. Reynolds also claims that he was promised a supplemental executive retirement plan and an enhanced
operational role in the Company. He further claims that he is owed $200,000 of unpaid wages relating to an alleged unpaid bonus for 2001 performance. Reynolds seeks unspecified compensatory, consequential and punitive damages relating to his claims.
The Company believes that Reynolds’ claims are not meritorious and intends to contest them. Reynolds disagrees with this conclusion.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Set forth below
for the fiscal quarters indicated are the reported high and low closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. As of March 2, 2004, each shareholder received one additional share of common stock for each share they own resulting
from a 2-for-1 stock split announced by the Company on January 22, 2004. The stock split has been reflected in all periods presented.

As of March 9,
2004 there were approximately

5,704 stockholders of record and approximately

77,515 beneficial stockholders of our common stock.

It has been our policy to declare quarterly dividends to the common stock shareholders so as to comply with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code governing REITs. The cash dividends per share paid on common stock are set forth below:

HCPI/Utah I

. On
January 25, 1999, we completed the acquisition of a managing member interest in HCPI/Utah, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“HCPI/Utah”), in exchange for a cash contribution of approximately $18,900,000. In connection with this
acquisition, several limited liability companies and general partnerships affiliated with The Boyer Company, L.C. (“Boyer”) contributed a portfolio of 14 medical office buildings (including two ground leaseholds associated therewith) to
HCPI/Utah with an aggregate equity value (net of assumed debt) of approximately $18,900,000. In exchange for this capital contribution, the contributing entities received 593,247 non-managing member units of HCPI/Utah. At the initial closing,
HCPI/Utah was also granted the right to acquire additional medical office buildings. Four additional buildings have been contributed to HCPI/Utah and the contributing entities received 133,134 non-managing member units of HCPI/Utah. An additional
56,489 non-managing member units were received by the contributing entities as a result of earn-outs on certain of the buildings.

The Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of HCPI/Utah (the “Agreement”) provides that only we are authorized to act on
behalf of HCPI/Utah and that we have responsibility for the management of its business.

The non-managing member units are exchangeable for common stock on a one unit for two shares basis (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications) or for an amount of cash equal to the
then-current market value of the shares of common stock into which the non-managing member units may be exchanged. HCPI/Utah relied on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with the issuance
and sale of the non-managing member units. We have registered 1,506,546 shares of our common stock for issuance from time to time in exchange for units.

HCPI/Utah II

. On August 17, 2001, we completed the acquisition of a managing member interest in HCPI/Utah, II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (“HCPI/Utah II”), in exchange for a cash contribution of approximately $32,800,000. In connection with the acquisition, several limited liability companies and general partnerships affiliated with Boyer, contributed a portfolio of
four medical office buildings, five health care laboratory and biotech research facilities (seven of which buildings are owned through ground leasehold interests) and undeveloped land on which a future building was to be constructed to HCPI/Utah



II with an aggregate equity value (net of assumed debt) of approximately $25,700,000. In exchange for this capital contribution, the contributing entities
received 738,923 non-managing units of HCPI/Utah II. At the initial closing, HCPI/Utah II was also granted the right to acquire eight additional medical office buildings. Subsequent contributions have resulted in the acquisition of four additional
buildings. During 2002, HCPI/Utah II was granted the right to acquire and a new contributing entity contributed one additional medical office building to HCPI/Utah II. In connection with the contribution of these five additional buildings and as a
result of earn-outs on certain buildings, the contributing entities have received 257,157 non-managing member units since the initial closing.

The Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of HCPI/Utah II, as amended (the “HCPI/Utah II Agreement”) provides that only we
are authorized to act on behalf of HCPI/Utah II and that we have responsibility for the management of its business. Finally, in 2002, HCPI/Utah II completed documentation relating to the construction of a new building adjacent to one of the
contributed projects. Upon completion of construction, the original contributing entity is entitled to receive certain non-managing member units in accordance with the terms of the agreements among the parties and we will receive managing member
units.

The non-managing member units are exchangeable for
common stock on a one unit for two shares basis (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications) or for an amount of cash equal to the then-current market value of the shares of common stock into which the non-managing
member units may be exchanged. HCPI/Utah II relied on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with the issuance and sale of the non-managing member units

.

We have registered 1,477,846
shares of our common stock for issuance from time to time in exchange for units.

HCPI/Tennessee

. On October 2, 2003, we completed the acquisition of a managing member interest in HCPI/Tennessee, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“HCPI/Tennessee”), in exchange for the
contribution of property interests with an aggregate equity value (net of assumed debt) of approximately $7,000,000 and $169,000 in cash. In connection with the acquisition, MedCap Properties, LLC contributed certain property interests to
HCPI/Tennessee with an aggregate equity value (net of assumed debt) of approximately $48,181,000 In exchange for this capital contribution, MedCap Properties, LLC received 1,064,539 non-managing units of HCPI/Tennessee. MedCap Properties distributed
its non-managing member units in HCPI/Tennessee to certain members of management of MedCap Properties, including Charles A. Elcan, who is now an Executive Vice President of HCPI. HCPI/Tennessee also issued 158,395 managing member units to HCPI.

The Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement
of HCPI/Tennessee (the “HCPI/Tennessee Agreement”) provides that only we are authorized to act on behalf of HCPI/Tennessee and that we have responsibility for the management of its business.

Each non-managing member unit of HCPI/Tennessee is redeemable after October
2, 2004 for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of two shares of our common stock or, at our option, two shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications).
HCPI/Tennessee relied on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with the issuance and sale of the non-managing member units.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward Looking Statements

Statements in this Annual Report that are not historical factual statements are “forward looking statements”
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements include, among other things, statements regarding the intent, belief or expectations of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and its officers and can be
identified by the use of terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “should” and other comparable terms or the negative
thereof. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while forward looking
statements reflect our good faith belief and best judgment based upon current information, they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the
expectations contained in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors. In addition to the factors set forth under “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, readers should consider the following:

(a)

Legislative, regulatory, or other changes in the health care industry at the local, state or federal level which increase the costs of or otherwise affect the operations of our
tenants;

(b)

Changes in the reimbursement available to our tenants and mortgagors by governmental or private payors, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment levels and the
availability and cost of third party insurance coverage;

(c)

Competition for tenants and mortgagors, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases;

(d)

Availability of suitable health care facilities to acquire at a favorable cost of capital and the competition for such acquisition and financing of health care facilities;

(e)

The ability of our tenants and mortgagors to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase revenues and to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan
payments;

(f)

The financial weakness of operators in the long-term care and assisted living sectors, including the bankruptcies of certain of our tenants, which results in uncertainties in our
ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators’ leases;

(g)

Changes in tax laws;

(h)

Changes in national or regional economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital; and

(i)

The risk that we will not be able to sell or lease facilities that are currently vacant.

General

Health Care Property Investors, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated joint ventures (HCP), generally acquires health care
facilities and leases them on a long-term basis to health care providers. We also lease medical office space to providers and physicians on a shorter term basis. In addition, we provide mortgage financing on health care facilities.

As of December 31, 2003, our portfolio of properties, including those
invested in through joint ventures and mortgage loans, consisted of 554 facilities located in 44 states. These facilities are comprised of 31 hospitals, 173 long-term care facilities, 124 assisted living and retirement living facilities, 196 medical
office buildings and 30 other health care facilities. Our investment in these properties, which represents the historical cost of our real estate investments and the net book value of our unconsolidated joint ventures and secured loans receivable,
was approximately $3.4 billion at December 31, 2003.

Significant Accounting
Policies and Estimates

The following are our significant
accounting policies and estimates:

Revenue Recognition

Rental revenue from our tenants is our principal
source of revenue. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101), as amended. We recognize base rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the
related lease when collectibility is deemed probable. Additional rental income based on a percentage of a tenant’s increased revenue over a specified base period revenue is deferred until the annual (rather than quarterly) base period revenue
is exceeded. If we overestimate the collectibility of rental and other income, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected.



Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis. Based on these reviews, we have
established provisions and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as required as a charge
to operations in our consolidated statements of operations. The total amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents the cumulative provisions less writeoffs of uncollectible rent, is recorded against tenant and other receivables on
our consolidated balance sheets. If we underestimate the required allowances for doubtful accounts our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected.

Real Estate Investments

We record the acquisition of real estate at cost and allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible assets and intangible assets that arise
from contractual or other legal rights, including in-place leases, based on their respective fair values. The fair value for land and buildings is typically based on appraised value and replacement cost as if vacant, respectively. The fair value of
in-place leases is determined based on the present value of above or below market rents, tenant origination costs and the net lease income from in-place leases over a reasonable lease-up period.

We compute depreciation on our properties using the straight-line method
based on an estimated useful life ranging up to 45 years. We compute depreciation on equipment, tenant improvements and lease costs using the straight-line method and an estimated useful life ranging up to 10 years or the lease term, whichever is
appropriate. If the allocation to building or estimates of useful life of our properties changes, depreciation and amortization expense may change which may impact our results of operations.

Investments in Joint Ventures

We have adopted Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities on Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (FIN 46) for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and consolidate variable interest entities in which we absorb a majority of the entity’s
expected losses, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. For entities that do not qualify as variable interest entities, we
consolidate those entities that are majority owned and controlled.

Since we have not adopted FIN 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, we continue to consolidate the accounts of all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and certain general and limited partnerships created
prior to that date. For investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures created before February 1, 2003 in which we may serve as the general partner or managing member where the other members in these joint ventures have significant
voting rights relative to acquisition, sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets, we continue to account for these investments using the equity method of accounting. The accounting policies of these joint
ventures are substantially consistent with ours. We are currently evaluating the effects on us, if any, of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically review long-lived assets (primarily real estate, investments
in unconsolidated joint ventures and notes receivable) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability and determination of the fair value of
long-lived assets involves significant judgment and is based on an analysis of the future operating results or projected rents for each long-lived asset. Properties to be sold are recorded at the lower of cost or expected sales price less costs to
sell. Our ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value which may significantly impact our results of operations.

Discontinued Operations

We have reclassified certain facilities’ operations as Discontinued Operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (Statement 144) which was issued in August 2001. Statement 144 established accounting and reporting standards requiring that long-lived assets to be disposed of be
reported as Discontinued Operations if management has committed to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms within one year of establishing the plan to sell.



Stock Options

On January 1, 2002, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” (Statement 123), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.” We adopted the fair value provisions of
Statement 123 prospectively so that the fair value of all stock options granted on or after January 1, 2002 is recognized as compensation expense. Since only new grants are accounted for under the fair value method, stock based compensation expense
is less than which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. Our 2001 operating results were not impacted by the adoption of the fair value method. We use the Black Scholes model for calculating the fair
value of option grants which requires us to make certain estimates including the expected stock volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend yield and the term of the option. Changes in our estimates could significantly impact our results of
operations.

Stock Split

On January 22, 2004, we announced a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a
stock dividend for each outstanding share of common stock on February 4, 2004. The stock split has been reflected in all periods presented.

Results of Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2003 we had the following significant developments:

•

We acquired 11 properties for an aggregate purchase price of $189,400,000 in 2003. These properties have an average annual lease rate of 9.7%, based on our cost of the properties.
The properties consist of nine assisted and retirement living facilities, one medical office building and one other health care facility.

•

On October 2, 2003, together with HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (HCP MOP), a joint venture that we formed in June 2003 with GE Commercial Finance, we completed the $575,000,000
acquisition of MedCap Properties, LLC, which includes ownership interests in 113 medical office buildings. We are the managing member of HCP MOP and have a 33% economic interest therein. Eight of the acquired medical office buildings, with a cost of
$48,181,000, were contributed to a joint venture between us and senior MedCap management. The joint venture issued 1,064,539 units valued at $45.26 each, which are redeemable for cash, or, at our option, common stock beginning October 2, 2004.

•

We sold 27 facilities for an aggregate net sales price of $56,110,000 and a net gain on sale of $12,136,000.

•

We issued 4,000,000 shares of 7.25% Series E and 7,820,000 shares of 7.1% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of
$295,500,000.

•

We redeemed all of our outstanding 7.875% Series A, 8.7% Series B, 8.6% and Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for an aggregate of $293,040,000.

•

We issued 2,800,000 shares of common stock at a net offering price of $20.75 per share and issued 6,187,800 shares at an average price per share of $19.94 under our Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), for gross proceeds totaling $181,479,000.

•

We issued $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2015. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in March and September.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 as Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2002

Net Income applicable to common shares
for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $121,849,000 or $0.97 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $400,183,000. This compares to Net Income applicable to common shares of $112,480,000 or $0.96 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of
$349,116,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2003 are preferred stock redemption charges of $18,553,000, or $0.15 per share on a diluted basis, a net gain on
real estate dispositions of $12,136,000, or $0.10 per share on a diluted basis and property impairments of $13,992,000, or $0.11 per share on a diluted basis. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002,
is a net loss on real estate dispositions of $1,129,000, or $0.01 per share on a diluted basis, and property impairments of $9,200,000, or $0.08 per share on a diluted basis.

Rental Income attributable to our properties, excluding Medical Office Buildings, for the year ended December 31, 2003
increased 6.7%, or $15,685,000, to $248,773,000. The increase is primarily the result of facility acquisitions made during 2003 and 2002. Medical Office Building Rental Income for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 12.2%, or $10,869,000, to
$99,876,000 with a related increase in Operating Expenses from Medical Office Buildings of 23.4%, or $7,336,000, to $38,694,000. These increases were generated primarily from 2003 and 2002 acquisition and construction activity. Interest and



Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 86.4%, or $22,544,000 to $48,645,000 as a result of higher interest income levels from the
September 2002 loan to ARC as well as a partial prepayment of that loan in September 2003. Equity Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased $1,969,000 to $2,889,000 due to the equity income generated
from our investment in HCP MOP.

Tenet, ARC, Emeritus, Kindred
and HealthSouth accounted for 16%, 9%, 5%, 5% and 5% of our 2003 Revenue Less Operating Expenses, respectively. No other single tenant or operator accounts for more than 5% of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Interest Expense for the year ended December 31, 2003,
increased 17.2%, or $13,331,000, to $90,749,000. The increase is primarily due to the issuance of $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6% long-term debt in February 2003 and $250,000,000 of 6.45% long-term debt in June 2002. Our investments
are primarily financed with fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates will not have a significant impact to interest expense until our debt matures and must be financed. Real Estate Depreciation from continuing operations increased 7.7%, or
$5,640,000, to $79,095,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of acquisitions in 2003 and 2002. General and Administrative Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 32.0%, or $5,998,000, to $24,731,000. The increase is
primarily the result of costs related to vacant properties, an increase in troubled properties, temporary duplicate asset management functions resulting from the acquisition and transition of MedCap Properties, LLC and increased compensation costs.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended
December 31, 2002 totaled $112,480,000 or $0.96 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $349,116,000. This compares to Net Income applicable to common shares of $96,266,000 or $0.89 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $317,484,000 for
2001. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002, is a net loss on real estate dispositions of $1,129,000, or $0.01 per share on a diluted basis, and property impairments of $9,200,000, or $0.08 per share
on a diluted basis. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2001 is a net loss on real estate dispositions of $6,248,000 or 0.06 per share on a diluted basis, and property impairments of $6,160,000, or
$0.06 per share on a diluted basis, related to the disposal of seven facilities.

Rental Income attributable to our properties, other than Medical Office Buildings, for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 9.0%, or $19,333,000, to $233,088,000. The increase is primarily the result of
acquisitions made during 2001 and 2002 which resulted in the addition of 39 facilities. Medical Office Building Rental Income for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 8.7% or $7,107,000, to $89,007,000 with a related increase in Operating
Expenses for Medical Office Buildings of 8.9%, or $2,555,000, to $31,358,000. These increases were generated primarily from 2001 and 2002 acquisition and construction activity which resulted in the addition of 17 facilities. Interest and Other
Income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 19.6%, or $4,279,000, to $26,101,000 as a result of the new loan to American Retirement Corporation and a loan prepayment fee we collected in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Tenet, Emeritus, Kindred and HealthSouth accounted for 18%, 5%, 5% and 5% of
our 2002 Revenue Less Operating Expenses, respectively. No other single tenant or operator accounts for more than 5% of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Interest Expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, decreased $589,000 to
$77,418,000. The decrease is primarily due to the refinancing of approximately $125,000,000 of long-term debt with lower rate short-term and long-term debt. Real Estate Depreciation from continuing operations increased 9.5% or $6,384,000 to
$73,455,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of the 2002 and 2001 acquisitions. General and Administrative Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 42.2%, or $5,558,000, to $18,733,000. The increase is primarily the
result of costs related to vacant and troubled properties and increased compensation costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flows from operating activities represent the primary source of liquidity to fund distributions. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders.
Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock. During 2003, we issued dividends totaling $206,166,000 and $18,183,000 to holders of our common and preferred stock,
respectively. We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to finance our operations for the foreseeable future.

Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi-tenant buildings and the rental rates on our leases. Material changes in
either of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



The following reflects the annual impact by year in terms of 2003 Revenues Less Operating Expenses
resulting from lease expirations and mortgage loan maturities (Dollar amounts in thousands):

(1)

Table excludes non-property specific revenue of $5,622 and equity income and acquisition and management fees earned from HCP MOP of $4,185.

(2)

Since the tenant is responsible for operating expenses under a triple-net lease, management believes revenues are not comparable between property types without deducting our
operating expenses for properties leased under gross or modified gross leases.

Debt

Since our
anticipated distributions will not allow us to retain sufficient cash to repay all of our debt as it comes due using only cash flows provided by operating activities, we intend to repay maturing debt with proceeds from debt and/or equity offerings.
In addition, we anticipate making future investments in facilities, which will be dependent on the availability of cost-effective sources of capital. Since the completion of our initial public offering in 1985, we have used the public debt and
equity markets as our principle source of financing. Our senior debt is rated BBB+ by both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch and Baa2 by Moody’s and has been rated medium investment grade continuously since 1986, when we first received a
bond rating.

As of December 31, 2003, we have the following
outstanding debt:

Revolving Line of Credit -

We have a
revolving line of credit totaling $490,000,000 which expires October 2005. Borrowings under the line of credit were $198,000,000 at December 31, 2003. The weighted average annual interest rate for 2003 was 2.1%.

Mortgage Notes Payable -

At December 31, 2003, we had a total of
approximately $158,808,000 in Mortgage Notes Payable secured by 32 health care facilities with a net book value of approximately $272,359,000. Interest rates on the Mortgage Notes ranged from 2.75% to 10.63% with a weighted average rate of 7.9%.

Senior Notes

- At December 31, 2003, we had a total of
$1,054,421,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 6.13% to 9.10% with a weighted average rate of 6.89% in 2003. During 2003, we issued $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6%
Senior Notes due 2015, repaid $31,000,000 of maturing long-term debt with an average interest rate of 7.09% and redeemed $5,000,000 in Medium Term Notes due March 10, 2015, which carried an interest rate of 9.00%. These payments were initially
financed with funds available under our revolving line of credit.



The following table summarizes our debt maturities by year, at December 31, 2003 (Amounts in thousands):

At December 31, 2003,
stockholders’ equity totaled $1,440,617,000 and our equity securities had a market value of $3,462,704,000. Total debt represents 27.2% and 49.4% of our total market and book capitalization, respectively.

Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2003, we have outstanding 4,000,000 shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock and
7,820,000 shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock, both of which were issued during the year for gross proceeds totaling $295,500,000. During 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7.875% Series A, 8.7% Series B and 8.6%
Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock. As a result of redeeming the cumulative redeemable preferred stock at an amount higher than its carrying amount, we recorded preferred stock redemption charges totaling $18,553,000 during 2003.

Equity

On July 10, 2003, we issued 2,800,000 shares of our common stock at an
offering price, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of $20.75 per share. We received gross proceeds from the offering of $58,100,000.

During 2003, we issued and sold 6,187,800 shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share
of $19.94 for an aggregate of $123,379,000. Recent optional investment activity in the DRIP has declined significantly from previous levels due to the exclusion of certain participants who were managing multiple accounts and engaging in short term
trading activities. The optional investment in December 2003 was $243,000 as compared with average monthly optional investments during the first 11 months of 2003 of $8,964,000. Also, beginning January 1, 2004, the Company reduced the discount on
its shares of common stock purchased through the DRIP from 2% to 1%.

As of December 31, 2003, there were a total of 2,643,508 non-managing member units outstanding in four limited liability companies of which we are the managing member: HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; HCPI/Utah, LLC; HCPI/Utah II, LLC; and
HCPI/Indiana, LLC. The non-managing member units of HCPI/Utah, LLC, HCPI/Utah II, LLC and HCPI/Indiana, LLC are convertible into our common stock on a one unit for two shares basis. Each non-managing member unit of HCPI/Tennessee, LLC is redeemable
after October 2, 2004 for an amount of cash approximating the then current market value of two shares of our common stock or, at our option, two shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we issued 1,064,539 non-managing
member units of HCPI/Tennessee, LLC as part of the MedCap Properties, LLC acquisition described earlier.

Shelf Registrations

As of December 31, 2003, we had $1,500,000,000 available for future issuances of debt and equity securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These securities may be issued from time to
time in the future based on our needs and the then-existing market conditions.



Letters of Credit and Depositor Accounts

At December 31, 2003, we held approximately $13,514,000 in depository accounts and $40,020,000 in irrevocable letters of
credit from commercial banks to secure a number of tenants’ lease obligations and borrowers’ loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans. Amounts
available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors and such changes may be material.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC

On October 2, 2003, together with HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (HCP MOP), a joint venture that we formed in June 2003 with GE Commercial Finance, we
completed the $575 million acquisition of MedCap Properties, LLC, which includes ownership interests in 113 medical office buildings.

HCP MOP acquired 100 of the medical office buildings at an acquisition price of $460 million. We are the managing member of HCP MOP and have a 33%
interest therein. In addition to our indirect ownership interest in the medical office buildings through our joint venture interest, we will earn acquisition and management fees and an additional return if certain investment hurdles are achieved
with respect to these properties. At the time of the acquisition, HCP MOP assumed $26 million in mortgage debt at an interest rate of approximately 7%.

Summarized financial information as of December 31, 2003, and for the period from October 2, 2003 to December 31, 2003 of the unconsolidated joint venture
follows (Amounts in thousands):

Five of the acquired
medical office buildings are construction projects we acquired with scheduled completion dates in 2004 and an expected total cost of $67,000,000. As of December 31, 2003, these assets had a carrying amount of $37,199,000. It is expected HCP MOP will
acquire these assets after completion of construction.

On
January 20, 2004, HCP MOP completed $288,000,000 of mortgage financings of which $254,000,000 is at a weighted average fixed rate of 5.57% and the balance is at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 1.75%. The Company received $92,000,000 of net
proceeds from the financing. Our Revenue from HCP MOP, including fees earned by us, represented approximately 1% of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses during 2003.

Tenant improvements, lease acquisition costs and operating expenses are funded through property operations. The Company may
be required to provide additional funding if the joint venture does not have sufficient funds to cover these expenditures.



Other Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2003, we had an 80% interest in each of five joint ventures that own six long-term care facilities, a 45%-50% interest in four joint
ventures that each own an assisted living facility and a 9.8% interest in five joint ventures that own five retirement living communities. The five joint ventures that own five retirement living communities are subsidiaries of American Retirement
Corporation.

Summarized financial information at December 31,
2003, and for the year then ended, of the unconsolidated joint ventures follows (Amounts in thousands):

As of December 31,
2003, we had guaranteed approximately $7,100,000 on notes payable obligations for four of these joint ventures. As of December 31, 2003, the five retirement living communities owned by the five joint ventures in which we have a 9.8% interest secured
$55,532,000 of first mortgages with fixed and variable interest rates ranging from 2.54% to 9.5% and maturity dates ranging from January 2004 to June 2025.

Included in “Other Partners’ Capital” above are the proceeds from a loan of $76,228,000 as of December 31, 2003 from HCP to a subsidiary of
American Retirement Corporation.

Our Revenue from those joint
ventures represented less than 1% of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses.

During 2003, we acquired four retirement living facilities for $163,500,000 in which we previously owned a 9.8% equity interest. Additionally we closed a $7,000,000 secured loan to ARC. Three of the properties are
leased to ARC and the fourth to a third party that has contracted with ARC to manage the facility. ARC used $52,000,000 of the proceeds from the transaction to repay a portion of an outstanding loan to us including accrued interest.

Our maximum exposure to losses for our joint ventures at December 31, 2003 is
the carrying value of the joint venture investments, including advances to and our investment in the HCP MOP development properties, of $210,045,000 and an additional $7,100,000 resulting from the guarantee of notes payable discussed above, which
represents 7% of our consolidated assets and 15% of our consolidated stockholder’s equity. Our exposure may increase if we are required to provide any additional funding to HCP MOP.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2003, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (amounts in thousands):

As of December 31,
2003, the company had no significant contingent liabilities.



Item 7a.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our investments are financed by the sale of common and preferred stock, long-term and medium-term debt, internally generated cash flows, and some
short-term bank debt.

We generally have fixed base rent on our
leases; in addition, there can be additional rent based on a percentage of increased revenue over specified base period revenue of the properties and/or increases based on inflation indices or other factors. Financing costs are comprised of
dividends on common and preferred stock, interest on long-term and medium-term debt and short-term interest on bank debt.

On a more limited basis, we have provided mortgage loans to operators of health care facilities in the normal course of business. All of the mortgage
loans receivable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with periodic fixed increases. Therefore, the mortgage loans receivable are all considered to be fixed rate loans, and the current interest rate (the lowest rate) is used in the
computation of market risk provided in the following table if material.

We may assume existing mortgage notes payable as part of an acquisition transaction. Currently we have two mortgage notes payable with variable interest rates and the remaining mortgage notes payable have fixed interest rates or interest
rates with fixed periodic increases. Our Senior Notes are at fixed rates, with one exception for a $25,000,000 variable rate senior note for which management has fixed the interest rate by means of a swap contract. The variable rate loans are at
interest rates below the current prime rate of 4.00%, and fluctuations are tied to the prime rate or to a rate currently below the prime rate.

At December 31, 2003, we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $4,075,000 of variable rate mortgage notes payable and
$198,000,000 of variable rate bank debt on our total investment in our properties of $3.4 billion.

Fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt matures and must be
replaced or refinanced. Interest rate changes will affect the fair value of the fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not affect the fair value on
those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt including the mortgage notes payable and the bank lines of credit, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of year end,
interest expense for 2003 would increase by approximately $2,021,000, or $0.02 per common share on a diluted basis.

The principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by the final maturity dates is presented in the
following table. The fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans. The fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting
future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity.



Readers are cautioned that most of the statements contained in the “Disclosures about Market
Risk” paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures under the heading “Cautionary Language Regarding Forward Looking Statements” previously set forth.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (Interpretation No. 46) effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003
and for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that is acquired before February 1, 2003. During October 2003, and again in December 2003,
the FASB met and agreed to defer the effective date of Interpretation No. 46 for variable interests acquired before February 1, 2003. The deferral will require public companies to adopt the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 for such variable
interests in periods ending after March 15, 2004 (that is, the quarter ending March 31, 2004 for the Company).

We have adopted Interpretation No. 46 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. Interpretation No. 46 requires the consolidation of
variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial
interests in the entity. For entities that do not qualify as variable interest entities, we consolidate those entities that are majority owned and controlled.

Since we have not adopted Interpretation No. 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, we continue to consolidate the accounts
of all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and certain general and limited partnerships created prior to that date. For investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures created before February 1, 2003 in which we may serve as
the general partner or managing member where the other members in these joint ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition, sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets, we continue to account
for these investments using the equity method of accounting. The accounting policies of these joint ventures are substantially consistent with ours. We are currently evaluating the effects on us, if any, of the adoption of Interpretation No. 46 for
variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (Statement 150). Statement 150 requires that mandatorily
redeemable financial instruments be classified as a liability and recorded at settlement value as of the balance sheet date. As a result, consolidated partnerships with a limited-life are considered mandatorily redeemable. On October 29, 2003, the
FASB met and voted to defer implementation of the provisions of Statement 150 that require the valuation and establishment of a liability for limited-life entities. Statement 150 would have applied to seven limited-life partnerships. Effective
October 2003, we amended the agreement for one of these partnerships to remove the limited-life provision. The minority interest in this partnership is not mandatorily redeemable and is not subject to the disclosure provisions of Statement 150. As
of December 31, 2003, we have estimated the settlement value of the minority interests in the remaining six partnerships to be approximately $4,500,000, which is approximately $2,500,000 more than the carrying amount of such minority interests.

Item 9.

CHANGES IN DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

We have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accounting and financial disclosure.

Item 9a.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have
investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our
consolidated subsidiaries.



As required by Rule 13(a)-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other
factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date we completed our evaluation.

*

Management Contract or Compensatory Plan or Arrangement.

For the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, the
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be incorporated by reference into registrant’s Registration Statement on Form S-8 Nos. 33-28483 and 333-90353 filed May 11, 1989 and November 5, 1999, respectively,
Form S-8 Nos. 333-54786 and 333-54784 each filed February 1, 2001, and Form S-8 No. 333-108838 filed September 16, 2003.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and
is therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors

Health Care Property Investors, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Health Care Property
Investors, Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)
THE COMPANY

Health Care Property Investors, Inc., a
Maryland corporation, was organized in March 1985 to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and its affiliated subsidiaries and joint ventures (HCP) were organized to invest in health care related
properties located throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2003, we own or have investments in 554 properties located in 44 states, net of assets to be sold. The properties include 31 hospitals, 173 long-term care facilities, 124 assisted
and retirement living facilities, 196 medical office buildings (MOBs) and 30 other health care facilities. As of December 31, 2003, we provided mortgage loans on or leased these properties to 97 health care operators and to approximately 2,100
lessees.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Rental and Interest Income:

Rental Income includes base and additional rental income. We recognize
revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” (SAB 101) as amended. We recognize base rental income and interest on mortgages on a straight-line basis over the term of the
related lease or mortgage when collectibility is deemed probable. Additional rental income based on a percentage of a tenant’s increased revenue over a specified base period revenue is deferred until the annual (rather than quarterly) base
period revenue is exceeded.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We have established provisions and maintain an allowance
for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as required as a charge to operations in our consolidated statements of
operations. The total amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents the cumulative provisions less write-offs of uncollectible rent, is recorded against accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets.

Properties Managed By Third Parties:

We have ownership interests in 180 Medical Office Buildings and 17 other
health care properties which are managed by independent property management companies on our behalf. These facilities are leased to multiple tenants under triple net, gross or modified gross leases. For those properties that we consolidate, we
record expenses related to the operation of these facilities as Operating Expenses for Medical Office Buildings in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Real Estate Investments:

We record the acquisition of real estate at cost and allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible assets and intangible assets that arise
from contractual or other legal rights, including in-place leases, based on their respective fair values. The fair value for land and buildings is typically based on appraised value and replacement cost as if vacant, respectively. The fair value of
in-place leases is determined based on the present value of above or below market rents, tenant origination costs and the net lease income from in-place leases over a reasonable lease-up period.

Depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight-line method over
the asset’s estimated useful life. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated lives ranging up to 45 years. Lease-related tangible and intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives or the lease
term. The above and below market rent intangible is amortized to revenue while all other lease intangibles are amortized to expense.

We periodically evaluate our real estate investments for potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash
flows to be generated from the investment. If such impairments were to occur, we would write-down our investment in the property to its estimated fair value. Fair value for properties to be held and used is based on the present value of the future
cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. Properties to be sold are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, which is based on the expected sales price, less costs to sell.

F-7


Principles of Consolidation:

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (Interpretation No. 46) effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and for the first fiscal year or interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003 for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that is acquired before February 1, 2003. During October 2003, and again in December 2003, the FASB met and agreed to defer the
effective date of Interpretation No. 46 for variable interests acquired before February 1, 2003. The deferral will require public companies to adopt the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 for such variable interests in periods ending after March
15, 2004 (that is, the quarter ending March 31, 2004 for the Company).

We have adopted Interpretation No. 46 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. Interpretation No. 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the
entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. For entities that do not qualify as variable interest
entities, we consolidate those entities that are majority owned and controlled.

Since we have not adopted Interpretation No. 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, we continue to consolidate the accounts of all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and certain
general and limited partnerships created prior to that date. For investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures created before February 1, 2003 in which we may serve as the general partner or managing member where the other members
in these joint ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition, sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets, we continue to account for these investments using the equity method of accounting.
The accounting policies of these joint ventures are substantially consistent with ours. We are currently evaluating the effects on us, if any, of the adoption of Interpretation No. 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003.

Federal Income Taxes:

We have operated at all times so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856
to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As such, we are not taxed on our income that is distributed to stockholders. At December 31, 2003, the tax basis of our net assets and liabilities is less than the reported amounts by
approximately $287,000,000. The majority of this difference is attributable to the merger of American Health Properties, Inc. in 1999, wherein, for reporting purposes the assets are recordable at fair value while their tax bases remain at historical
cost. Additional variances are caused by several limited liability companies that we consolidate where the assets were recorded at fair value when acquired while their tax bases remained at historical cost, and by accelerated depreciation for tax
purposes.

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability
of dividends to stockholders, differ from net income for financial statements due to the treatment required under the Internal Revenue Code of certain interest income and expense items, differences in depreciable lives and the basis of certain
assets, and the timing of recognition of rental income.

Discontinued
Operations:

We have reclassified certain facilities as
Discontinued Operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (Statement 144). Statement 144 requires long-lived assets disposed of or to be
disposed of to be reported as Discontinued Operations if management has committed to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms within one year.

Stock Options:

On January 1, 2002, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” (Statement 123), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.” We adopted the fair value provisions of
Statement 123 prospectively with the fair value of all new stock option grants recognized as compensation expense beginning January 1, 2002. Since only new grants are accounted for under the fair value method, stock based compensation expense is
less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. Our 2001 operating results were not impacted by the adoption of the fair value method. We use the Black Scholes model for calculating the fair
value of option grants which requires us to make certain estimates including the expected stock volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend yield and the term of the option. Compensation expense for awards with pro-rata vesting is recognized using
the straight-line method of amortization.

F-8


Derivatives and Hedging:

Accounting and reporting standards require that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be
recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized as other comprehensive income or loss if specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If these criteria
are not met, changes in the fair value are included in earnings.

During 1999, we entered into a $25,000,000 swap contract through which the variable interest rate on a senior note payable is fixed until its February 2004 maturity. We have reflected the unrealized loss on the swap contract based on the
change in fair market value of $1,023,000 and ($164,000) during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), which is recorded as Other Equity in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
Equity.

In April 2003, the FASB released Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June
30, 2003. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements:

Management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Segments:

We view our operations as
principally one segment, namely the ownership of health care related assets. All assets have been aggregated for financial reporting purposes. No other segment information is considered meaningful.

Stock Split:

As of March 2, 2004, each shareholder received one additional share of common stock for each share they own resulting from a
2-for-1 stock split declared by the Company on January 22, 2004. The stock split has been reflected in all periods presented.

Reclassification:

Certain reclassifications have been made for comparative financial statement presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics
of both Liabilities and Equity” (Statement 150). Statement 150 requires that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments be classified as a liability and recorded at settlement value as of the balance sheet date. As a result, consolidated
partnerships with a limited-life are considered mandatorily redeemable. On October 29, 2003, the FASB met and voted to defer implementation of the provisions of Statement 150 that require the valuation and establishment of a liability for
limited-life entities. Statement 150 would have applied to seven limited-life partnerships. Effective October 2003, we amended the agreement for one of these partnerships to remove the limited-life provision. The minority interest in this
partnership is not mandatorily redeemable and is not subject to the disclosure provisions of Statement 150. As of December 31, 2003, we have estimated the settlement value of the minority interests in the remaining six partnerships to be
approximately $4,500,000, which is approximately $2,500,000 more than the carrying amount of such minority interests.

Major Operators:

Listed below are our major operators which represented three percent or more of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003.
All of the companies listed below are publicly traded companies and are subject to the informational filing requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and accordingly file periodic financial statements on Form 10-K and Form
10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We can make no representations as to the completeness or accuracy of these reports.

Less than 1%

Certain operators of our properties, including some of the above, are experiencing financial, legal and regulatory difficulties. The loss of any of these operators or a combination of smaller operators could have a
material impact on our results of operations or financial position. Additionally, the operators of the Company’s properties are dependent to varying degrees on government reimbursements, which could decrease and contribute to financial
difficulties. We evaluate the ability of our operators to make their lease payments, however, actual results may differ from our estimates.

(6) INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO JOINT VENTURES

HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC

On October 2, 2003, together with HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (HCP MOP), a joint venture that we formed in June 2003 with GE Commercial Finance, we
completed the $575 million acquisition of MedCap Properties, LLC, which included ownership interests in 113 medical office buildings.

HCP MOP acquired 100 of the medical office buildings at an acquisition price of $460 million. We are the managing member of HCP MOP and have a 33%
interest therein with voting rights equal to the other member. In addition to our indirect ownership interest in the medical office buildings through our joint venture interest, we will earn acquisition and management fees and an additional return
if certain investment hurdles are achieved with respect to these properties. At the time of the acquisition, the joint venture assumed $26 million in mortgage debt at an interest rate of approximately 7%.

Summarized unaudited financial information as of December 31, 2003, and for the period from October 2,
2003 to December 31, 2003 of the unconsolidated joint venture follows (Amounts in thousands):

Five of the acquired
medical office buildings are construction projects we acquired with scheduled completion dates in 2004 and an expected total cost of $67,000,000. As of December 31, 2003, these assets had a carrying value of $37,199,000. These assets are expected to
be acquired by HCP MOP upon completion of construction.

The
remaining eight of the acquired medical office buildings, with a cost of $48,181,000, were contributed to a joint venture between us and senior MedCap management. The joint venture issued 1,064,539 units valued at $45.26 each, which are redeemable
for cash or, at our option, HCP common stock beginning October 2, 2004. This joint venture is consolidated in our financial statements.

On January 20, 2004, HCP MOP completed $288,000,000 of mortgage financings of which $254,000,000 is at a weighted average fixed rate of 5.57% and the
balance is at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 1.75%. The Company received $92,000,000 of net proceeds from the financing.

Tenant improvements, lease acquisition costs and operating expenses are funded through property operations. The Company may be required to provide
additional funding if the joint venture does not have sufficient funds to cover these expenditures.

F-14


Other Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2003, we had an 80% interest in each of five joint ventures that lease six long-term care facilities, a
45%-50% interest in four joint ventures that each operate an assisted living facility and a 9.8% interest in five joint ventures that own five retirement living communities. The joint ventures that own five retirement living communities are
subsidiaries of American Retirement Corporation.

Summarized
unaudited financial information at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and for the years then ended, of the unconsolidated joint ventures and limited liability companies follows (Amounts in thousands):

As of December 31,
2003, we had guaranteed approximately $7,100,000 on notes payable obligations for four of these joint ventures. As of December 31, 2003, the five retirement living communities owned by the five joint ventures of which we have a 9.8% interest secured
$55,532,000 of first mortgages with fixed and variable interest rates ranging from 2.54% to 9.5% and maturity dates ranging from January 2004 to June 2025.

Included in “Other Partners’ Capital” above are the proceeds from a loan of $76,228,000 and $112,750,000 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, from HCP to a subsidiary of American Retirement Corporation.

During 2003, we acquired four retirement living facilities for $163,500,000 in which we previously owned a 9.8% equity interest. Additionally, we closed a $7,000,000 secured loan to ARC. Three of the properties are
leased to ARC and the fourth to a third party that has contracted with ARC to manage the facility. ARC used $52,000,000 of the proceeds from the transaction to repay a portion of an outstanding loan to us including accrued interest.

Prior to our acquisition of these properties, we accrued interest at 13.25%
on our loan to ARC and reserved the difference between 13.25% and the 19.5% contractual rate. During 2003, we increased the accrual rate to 16.5% and recognized $1,200,000 of interest that was reserved at December 31, 2002. The increased accrual
rate was determined based on our evaluation of the sufficiency of the net assets collateralizing the loan.

Our maximum exposure to losses for our joint ventures at December 31, 2003 is the carrying value of the joint venture investments, including advances to
and our investment in the HCP MOP development properties, of $210,045,000 and an additional $7,100,000 resulting from the guarantee of notes payable discussed above. Our exposure may increase if we are required to provide any additional funding to
HCP MOP.

semi-annually in March and September. On June 25, 2002, we issued $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.45% Senior Notes due 2012. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in June and December.

A summary of Senior Notes outstanding at December 31, 2003 follows (dollar

issue discounts are amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. The option payment relates to the unamortized portion of a put option associated with $200,000,000 principal amount of 6.875% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed Securities (MOPPRS) due June
8, 2015 which are subject to mandatory tender on June 8, 2005. The put option is being amortized to interest expense over 17 years. We may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the MOPPRS at face value on June 8, 2005. The interest rate on
any remaining MOPPRS from June 8, 2005 to the final maturity date will be reset to 5.565% plus an applicable spread.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we paid off $31,000,000 of maturing long-term debt with an average interest rate of 7.09% and redeemed $5,000,000
in Medium Term Notes due 2015 which carried an interest rate of 9.00%. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we paid off $124,579,000 of maturing long-term debt with an average interest rate of 7.20%.

At December 31, 2003, we had a total of $158,808,000 in Mortgage Notes Payable secured by 32 health care facilities with a
net book value of approximately $272,359,000. Interest rates on the Mortgage Notes ranged from 2.75% to 10.63%.

F-17


Bank Notes Payable:

In October 2002, we closed on a new three-year revolving line of credit totaling $490,000,000. The new line bears an annual facility fee of 0.25%. The
agreement provides for interest at the Prime Rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.875% or at a rate negotiated with each bank at the time of borrowing. An additional fee of 0.125% is paid on borrowings when borrowings exceed 50% of
the $490,000,000 capacity. Interest rates incurred by us ranged from 1.40% to 4.00% and 2.15% to 3.51% on maximum short-term bank borrowings of $437,600,000 and $309,800,000 for 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted average interest rates were
approximately 2.06% and 2.63% on weighted average short-term bank borrowings of $187,193,000 and $188,115,000 for 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Our debt maturities by year at December 31, 2003 follows (Dollar amounts in thousands):

(9) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We have contractual commitments to acquire or construct
$116,000,000 of health care real estate and capital projects including $29,000,000 of construction projects we may be required to fund related to HCP MOP

In connection with the transfer of operations of certain long-term care or assisted living facilities from existing lessees to replacement
lessees/operators, we have provided limited indemnities and guaranties pertaining to certain matters relating to such facilities prior to the date transfer date. Our maximum potential exposure for these limited indemnities and guaranties was
$2,555,000 as of December 31, 2003, although we expect actual costs, if any, related to these indemnities to be nominal.

We are from time to time parties to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims in the ordinary course of our business. These claims, even if not
meritorious, could force us to spend significant financial resources. We are not aware of any legal proceedings or claims against us that we believe will have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
financial condition or results of operations.

One of the
Company’s hospitals located in Tarzana, California, and operated by Tenet under a lease expiring in February 2009 is affected by State of California Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute
care hospital facilities. The Company and Tenet are currently reviewing the SB 1953 compliance of this hospital, multiple plans of action to cause such compliance, the estimated time for completing the same and the cost of performing necessary
remediation of the property. The Company cannot currently estimate the potential costs of SB 1953 compliance with respect to the affected hospital or the final allocation of such costs between the Company and Tenet. Rent on the hospital in 2003 was
$10.8 million and the net book value is $81 million.

(10) COMMON STOCK

During 2003, we issued 2,800,000 shares of common stock
at a net offering price of $20.75 per share, generating net proceeds of $58,100,000. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we also raised $123,379,000 at an average price per share of $19.94 under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
(DRIP). Since implementation of the new DRIP in March 2001, $236,571,000 has been raised through the issuance of new common equity under the DRIP.

During December 2003, optional investment activity in the DRIP declined significantly from previous levels due to the exclusion of certain participants
who were managing multiple accounts and engaging in short term trading activities. The optional investment in December 2003 was $243,000 as compared with average monthly optional investments during the first 11 months of 2003 of $8,964,000. Also,
beginning January 1, 2004, the Company reduced the discount on its shares of common stock purchased through the DRIP from 2% to 1%.

(11) PREFERRED STOCK

On September 15, 2003, we issued 4,000,000 shares of 7.25% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25 per share, generating gross proceeds of
$100,000,000.

On December 3, 2003, we issued 7,820,000 shares
of 7.1% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25 per share, raising gross proceeds of $195,500,000.

On May 2, 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding 8.6% Series C preferred stock. The amount paid to redeem the preferred stock was approximately
$99,415,0000 plus accrued dividends. The redemption amount above our carrying amount of the Series C preferred stock gave rise to a non-operating charge of $11,800,000.

F-18


On September 10, 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7.875% Series A preferred stock. The amount
paid to redeem the Series A preferred stock was approximately $60,000,000 plus accrued dividends. The redemption amount above our carrying amount of the Series A preferred stock gave rise to a non-operating charge of $2,200,000.

On October 1, 2003, we redeemed all of our 8.7% Series B preferred stock. The
amount paid to redeem the Series B preferred stock was approximately $133,625,000 plus accrued dividends. The redemption amount above our carrying amount of the Series B preferred stock gave rise to a non-operating charge of $4,600,000.

Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2003 is comprised of two
series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock summarized as follows:

redemption and are not convertible into any other securities of HCP. The carrying value of preferred stock approximates fair value.

(12) OTHER EQUITY

Other equity consists of the following:

Deferred compensation
is the value of incentive stock awards granted to employees and directors.

Other comprehensive loss is a reduction of net income in calculating comprehensive income. Comprehensive income is the change in equity from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 was $159,608,000 and $137,216,000, respectively.

Loans secured by stock in HCP to directors and officers total $236,000 and $2,259,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are classified in Other Equity on the Statement of Stockholders’ Equity. The interest rate charged
is based on the prevailing applicable federal rate as of the inception of the loan and averaged 4.63% and 3.71% for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The authority for HCP to maintain such loans was agreed furthered under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

(13) OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS

As of December 31, 2003, there were a total of 2,643,508
non-managing member units outstanding in four limited liability companies of which we are the managing member: HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; HCPI/Utah, LLC; HCPI/Utah II, LLC; and HCPI/Indiana, LLC. The non-managing member units of HCPI/Utah, LLC, HCPI/Utah
II, LLC and HCPI/Indiana, LLC are convertible into our common stock on a one unit for two shares basis. Each non-managing member unit of HCPI/Tennessee, LLC is redeemable after October 2, 2004 for an amount of cash approximating the then current
market value of two shares of our common stock or, at our option, two shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we issued 1,064,539 non-managing member units of HCPI/Tennessee, LLC as part of the MedCap Properties, LLC
acquisition described earlier.

F-19


(14) EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

We compute earnings per share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share.
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing Net Income applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated including the
effect of dilutive securities. Approximately 1,000,000 options to purchase shares of common stock that had an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the common stock during 2003 were not included because they are not dilutive.
Additionally, shares issuable upon conversion of 2,643,508 non-managing member units were not included since they are not dilutive.

During the fourth
quarter of 2003, we changed our diluted earnings per share calculation related to the treatment of unvested restricted stock grants and employee stock options. The impact of the change resulted in 696,000 additional shares included in the number of
shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share in 2002, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.01.

(15) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value. The carrying amount for Cash and Cash Equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments. Fair values for Secured Loans Receivable, Senior Notes and Mortgage Notes Payable are based on the
estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans and instruments of comparable maturities, and are as follows:

(16) STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

Directors, officers and key employees of the Company are
eligible to participate in our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (Plan). During 2003, 5,000,000 additional shares were authorized to be issued under the plan with approximately 7,013,000 shares available for future awards at December 31, 2003. Stock options
are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Stock options and restricted stock awards generally vest over a five year period. A summary of the status of our Plan at December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 and changes during the years then ended is presented in the following table and narrative:

F-20


The following table describes the options outstanding as of December 31, 2003.

The fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following ranges of assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 3.99% to 5.13%; expected dividend yields of 8.65% to 8.85%; expected lives of 10 years;
and expected volatility of .1916 to .2064.

As of January 1,
2002, we commenced recognizing compensation expense using the fair value method in accordance with Statement 123. Previously, we had accounted for all stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (APB 25), which is permitted under Statement 123. Had compensation expense for stock options been determined based on the fair value method for all awards, our Net Income and Basic Earnings Per Common Share would have been lower by
approximately $313,000, $468,000 and $638,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively or less than $0.01 per diluted share of commons stock.

(17) DIVIDENDS (UNAUDITED)

Common stock dividend payment dates are scheduled approximately 50 days following the end of each calendar quarter. On February 19, 2004, we paid a
dividend of $0.4175 per share to stockholders of record on February 4, 2004.

In order to qualify as a REIT, we must generally, among other requirements, distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders. HCP and other REITs generally distribute 100% of taxable income to avoid
taxes on the remaining 10% of taxable income.

F-21


Per share dividend payments made by HCP to the stockholders were characterized in the following manner
for tax purposes:

Dividends on all
series of preferred stock are paid on the last day of each quarter.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

On January 22, 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Stockholders of
record as of the close of business on February 4, 2004 received one additional share of common stock for each share they own on March 2, 2004. The stock split has been reflected in all periods presented.

On January 22, 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.4175 per share. The common stock cash dividend was paid on February 19, 2004 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 4, 2004.

On January 22, 2004, the Company announced the undertaking of certain
corporate governance initiatives that it believes are in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s Board of Directors amended the Company’s stockholder rights plan (“poison pill”) causing the rights to
expire on February 2, 2004 and has approved amendments to the Company’s charter and bylaws that would declassify its Board of Directors and provide for the annual election of directors. Under the current classified system, directors are elected
to a three-year term and approximately one-third of the full board is up for election each year. The charter amendment providing for declassification will require stockholder approval, which the Company intends to seek at its 2004 annual
stockholders’ meeting.

On February 27, 2004, the Company
sold seven medical office buildings and ten other health care facilities for a sales price of $127,550,000 and paid off $31,349,000 of related mortgage debt at on average rate of 7.67%. The taxable gain from the sale was deferred under section 1031
of the tax code. The income from operations from the 17 properties for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $7,514,000 which was composed of revenue of $18,146,000, operating expenses of $5,477,000, depreciation expense of $3,767,000 and interest
expense of $1,388,000. The Company had a gain on the sale of approximately $7,400,000 which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2004.

On January 16, 2004, the Company acquired a healthcare laboratory and biotech research facility located in San Diego, California for a purchase price of
$40,000,000.

On March 12, 2004, James G. Reynolds, our
Executive Vice President and current Chief Financial Officer, filed a lawsuit against the Company and Kenneth B. Roath, our Chairman, and James F. Flaherty III, our Chief Executive Officer and a director. The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court of

James G. Reynolds vs. Health Care Property Investors, Inc., Kenneth B. Roath and James Flaherty, III, et al

. Reynolds, 52, alleges, among other things, breach of oral contract, promissory fraud,
defamation, wrongful constructive termination, infliction of emotional distress and age discrimination. In his complaint, Reynolds claims that he was promised an employment contract providing that, in the event he was terminated in breach of
contract, he would receive two years of salary and bonus, and accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options and restricted stock as if he had been employed through and including five years after the date of such termination. Reynolds also claims
that he was promised a supplemental executive retirement plan and an enhanced operational role in the Company. He further claims that he is owed $200,000 of unpaid wages relating to an alleged unpaid bonus for 2001 performance. Reynolds seeks
unspecified compensatory, consequential and punitive damages relating to his claims. The Company believes that Reynolds’ claims are not meritorious and intends to contest them. Reynolds disagrees with this conclusion.
