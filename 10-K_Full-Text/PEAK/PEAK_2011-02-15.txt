ITEM 1.    Business

Business Overview

HCP, an S&P 500 company, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. We are a
self-administered, Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT") organized in 1985. We are headquartered in Long Beach, California, with offices in Nashville, Tennessee and San Francisco,
California. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate, and provide financing to healthcare providers. Our portfolio is comprised of investments in the following five
healthcare segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical office, (iv) post-acute/skilled nursing and (v) hospital. We make investments
within our healthcare segments using the following five investment products: (i) properties under lease, (ii) debt investments, (iii) developments and redevelopments,
(iv) investment management and (v) DownREITs.

The
delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that
the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following:

•

Compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services;

•

Specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and

•

Ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector.

Our
website address is

www.hcpi.com

. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish them to, the United States
("U.S.") Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Healthcare Industry

Healthcare is the single largest industry in the U.S. based on Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). According to the National Health
Expenditures report dated September 2010 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"): (i) national health expenditures are projected to grow 4.2% in 2011; (ii) the average
compounded annual growth rate for national health expenditures, over the projection period of 2009 through 2019, is anticipated to be 6.3%; and (iii) the healthcare industry is projected to
represent 17.4% of U.S. GDP in 2011.

Senior
citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services. According to CMS, on a per capita basis, the 75-year and older segment of the population spends 76% more on
healthcare than the 65 to 74-year-old segment and over 200% more than the population average.

Business Strategy

Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on
three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification and (iii) conservative financing.

Opportunistic Investing

We make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value. We attempt to position
ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria.

Portfolio Diversification

We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment, geography, operator, tenant and investment
product. Diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business and allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market
dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of diversification, we monitor, but do not limit, our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type,
investment product, geographic location, the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant, or loans we may make to a single borrower. With investments in multiple segments
and investment products, we can focus on opportunities with the most attractive risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole. We may structure transactions as master leases, require operator or
tenant insurance and indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk.

Conservative Financing

We believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach. We strive to
maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt-to-equity levels and maintaining multiple
sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit facility, access to capital markets and secured debt lenders, relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture
partners, and our ability to divest of assets. Our debt obligations are primarily fixed rate, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations.



We
finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange
for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing through offerings of equity and debt securities, placement of mortgage debt
and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors.

We
specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in Item 7, "2010 Transaction Overview," included elsewhere in this report.

Competition

Investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment
companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower
costs of capital than us. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete may also be
impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new
legislation and population trends.

Rental
and related income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels, including: the
quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price and range of services offered, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians,
staff, referral sources, location, the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas, and the financial condition of our tenants and operators. Private, federal and state payment
programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators. For a discussion of the risks associated with
competitive conditions affecting our business, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

Healthcare Segments

Senior housing.

At December 31, 2010, we had interests in 251 senior housing facilities, including 25 facilities owned by our
Investment
Management Platform. Senior housing facilities include independent living facilities ("ILFs"), assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"), which cater to
different segments of the elderly population based upon their needs. Services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through
private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Our senior housing property types are further described below:

•

Independent Living Facilities.

ILFs are designed to meet
the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need assistance with
activities of daily living ("ADL"), such as bathing, eating and dressing. However, residents have the option to contract for these services. At December 31, 2010, we had
interests in 45 ILFs.

•

Assisted Living Facilities.

ALFs are licensed care
facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with ADL yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social
activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents.
These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher levels of personal assistance
for residents with Alzheimer's disease or other



forms
of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. At December 31, 2010, we had interests in 194 ALFs.

•

Continuing Care Retirement Communities.

CCRCs provide
housing and health-related services under long-term contracts. This alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change,
thus allowing residents to "age in place." Some CCRCs require a substantial entry or buy-in fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some
health services. CCRCs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry. At December 31, 2010, we had interests in 12 CCRCs.

Our
Investment Management Platform represents the following unconsolidated joint ventures: (i) HCP Ventures II, (ii) HCP Ventures III, LLC, (iii) HCP Ventures
IV, LLC, and (iv) the HCP Life Science ventures. On January 14, 2011, the Company acquired its partner's 65% interest in HCP Ventures II, becoming the sole owner of this 25 senior
housing property portfolio ("HCP Ventures II Acquisition"). For a more detailed description of these unconsolidated joint ventures, see Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our
senior housing segment accounted for approximately 31%, 30% and 30% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table
provides information about our senior housing operator concentration for the year ended December 31, 2010:

properties formerly operated by Sunrise were transitioned to Emeritus effective November 1, 2010. The percentage of segment revenues and total
revenues for Sunrise excludes revenues from the transitioned properties, which are included in the revenues for Emeritus.

(2)

Certain
of our properties are leased to tenants who have entered into management contracts with Sunrise to operate the respective property on their behalf.
To determine our concentration of revenues generated from properties operated by Sunrise, we aggregate revenue from these tenants with revenue generated from the two properties that are leased
directly to Sunrise.

Life science.

At December 31, 2010, we had interests in 102 life science properties, including four facilities owned by our
Investment
Management Platform. These properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, scientific research institutions, government agencies and other
organizations involved in the life science industry. While these properties contain similar characteristics to commercial office buildings, they generally contain more advanced electrical, mechanical,
and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ("HVAC") systems. The facilities generally have equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops and
related amenities. In many instances, life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space, in addition to landlord improvements, to accommodate biology or chemistry
research initiatives. Life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple facilities and buildings. The business park and campus settings allow us
the opportunity to provide flexible, contiguous/adjacent expansion that accommodates the growth of existing tenants in place. Our properties are located in well established geographical markets known
for scientific research, including San Francisco, San Diego and Salt Lake City.



Our
life science segment accounted for approximately 22%, 22% and 21% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively. The following table

Medical office.

At December 31, 2010, we had interests in 253 medical office buildings ("MOBs"), including 66 facilities owned by
our
Investment Management Platform. These facilities typically contain physicians' offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services
such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings, they require additional plumbing,
electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room, and special equipment such as x-ray machines. In addition, MOBs are often built
to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain "vaults" or other specialized construction. Our MOBs are typically multi-tenant properties leased to healthcare providers
(hospitals and physician practices) and are primarily located on hospital campuses. Approximately 83% of our MOBs, based on square feet, are located on hospital campuses.

Our
medical office segment accounted for approximately 25%, 27% and 27% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During the year ended
December 31, 2010, HCA, Inc. ("HCA"), as our tenant, contributed 13% of our medical office segment revenues.

Post-acute/skilled nursing.

At December 31, 2010, we had interests in 45 post-acute/skilled nursing facilities
("SNFs"). SNFs offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and
revenues from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous
therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain SNFs provide some of the foregoing services on
an out-patient basis. Post-acute/skilled nursing
services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for either by private sources or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. All of our SNFs are leased to single
tenants under triple-net lease structures.

In
addition to our interests in SNFs, at December 31, 2010 our post-acute/skilled nursing segment includes debt investments in HCR ManorCare, Inc. ("HCR
ManorCare") and Genesis HealthCare ("Genesis"), with par values of $1.72 billion and $328 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.

On
December 13, 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the real estate assets of HCR ManorCare, for a total consideration of $6.1 billion
(the "HCR ManorCare Acquisition") that includes: (i) $3.53 billion in cash; (ii) $1.72 billion (par value) reinvestment of our existing debt investments in HCR ManorCare;
and (iii) subject to certain adjustments, 25.7 million shares of our common stock to be issued directly to the shareholders of HCR ManorCare, or, at our option, a cash equivalent of
$852 million. Upon closing, we will acquire 334 HCR ManorCare post-acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. A wholly-owned subsidiary of HCR ManorCare will continue to
operate the assets pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease supported by a guaranty from HCR ManorCare. For a more detailed description of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition
and these debt investments, see Notes 5 and 7, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our
post-acute/skilled nursing segment accounted for approximately 12%, 10% and 11% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The following table

In
September and October 2010, we acquired debt investments in Genesis with an aggregate par value of $328 million. The percentages of segment and
total revenues presented for Genesis reflect revenues for a partial year.

Hospital.

At December 31, 2010, we had interests in 21 hospitals, including four facilities owned by our Investment Management
Platform.
Services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance and Health Maintenance Organizations or "HMOs"), or
through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our hospital property types include acute care, long-term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals. Our hospitals are all leased to
single tenants or operators under triple-net lease structures.

In
addition to our interests in hospitals, our hospital segment also includes mezzanine and mortgage loan investments, which at December 31, 2010 aggregated to
$107 million.

Our
hospital segment accounted for approximately 10%, 11% and 11% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table

2010, we sold our remaining HCA debt investments of $141 million, which contributed $10 million of interest income during 2010.

Investment Products

Properties under lease.

We primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under long-term leases. Most of our rents and other earned
income from leases are received under triple-net leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses. However, some of our MOBs and life science facility rents
are structured under gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such gross or modified gross leases, we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and
maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance.

Our
ability to grow income from properties under lease depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental
rates and occupancy levels, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries and (iii) control non-recoverable operating expenses. Most of our leases include contractual annual base rent
escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases and/or are a function of an inflation index.

Debt investments.

Our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities, which directly
or indirectly
own properties, and are subordinate to more senior debt, including mortgages and more senior mezzanine loans. Our interests in mortgages are issued by healthcare providers and are generally secured by
healthcare real estate.



Developments and Redevelopments.

We generally commit to development projects that are at least 50% pre-leased or when we believe that
market conditions will support speculative construction. We work closely with our local real estate service providers, including brokerage, property management, project management and construction
management companies to assist us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments. Our development and redevelopment investments are primarily in our life science and medical office
segments. Redevelopments are properties that require significant capital expenditures (generally more than 25% of acquisition cost or existing basis) to achieve property stabilization or to change the
primary use of the properties.

Investment Management.

We co-invest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as
partnerships or limited liability companies. We target institutional investors with long-term investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate.
Predominantly, we retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20% to 35% and serve as the managing member. These ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset
management fees, and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture.

Non-managing member LLC ("DownREITs").

Our DownREIT structures enable us to acquire and hold real estate in operating DownREIT
limited liability companies ("LLCs"). In connection with the formation of certain DownREIT LLCs, many members contribute appreciated real estate to the DownREIT LLC in exchange for
DownREIT units that can be exchanged at some future date for shares of our stock or, at our election, redeemed for cash. These contributions are generally tax-deferred, so that the
pre-contribution gain related to the real estate is not taxed to the contributing member. However, if the contributed real estate is later sold by the DownREIT LLC, the unamortized
pre-contribution gain that exists at the date of sale is specifically allocated and taxed to the contributing members. In many of these DownREITs, we entered into indemnification
agreements with our members, under which, if any of the appreciated real estate contributed by the members is sold by the DownREIT in a taxable transaction within a specified number of years after the
property was contributed, we will reimburse the affected members for the income taxes associated with the pre-contribution gain that is specifically allocated to the affected member. Since
the formation of our first DownREIT LLC, we have acquired more than $1.0 billion of real estate utilizing DownREIT structures.

Portfolio Summary

At December 31, 2010, we managed $14.5 billion of investments in our Owned Portfolio and Investment Management Platform.
At December 31, 2010, we also owned $467 million of assets under development, including redevelopment, and land held for future development.

Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement

Overview

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations
relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities. These regulations are
wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with
this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies
and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators
can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

We
seek to mitigate the risk to us resulting from the significant healthcare regulatory risks faced by our tenants and operators by diversifying our portfolio among property types and
geographical areas, diversifying our tenant and operator base to limit our exposure to any single entity, and seeking tenants and operators who are not largely dependent on Medicaid reimbursement for
their revenues. Based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators, excluding our medical office segment, at December 31, 2010 we estimate that approximately 7% and 4% of the
annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators are dependant on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, respectively.



The
following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases, to us.

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers' relationships and
arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from
filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and
fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations
of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the "Stark Law"), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to
entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing
presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1997, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and
administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal
or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state
false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring

qui tam

or "whistleblower" actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these
laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws.

Reimbursement

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among other sources, governmental healthcare programs, such as the
federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance carriers and health
maintenance organizations. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will
likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators.

Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need

Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and
inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states
require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process
related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants' and operators' abilities to expand or change their businesses.

Life Science Facilities

While certain of our life science tenants include some well-established companies, other such tenants are less established
and, in some cases, may not yet have a product approved by the Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale. Creating a new



pharmaceutical
product requires substantial investments of time and money, in part, because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry; it also entails considerable risk of failure in
demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance.

Senior Housing Entrance Fee Communities

Certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance
fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form of
long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility's financial condition,
establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of the
residents, restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters.

Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA")

Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are "public
accommodations" as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily
achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by
persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant.
Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an
ongoing one, and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.

Environmental Matters

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare
facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve myriad regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of
these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as
us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to
hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property
damages and the owner's or secured lender's liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such
substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral
which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. For a description of the risks associated with environmental matters, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.



ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

The section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

As
set forth below, we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following four categories:

•

Risks related to our business;

•

Risks related to tax matters including REIT-related risks; and

•

Risks related to our legal organizational structure.

Risks Related to Our Business

Volatility in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development
activities.

The global financial markets recently have undergone and may continue to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions. While the
capital markets have shown signs of improvement, the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our
ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities.

Market
volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures, that may result in a substantial decrease in the value
of our properties and those of our joint ventures. As a result, we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill, if any, which may require us to
recognize impairment charges in earnings.

We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is unavailable, limited or on unfavorable terms, we may not be able to
meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business.

We may not be able to fund, from cash retained from operations, all future capital needs. If we are unable to obtain internally needed
capital, we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. As a result, we rely on external sources of capital,
including debt and equity financing, to fulfill
our capital requirements. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including but not limited to:

•

general availability of credit and market conditions, including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost;

•

the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities;

•

the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions;

•

our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility;

•

financial integrity of our lenders that might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to
make additional loans to us, and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms, or at all;

•

the stability in the market value of our properties;



•

the financial performance of our operators, tenants and borrowers; and

•

issues facing the healthcare industry, including, but not limited to, healthcare reform and changes in government
reimbursement policies.

If
our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to refinance our debt obligations, fund dividend payments,
acquire properties and fund operations and development activities.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and negatively impact the market
price of our securities, including our common stock.

The credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt and preferred equity securities are based on our operating performance, liquidity and
leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can
access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings
deteriorate, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. Also, a downgrade
in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.

Our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations.

Our indebtedness as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $4.6 billion, and after giving effect to the sale of unsecured
notes issued on January 24, 2011 was approximately $7.0 billion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including in connection with the development or acquisition of
assets, which may be substantial. Any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and
principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, conduct development activities, make capital expenditures and
acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable to general
adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels. Increased future debt service obligations may limit
our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed.

Covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future,
require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage, leverage ratio, tangible net worth
requirements and REIT status. Our continued ability to incur indebtedness and operate in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants, which limit our operational
flexibility. For example, mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability, without the consent of the lender, to further encumber or sell the
applicable properties, or to replace the applicable tenant or operator. Breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and cross-defaults under certain of
our other indebtedness, even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee. Additionally, defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties, including
defaults



associated
with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator, may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness. Covenants that
limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

An increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt, and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets and limit
our acquisition and development activities.

If interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt. This increased cost could make the financing of any
acquisition and development activity more costly. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing
and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our
ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

From time to time, we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. See "Legal Proceedings" in
Part I, Item 3 in this report for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions
or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities
arising in connection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead
to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations.

A small number of operators, tenants and borrowers account for a large percentage of our revenues.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 38% of our total revenues are generated by our leasing or financial
arrangements with the following five companies: Emeritus 10%; HCR ManorCare 9%; Sunrise 8%; HCA 6%; and Brookdale 5%. Upon closing the anticipated HCR ManorCare Acquisition in March 2011, revenues
earned from HCR ManorCare will increase significantly. The failure or inability of these operators, tenants or borrowers to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well
as our results of operations, which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay, cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

We may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be
unable to successfully operate or occupy the underlying real estate, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.

If an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our
interest by acquiring title to the collateral. In some cases, as noted above, the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property
and, accordingly, we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity. Operators, tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against
our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. Foreclosure-related costs, high



loan-to-value
ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure. Even if we are
able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators, if at all,
which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment.

Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities.

Transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals, including change of
ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements, that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real
estate. The replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal, state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the
replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. If we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms, or at all, we may take possession of a facility,
which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses, all of which may materially adversely affect
our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase, or develop, suitable healthcare facilities, to grow our investment portfolio.

We face significant competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds,
healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us. Increased competition makes it more challenging
for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals. If we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline, identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of
healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially
adversely affected.

We may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants.

Healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. The
improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, are costly and at times tenant-specific. A new or replacement
operator or tenant may require different features in a property, depending on that operator's or tenant's particular operations. If a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a
property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant. Also, if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple
operators or tenants, we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to re-lease the space. These expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.



We face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and, under certain circumstances, prevent
completion of development activities once undertaken.

Large-scale, ground-up development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us, including risks
that:

•

a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or
failure to recover expenses already incurred;

•

the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and
higher materials, transportation, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make the completion of the development project less profitable;

•

construction and/or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;

•

the project may not be completed on schedule, which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service
expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including: natural disasters, labor conditions, material shortages, regulatory hurdles, civil unrest and acts of war; and

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the
property profitable.

These
risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.

We may develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these
structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that:

•

we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could
require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes;

•

our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including
the timing, terms and strategies for any investments;

•

our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to
fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and

•

our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.

From time to time, we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations, our business, results of operations and financial condition
may be materially adversely affected.

Acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. Successful integration of the operations
of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may encounter difficulties in
these integrations. Potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the



acquired
entity, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities. In addition, the acquired companies and their properties may
fail to perform as expected, including in respect of estimated cost savings. Inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future
revenues. Similarly, we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use. If we have difficulties with any of
these areas, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies,
we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions, and this may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions, which may involve the expenditure of significant funds.

We regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize shareholder value and believe that currently there are available a
number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business, given the recent industry consolidation trend. In connection with our review of such transactions, we regularly engage
in discussions with potential acquisition candidates, some of which are material. Any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities, the incurrence of debt, assumption of contingent
liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures, any of which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the financing required
for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all.

Loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us

We are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers. Although our chief executive officer has an employment agreement with us, we
cannot assure you that he will remain employed with us. The loss or limited availability of the services of our chief executive officer or any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit
and retain qualified personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in
the capital markets.

We may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future
revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense.

We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are
adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake, windstorm, flood and other natural
disasters and may be subject to other losses. In particular, our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity. While we purchase insurance for earthquake,
windstorm, flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, there is no assurance that such insurance
will fully cover such losses. These losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property. The insurance
market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future. In addition, there are certain
exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market.



Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments.

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or previous owner of real estate, we may be
required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous substances released at a property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation
and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages
and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Although we (i) currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe
are commercially reasonable, and (ii) generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, such liabilities could exceed the amount
of our insurance, the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may
materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. As the owner of a site, we may also be held liable under common law to third
parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. We may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us.

The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

We lease our properties directly to operators in most cases, and in certain other cases, we lease to third-party tenants who enter into
long-term management agreements with operators to manage the properties. Although our leases, financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide
us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict an operator or tenant, or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a
party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies. For example, we cannot evict
a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing. A debtor has the right to assume, or to assume and assign to a third party, or reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding.
If a debtor were to reject its leases with us, our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may be
substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. In addition, the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may
affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities, credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators. In addition, under
certain conditions, defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross-default under our other indebtedness. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the
applicable agreements in those circumstances, the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, delays in the
availability of funding or other material adverse consequences. In addition, many of our facilities are leased to health care providers who provide long-term custodial care to the elderly;
evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process, and may not be successful.

We may be required to impair the carrying values of the straight-line rents receivable or lease intangibles or impair the related carrying value of leased
properties.

Many of our operating leases also contain non-contingent rent escalators for which we recognize income on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. This method results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received, creating a straight-line
rent receivable asset included in the caption "Other assets, net" on our consolidated balance sheets. At some point during



the
lease, depending on its terms, the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straight-line rent which results in the straight-line rent receivable asset decreasing to zero
over the remainder of the lease term. We assess the collectability of the straight-line rent that is expected to be collected in a future period, and, depending on
circumstances, we may provide a reserve against the previously recognized straight-line rent receivable asset for a portion, up to its full value, that we estimate may not be recoverable.
In addition, upon acquisition of a leased property that we account for as an operating lease, we may record lease-related intangible assets. The balance of straight-line rent receivable at
December 31, 2010, net of allowances was $207 million. We had approximately $316 million of lease-related intangible assets, net of amortization, and $148 million of
lease-related intangible liabilities, net of amortization, associated with our operating leases at December 31, 2010. To the extent any of the operators or tenants for our properties, for the
reasons discussed above, become unable to pay amounts due, we may be required to impair the carrying values of the straight-line rents receivable or lease intangibles or may impair the
related carrying value of leased properties.

The current U.S. housing market may adversely affect our operators' and tenants' ability to increase or maintain occupancy levels at, and rental income from, our senior
housing facilities.

Our tenants and operators may have relatively flat or declining occupancy levels in the near-term due to falling home
prices, declining incomes, stagnant home sales and other economic factors. Seniors may choose to postpone their plans to move into senior housing facilities rather than sell their homes at a loss, or
for a profit below their expectations. Moreover, tightening lending standards have made it more difficult for potential buyers to obtain mortgage financing, all of which have contributed to the
declining home sales. In addition, the senior housing segment may continue to experience a decline in occupancy associated with private pay residents choosing to move out of the facilities to be cared
for at home by relatives due to the weak economy. A material decline in our tenants' and operators' occupancy levels and revenues may make it more difficult for them to meet their financial
obligations to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, may cease to operate or be unable to
meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

Certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal, state and local laws and regulations that are
subject to frequent and substantial changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing
law. See "Item 1—Business—Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement" above. For example, to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant
portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to:

•

statutory and regulatory changes;

•

retroactive rate adjustments;

•

recovery of program overpayments or set-offs;

•

administrative rulings;

•

policy interpretations;

•

payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers;

•

government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities); and

•

interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property.



In
recent years, governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures. Healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of
significant importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect
that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators' and tenants' costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. The failure of any of
our operators or tenants to comply with these laws, requirements and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us.

Operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to
meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

Certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and
regulations. Our operators' or tenants' failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from
federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. For example, certain of our properties may require a license and/or certificate of need to operate. Failure of any
operator or tenant to obtain a license or certificate of need, or loss of a required license or certificate of need, would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or
tenant. Additionally, failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us, and therefore
may materially adversely impact us. See "Item 1—Business—Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement—Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need"
above.

The impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted.

Legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes
in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. While Congress passed comprehensive legislation last year that provides for significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system over
the next ten years, Congress is currently considering making changes to that new legislation. In addition, the comprehensive health care legislation passed by Congress in 2010 provides for extensive
future rulemaking by regulatory authorities. We cannot accurately predict whether any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, these proposals would have on
our operators and tenants and, thus, our business. Similarly, while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our operators and
tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal health care programs, we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our
business.

Increased competition, as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast, have resulted in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may
affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

The healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future. The occupancy levels at, and rental income
from, our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income, and to compete with entities that have substantial
capital resources. These entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels, including: the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility,
price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location, and the size and
demographics of the population in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state



payment
programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants. Our operators and tenants also compete with
numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and
convalescent centers. Such competition, which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest, has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the
monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease. We cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities
will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Further, many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to
those of our operators and tenants. Thus, our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their
businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligation to us, potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and
dispute costs.

Our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses.

Our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that
covers us, as well as the tenants and operators. Some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur,
we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless
remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators. However, we cannot assure
you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future.

Our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs.

In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought
litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities. Also, in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect
of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition, their
cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues. Cost increases could cause our operators to
be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance, potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and
litigation costs. In addition, as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants, which
may require unanticipated expenditures on our part.

Our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty.

Life science tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique
risks, as follows:

•

some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research, development and clinical testing of their
products and technologies. If private investors, the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities, a tenant's business may be adversely affected or fail;



•

the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal,
state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain;

•

even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, the product may still present
significant regulatory and liability risks, including, among others, the possible later discovery of safety concerns, competition from new products, and ultimately the expiration of patent protection
for the product;

•

our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of
government or private healthcare payors; and

•

our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws.

We
cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses. If our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to
us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Tax and REIT-Related Risks

Loss of our tax status as a REIT would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely
within our control. We intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a REIT. However, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet, through actual
annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Code. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at
least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at
least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or
interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

If
we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we
issue and to make distributions to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we will be subject to corporate-level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income
at regular corporate rates;

•

we could be subject to increased local income taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for
the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a REIT.



As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could materially
adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of
properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since
we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers of property are properly treated as prohibited transactions. However, the determination that a transfer
constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transfer. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") may contend that certain transfers of properties by us are
prohibited transactions. While we believe that the IRS would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer of property constituted a prohibited transaction,
then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might materially adversely affect our ability to
satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

We could in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive.

Under certain circumstances, a stock dividend will be a taxable dividend if each stockholder can elect to receive the distribution in
cash, even if the aggregate cash amount paid to all stockholders is limited. Accordingly, if we decide to pay a stock dividend in such a manner, your taxable dividend will include the amount of stock
and your tax liability with respect to such dividend may be significantly greater than the amount of cash you receive.

We could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit, delay or impede future sales of our properties.

If, during the ten-year period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies, we recognize gain on the disposition of
any property acquired, then, to the extent of the excess of (i) the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over (ii) our adjusted income tax basis in such property
as of that date, we will be required to pay a corporate-level federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate. There can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will
not occur, and these requirements could limit, delay or impede future sales of our properties.

In
addition, the IRS may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies, in which case we will owe these
taxes plus interest and penalties, if any.

There are uncertainties relating to the calculation of non-REIT tax earnings and profits ("E&P") in certain acquisitions, which may require us to distribute E&P.

In order to remain qualified as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated non-REIT
E&P of certain companies that we acquire, prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. Failure to make such E&P distributions would result in our disqualification as a
REIT. The determination of the amount to be distributed in such E&P distributions is a complex factual and legal determination. We may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our
analysis, or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the IRS.



We
currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such E&P distributions. There are, however, substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of E&P, including the
possibility that the IRS could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased, which would increase our non-REIT E&P. Moreover, an audit of the
acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated non-REIT E&P, which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our
then-existing stockholders, if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default, or could result in our disqualification as a REIT.

Thus,
we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our non-REIT E&P by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. Moreover,
although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our E&P, we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on
us of doing so.

Risks Related to our Legal Organizational Structure

Our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock.

Our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us
in preserving our qualification as a
REIT. Under our charter, subject to certain exceptions, no person or entity may own, actually or constructively, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the
outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock.

Additionally,
our charter has a 9.9% ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares, which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock. Our
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit. The ownership limits may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that
might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

We are subject to certain provisions of Maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations.

The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations,
including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an "interested stockholder"
or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date no which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria
are met. An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a Maryland corporation.
Unless our Board of Directors takes action to exempt us, generally or with respect to certain transactions, from this statute in the future, the Maryland Business Combination Act will be applicable to
business combinations between us and other persons.

In
addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the Maryland Business Combination Act, our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations. Our charter
requires that, except in certain circumstances, "business combinations", including a merger or consolidation, and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities, with a "related person",
including a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock, be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding voting stock.

The
restrictions on business combinations provided under Maryland law and contained in our charter may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such
transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests.

Executive Summary

We are a self-administered REIT that, together with our unconsolidated joint ventures, invests primarily in real estate
serving the healthcare industry in the U.S. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers. At December 31, 2010, our
portfolio of investments, including properties owned by our Investment Management Platform, consisted of interests in 672 facilities and $2.0 billion of mezzanine and other secured loan
investments.

Our
business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) conservative financing. We actively
redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential. We make investments where the expected risk-adjusted return exceeds our cost of
capital and strive to capitalize on our operator, tenant and other business relationships.

Our
strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our
management team's experience and our infrastructure.



We
follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold real estate and debt investments for $230 million, resulting in gains of $33 million.

We
primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under long-term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under
triple-net leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses; however, some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified
gross leases. Accordingly, for such MOBs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees,
utilities and insurance. Our growth for these assets depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy
levels; (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures; and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market
specific, general economic and other conditions.

Access
to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of
additional securities or secured debt. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy.

2010 Transaction Overview

HCR ManorCare Facilities Acquisition

On December 13, 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the real estate assets of HCR ManorCare
for total consideration of $6.1 billion that includes: (i) $3.53 billion in cash; (ii) $1.72 billion (par value) reinvestment of our existing debt investments in HCR
ManorCare; and (iii) subject to certain adjustments, 25.7 million shares of our common stock to be issued directly to the shareholders of HCR ManorCare, or, at our option, a cash
equivalent of $852 million. We will acquire 334 HCR ManorCare post-acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The facilities are located in 30 states, with the highest
concentrations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois and Michigan. A wholly-owned subsidiary of HCR ManorCare will continue to operate the assets pursuant to a long-term
triple-net master lease supported by a guaranty from HCR ManorCare.

HCP Ventures II Purchase

On January 14, 2011, we acquired our partner's 65% interest in a joint venture that owns 25 senior housing assets, becoming the
sole owner of the portfolio. At closing, we paid approximately $137 million in cash for the interest and assumed our partner's share of approximately $650 million of Fannie Mae debt
secured by the assets. This transaction valued the venture's real estate assets at $860 million. The assets were originally acquired on October 5, 2006, through our acquisition of CNL
Retirement Properties, Inc., and were contributed to the joint venture in January 2007.

Acquired Debt Investments in Genesis Healthcare

In September and October 2010, we acquired debt investments in Genesis for $290 million, representing a $38 million
discount from their aggregate par value of $328 million. The investments represent a portion of the $1.671 billion of debt incurred with the $2.0 billion acquisition of Genesis in
July 2007. The $328 million investment consists of two participation interests in the senior term loan with an aggregate par value of $277.6 million that were purchased for
$249.9 million and a $50 million participation interest in the secured mezzanine debt that was purchased for $40 million.



The
senior loan bears interest on the par value at LIBOR (subject to a current floor of 1.5% increasing to 2.5% by maturity) plus a spread of 4.75% increasing to 5.75% by maturity. The
senior loan is prepayable anytime without penalty, matures in September 2014 and is secured by all of Genesis' assets. The mezzanine note bears interest on the par value at LIBOR plus a spread
of 7.50% and matures in September 2014. In addition to the coupon interest payments, the mezzanine note requires payment of a termination fee, of which our share is currently $2 million,
increasing to a maximum of $5 million if the debt is repaid in full at maturity. The mezzanine note is subordinate to the senior loan and secured by the indirect pledge of equity ownership in
Genesis' assets.

Transition of 27 Sunrise-managed Communities

On November 1, 2010, we exercised our rights to terminate management contracts relating to 27 senior housing communities
previously operated by Sunrise. We had acquired these termination rights as a part of our previously announced August 2010 settlement with Sunrise. These senior housing communities are now
master-leased to and operated by Emeritus. Our net investment to acquire the termination rights to transition these 27 communities to Emeritus was $41 million, which was comprised of a
$50 million payment to Sunrise that was partially offset for certain working capital acquired in conjunction with this transaction.

Other Investment Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we made additional investments of $431 million as follows:
(i) acquisition of real estate of $255 million; (ii) funding construction and other capital projects of $135 million primarily in our life science segment and
(iii) buyout of management contracts for 27 Sunrise-managed communities for $41 million (discussed above). Additional details regarding certain of the above investments are as
follows:

•

On July 26, 2010, we acquired a life science facility and two medical office buildings for approximately
$48 million, including DownREIT units valued at $9 million and assumed debt of $5 million. The life science facility represents 85,000 rentable square feet and is occupied by a
single tenant under a 15-year triple-net lease. The medical office buildings aggregate 103,000 rentable square feet and were 95% occupied at closing.

•

On June 1, 2010, we acquired four senior housing facilities for $102 million. These facilities are leased to
Emeritus under a master lease agreement that has an initial term of 10 years and two 10-year renewal options.

During
the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold investments of $230 million as follows: (i) $174 million of debt investments, recognizing gains of
$13 million and (ii) sales of real estate and other debt investments for $76 million, recognizing gain on sales of real estate of $21 million.

Financings

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we raised $2.5 billion in equity capital, as discussed
below:

•

On December 20, 2010, we completed a $1.472 billion public offering of 46 million shares of common
stock at a price of $32.00 per share and received total net proceeds of $1.413 billion.

•

On November 8, 2010, we completed a $486 million public offering of 13.8 million shares of common
stock at a price of $35.25 per share and received total net proceeds of $467 million.

•

In June 2010, we initiated a public offering, which resulted in the sale of 15.5 million shares of common
stock at a price of $33.00 per share for gross proceeds of $512 million. This offering included: (i) the June 2010 public offering of 13.5 million shares for
$445.5 million; and (ii) the



July 2010
sale of 2.025 million shares, for $66.8 million, as a result of the underwriters exercising the over-allotment option from the June 2010 public
offering. We received total net proceeds of $492 million from these sales.

On
January 24, 2011, we issued $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes as follows: (i) $400 million of 2.70% notes due 2014; (ii) $500 million of
3.75% notes due 2016; (iii) $1.2 billion of 5.375% notes due 2021; and (iv) $300 million of 6.75% notes due 2041. The notes have a weighted average maturity of
10.3 years and a weighted average yield of 4.83%. The net proceeds of the offering were $2.37 billion.

Dividends

Quarterly dividends paid during 2010 aggregated $1.86 per share. On January 27, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors
declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.48 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 23, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on
February 10, 2011. Based on the first quarter's dividend, the annualized rate of distribution for 2011 is $1.92, compared with $1.86, which represents a 3.2% increase.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires our
management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been
different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we
re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more
current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently
uncertain.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that
we control, through voting rights or other means. We consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("VIEs") when we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE at: (i) the inception of the
variable interest entity, (ii) as a result of a change in circumstance identified during our continuous review of our VIE relationships or (iii) upon the occurrence of a qualifying
reconsideration event.

We
make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors
includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the
entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the
entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a
VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our



consolidated
financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity, our assumptions may be different and may result in
the identification of a different primary beneficiary.

If
we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the VIE (either tenant or borrower) rather than
the results of the variable interest in the VIE. We would depend on the VIE to provide us timely financial information and rely on the internal control of the VIE to provide accurate financial
information. If the VIE has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely impact our financial reporting
and our internal control over financial reporting.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the
tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken
possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the
tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant
improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction
of revenue over the lease term. The determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment. If our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting
purposes were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.

Certain
leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized
when actual results
reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. The recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain
extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. Our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the
inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers
industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term
of the lease. We exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results,
which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Loans
receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. We
recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the effective interest method applied on a loan-by-loan basis when
collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums, discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans.

We
use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference
between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the



properties
is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably
assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized unearned income.

Loans
and DFLs are placed on non-accrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on
non-accrual status, loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, in which all
cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or DFL, based on management's judgment of collectibility.

Allowances
are established for loans and DFLs based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is deemed
probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual
terms of the loan or lease. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is
based upon our assessment of the borrower's or lessee's overall financial condition, resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if
appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan's or DFL's effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors. While
our assumptions are based in part upon historical data, our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Real Estate

We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based
upon the relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant,
land and in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect
the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the value of in-place leases, we
make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected
lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the
acquired in-place leases.

A
variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of
a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and buildings under
development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction
costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and
cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

We assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the



carrying
amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider market conditions, as well as our intent with
respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques; including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third party appraisals,
where considered necessary. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at least annually by applying the two-step approach. If the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying
value, then a second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment. The second step requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets
and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over
the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. We estimate the current fair value of the assets and liabilities in the
reporting unit through various valuation techniques; including applying capitalization rates to estimated segment net operating income, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, as necessary.
The fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company.

The
determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate
assets and reporting units, and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our ability to accurately predict future
operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions
may have a material impact on our financial results.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee's earnings or losses are included in our consolidated results of
operations.

The
initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to
the sale of interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value.
When we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is
recorded. The determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate,
the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, and other relevant factors. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit
spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. While we believe our assumptions
are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our
compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are



based
on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits
conducted by federal and state tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) the potential for built-in-gain recognized related to
prior-tax-free acquisitions of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included in income, other than adjustments to
income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations, which are adjusted through goodwill.

Results of Operations

We evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science,
(iii) medical office, (iv) post-acute/skilled nursing and (v) hospital. Under the senior housing, life science, post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital
segments, we invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties, through the acquisition and development of real estate, and by debt issued by operators in these sectors. Under the medical
office segment, we invest through the acquisition of MOBs that are primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of
property management. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements).

Subject
to closing the HCR ManorCare Acquisition (anticipated in March 2011), we expect to account for the leases of the 334 HCR ManorCare post-acute, skilled nursing
and assisted living facilities as DFLs. As a result, we expect significant increases in our income from DFLs. Further, a portion of the consideration for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition will be provided
by the reinvestment of our existing $1.72 billion (par value) debt investments in HCR ManorCare, which will result in a significant reduction of interest income in 2011.

On
January 14, 2011, we acquired our partner's 65% interest in HCP Ventures II, becoming the sole owner of the portfolio. During 2011, we expect increases in rental and
related revenues and decreases in investment management fee income as a result of acquiring our partner's interest in HCP Ventures II.

On
January 24, 2011, we issued $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes with a combined weighted average yield of 4.83%. As a result of the issuance of these senior unsecured
notes, we expect a significant increase in interest expense for 2011.

Senior housing.

The increase in senior housing rental and
related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to: (i) a $29.4 million increase as a result of including facility-level revenues for 27 properties as
a result of the consolidation of four VIEs from August 31, 2010 to November 1, 2010 (see Notes 12 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial



Statements
for additional information regarding these VIEs); (ii) a $7.6 million increase as a result of improved rental revenues related to the transition of properties to new operators
of 15 communities previously operated by Sunrise effective October 1, 2009; (iii) the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2010 and (iv) increases from rent escalations and
resets. The increase in senior housing rental and related revenues above was partially offset by income of $6.4 million in 2009 resulting from a correction to the purchase price allocation of
certain assets acquired in 2006.

•

Life science.

The increase in life science rental and
related revenues was primarily the result of assets that were placed in service in 2010, which were previously under development.

Income from direct financing leases.

Income from DFLs decreased $2.1 million to $49.4 million for the year ended
December 31,
2010. The decrease was primarily due to three DFLs that were deemed to be substantially impaired during 2009 (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Interest income.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, interest income increased $36.0 million to $160.2 million. The
increase
was primarily related to: (i) $30.4 million of additional interest earned from the purchase of a participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare in August 2009,
(ii) a $11 million of prepayment penalty upon the early repayment of a mortgage loan that was secured by a hospital, and (iii) $8.0 million of additional income earned from
the debt investments of Genesis purchased during 2010. These increases in interest income were partially offset by a $12.7 million decrease of interest earned from marketable debt securities
that were sold in 2009 and 2010. For a more detailed description of our mezzanine loan and participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR
ManorCare and Genesis, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate loans is partially mitigated by our variable rate
indebtedness. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

Investment management fee income.

Investment management fee income decreased $0.6 million to $4.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010.

Depreciation and amortization expense.

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $4.8 million to $312.0 million for
the year
ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily the result of lower depreciation from assets that were fully depreciated in 2009 and 2010, partially
offset by additional amortization expense from leasing costs and tenant and capital improvements expenditures that were incurred in 2009 and 2010, and increases due to our 2010 real estate
acquisitions.

Interest expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense decreased $10.2 million to $288.7 million. The
decrease
was primarily due to the decrease of: (i) $5.8 million from the net impact of the repayment of mortgage debt related to contractual maturities, partially offset by secured debt financing
obtained in connection with our purchase of a participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare, (ii) $4.6 million resulting from the repayment of our bridge loan in
May 2009 and term loan in March 2010, (iii) $2.9 million resulting from the repayment of $206 million of senior unsecured notes in 2010, and
(iv) $1.7 million resulting from the benefit of an interest-rate swap (pay float and receive fixed) that was placed on $250 million of our unsecured senior notes in
June 2009. The decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a decrease of $4.3 million of capitalized interest related to assets under development in our life science segment
that were placed in service during 2010.



Our exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our variable rate investments. For a more detailed discussion of
our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

Operating expenses are generally related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover all or a portion of those
expenses from the tenants. The presentation of expenses as operating or general and administrative is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of
expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses. The increase in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 was
primarily the result of including facility-level expenses for 27 properties as a result of the consolidation of four VIEs from August 31, 2010 to November 1, 2010 (see Notes 12
and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these VIEs).

General and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million to $83.0 million for the year
ended
December 31, 2010. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased costs related to acquisitions pursued in 2010, partially offset by a decrease in legal fees
associated with litigation matters and lower professional fees (see the



information
set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Litigation provision.

On September 4, 2009, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Ventas, Inc., in an action brought against
us in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for tortious interference with prospective business advantage in connection with Ventas' 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT. The jury
awarded Ventas approximately $102 million in compensatory damages, which we recorded as a litigation provision expense during 2009. We are seeking to have the judgment against us reversed. The
appeal and cross-appeal have now been fully briefed, and oral argument before the Court
of Appeals is scheduled for March 10, 2011 (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Impairments (recoveries).

The year ended December 31, 2010 includes $11.9 million related to the March 2010 reversal of
portions
of an allowance established by previous impairment charges of investments related to Erickson (discussed below). Erickson was the tenant at three of our senior housing
continuing-care-retirement-communities DFLs and the borrower of a senior construction loan in which we had a participation interest (see Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).

The
year ended December 31, 2009 includes impairments of $75.5 million as a result of (i) an aggregate $63.1 million provision related to DFL and loan losses
(impairment charges) related to the bankruptcy of Erickson who was the tenant at three of our senior housing CCRC DFLs and the borrower of a senior construction loan in which we had a
$10 million participation (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) $5.9 million of intangible assets on 12 of 15 senior housing communities that were
written off due to the termination of the Sunrise management agreements on 15 senior housing communities effective October 1, 2009, (iii) $4.3 million related to a senior secured
term loan as a result of an expected restructuring of terms to the loan following the default of the borrower in our hospital segment (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and
(iv) $2.2 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of a lease in our life science segment.

Other income, net.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, other income, net increased $8.1 million to $15.8 million. The
increase
was primarily a result of: (i) increases in gains on sales of marketable securities of $5.5 million and (ii) a $1.4 million of other-than-temporary
impairments of goodwill recognized in 2009. For a more detailed description of our marketable securities investments, see Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income taxes.

Income taxes decreased $1.5 million to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in
income
taxes is primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from the election of one of our former taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") to become a REIT in 2010.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, equity income from unconsolidated joint
ventures
increased $1.3 million to $4.8 million. This increase is primarily due to: (i) the recognition of additional rental revenues during 2010 from a life science tenant in one of our
unconsolidated joint ventures that was previously deferred and (ii) a change in the expected useful life of certain intangible assets of one of our unconsolidated joint ventures that resulted
in lower equity income due to higher amounts of amortization expense during 2009. These increases were partially offset by HCP Ventures II's conclusion to cease recognizing non-cash
rental income (i.e., straight-line rents) from Horizon Bay effective July 1, 2010, which resulted in lower earnings for, and our share of earnings from, HCP
Ventures II during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized impairments of
$71.7 million related to our 35% interest in HCP Ventures II, an unconsolidated joint venture that owns 25 senior housing properties leased by Horizon Bay as a result



of
the recent and projected deterioration of the operating performance of the properties leased by Horizon Bay from HCP Ventures II.

Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $22.8 million, compared
to
$45 million for the comparable period in 2009. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of $17.4 million and a decline in operating income from
discontinued operations of $4.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 14 properties for $56 million, compared to 14 properties for $72 million for the
year ended December 31, 2009.

Senior housing.

Senior housing rental and related revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes $6.4 million resulting from an adjustment to the purchase price allocation of certain assets acquired in 2006. No similar adjustments were
made in the year ended December 31, 2008. As a result of the transfer of an 11-property senior housing portfolio to Emeritus on December 1, 2008, our rental revenues
increased by $9.8 million primarily related to new leases with Emeritus. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $7.4 million related to 2008 additional rents
from property level expense credits related to our properties operated by Sunrise and (ii) a $7.3 million decrease in the facility-level operating revenues for three senior housing
properties that were previously under management agreements and re-leased on a triple-net basis during 2009.

•

Life science.

The increase in life science rental and
related revenues was primarily a result of (i) a net increase of $14.9 million from lease-up activities that were partially offset by vacancies, and (ii) a
$6.7 million net increase from development assets placed in service during 2008 that were partially offset by assets placed in redevelopment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
of $14.7 million in lease termination fees.

Income from direct financing leases.

Income from DFLs decreased $6.7 million to $51.5 million for the year ended
December 31,
2009. The decrease was primarily due to three DFLs that during 2009 were deemed to be substantially impaired. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest income.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income decreased $6.7 million to $124.1 million. This
decrease
was primarily related to a decline in LIBOR resulting in a decrease of interest earned on our mezzanine variable-rate loans, which was partially offset by additional interest income earned
from the purchase of a participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare in August 2009. For a more detailed description of our mezzanine loan and participation in the first mortgage
debt of HCR ManorCare, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate loans is partially mitigated by our variable rate
indebtedness. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

Depreciation and amortization expense.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $4.7 million to $316.7 million for
the year
ended December 31, 2009. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to a $3.3 million increase due to the purchase in September 2008 of Tenet's
noncontrolling interest in Health Care Property Partners, a joint venture between HCP and an affiliate of Tenet, and an increase of $2.0 million resulting from an adjustment to the purchase
price allocation related to certain assets acquired in 2006 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Interest expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense decreased $49.5 million to $298.9 million. The
decrease
was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $45.7 million from the decline in LIBOR and the repayment of the outstanding balance under our bridge loan and revolving line of
credit facility, and (ii) a decrease of $8.3 million resulting from the repayment of $300 million of senior unsecured floating rate notes in September 2008. These decreases
in interest expense were partially offset by an increase of $5.2 million from the net impact of mortgage debt placed on senior housing assets in 2008 and the repayment of mortgage debt related
to contractual maturities.

Our
exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our variable rate investments. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk,

Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover all or a portion of those
expenses under the respective leases. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and
administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions that we believe improve the
quality of our presentation.

•

General and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $4.8 million to $78.5 million for the year
ended
December 31, 2009. The increase in general and administrative expenses
was primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with litigation matters partially offset by lower compensation related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, in
relation to the Ventas litigation matter, we incurred legal expenses of $13.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings"
of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Litigation provision.

On September 4, 2009, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Ventas in an action brought against us in the
United States
District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for tortious interference with prospective business advantage in connection with Ventas' 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT. The jury awarded Ventas
approximately $102 million in compensatory damages, which we recorded as a litigation provision expense during 2009 (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Impairments (recoveries).

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized impairments of $75.5 million as a result of
(i) an aggregate $63.1 million provision related to DFL and loan losses (impairment charges) related to the bankruptcy of Erickson who was the tenant at three of our senior housing CCRC
DFLs and the borrower of a senior construction loan in which we had a $10 million participation (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (ii) $5.9 million
of intangible assets on 12 of 15 senior housing communities that were written off due to the termination of the Sunrise management agreements on 15 senior housing communities effective
October 1, 2009, (iii) $4.3 million related to a senior secured term loan as a result of an expected restructuring of terms to the loan following the default of the borrower in
our hospital segment (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (iv) $2.2 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of a lease in
our life science segment.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized impairments of $27.5 million as follows: (i) $12.0 million related to intangible assets associated with
the transfer of an 11-property senior housing portfolio, (ii) $3.7 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of three leases in the life
science segment, (iii) $1.0 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of two leases in the hospital segment, (iv) $1.6 million related to
two senior housing facilities as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows, and (v) $9.2 million, included in discontinued operations, related to the decrease in expected cash flows
and anticipated dispositions of two senior housing properties and one hospital.

Other income, net.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, other income, net decreased $17.9 million to $7.8 million. This
decrease was primarily related to the $28.6 million of income related to the 2008 settlement of litigation with Tenet and a $2.4 million gain on the early repayment of debt. The decrease
was partially offset by increases in gains on marketable debt securities of $8.6 million and a reduction of $7.3 million of other-than-temporary impairments on
marketable equity
securities. For a more detailed description of our marketable securities investments, see Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income taxes.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, income taxes decreased $2.3 million to $1.9 million. This decrease
is
primarily due to: (i) lower interest earned, due to a decline in LIBOR, for a portion of one of our mezzanine loans, (ii) the transfer of a loan investment out of one of our TRS and
(iii) increased depreciation expense, due to a correction of an immaterial error for one of our real estate investments held in a TRS.

Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $45 million, compared
to
$246.5 million for the comparable period in 2008. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of $191.9 million and a decline in



operating
income from discontinued operations of $18.7 million, partially offset by a reduction of impairment charges in discontinued operations of $9.1 million. During the year ended
December 31, 2009, we sold 14 properties for $72 million, as compared to 51 properties for $643 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Noncontrolling interests' share in earnings.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, noncontrolling interests' share in earnings
decreased
$8.0 million to $14.5 million. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a $4 million decrease related to the conversions of 3.3 million DownREIT units that converted
into shares of our common stock during 2008 and 2009, and (ii) a $4 million decrease related to purchases of other noncontrolling interests during 2008 and 2009.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund recurring operating expenses, (ii) meet debt service requirements,
including $292 million of senior unsecured notes and $58 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2011, (iii) fund capital expenditures, including tenant
improvements and leasing costs, (iv) fund acquisition and development activities, and (v) make dividend distributions. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated
by operations and from our various financing activities during the next twelve months. During the year ended
December 31, 2010, distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders exceeded cash flows from operations by approximately $26 million. During 2010, we raised aggregate
net proceeds of $2.6 billion from issuances of common stock and sales of marketable securities and real estate, which proceeds, among other things, were the sources of cash used to fund the
excess of distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders above cash flows from operations during the year ended December 31, 2010.

We
intend to pay the $3.53 billion cash portion of the consideration for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition primarily with the proceeds from our $1.472 billion
December 2010 common stock offering and $2.4 billion January 2011 senior unsecured note offering.

Access
to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the
issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. For example, as noted below, our revolving line
of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings. We also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon
our debt ratings. As of January 31, 2011, we had a credit rating of Baa2 (stable) from Moody's, BBB (stable) from S&P and BBB (watch positive) from Fitch on our senior unsecured debt
securities, and Baa3 (stable) from Moody's, BB+ (stable) from S&P and BB+ (watch positive) from Fitch on our preferred equity securities.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $580 million and $516 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in operating
cash flows is primarily the result of the following: (i) the additive impact of our investments in 2009 and 2010, (ii) assets placed in service in 2010 and (iii) rent escalations
and resets in 2009 and 2010. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi-tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease
obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors.

Net
cash used by investing activities was $431 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and consisted of the net effects of funding: (i) $305 million for
acquisition and development of real estate, (ii) $298 million for investments in loans receivables and DFLs, and (iii) $98 million for leasing costs and tenant and capital
improvements. These expenditures were partially offset by our proceeds of $179 million from the sales of marketable debt securities and $32 million from the repayment of loans receivable
and DFLs.



Net
cash provided by financing activities was $775 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and consisted primarily of net proceeds of $2.4 billion from the
issuances of common stock. The amount of
cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by or used for the: (i) repayment of our mortgage and other secured debt of $636 million, (ii) payments of common and
preferred dividends aggregating $591 million, (iii) repayment of $206 million of senior unsecured notes, and (iv) repayment of our term loan of $200 million.

Debt

Bank line of credit.

Our revolving line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of
$1.5 billion and matures on August 1, 2011. This revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings.
We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings. Based on our debt ratings at December 31, 2010, the margin on the revolving line of credit facility
was 0.55% and the facility fee was 0.15%. At December 31, 2010, we had no amounts drawn under this revolving line of credit facility. At December 31, 2010, $113 million of
aggregate letters of credit were outstanding against our revolving line of credit facility, including a $103 million letter of credit as a result of the Ventas litigation. For further
information regarding the Ventas litigation see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our
revolving line of credit facility contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement,
(i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%,
(iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75 times and (iv) require a formula-determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $6.9 billion at
December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of our revolving line of credit facility.

Our
revolving line of credit facility also contains cross-default provisions to other indebtedness of ours, including in some instances, certain mortgages on our properties. Certain
mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants, including default provisions relating to
the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs, such a default
may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences.

Senior unsecured notes.

At December 31, 2010, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of
$3.3 billion. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 1.27% to 7.12% with a weighted average effective rate of 6.19% at December 31, 2010. Discounts and premiums are amortized to
interest expense over the term of the related notes. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt, cross-acceleration provisions and other customary terms. At
December 31, 2010, we believe we were in compliance with these covenants.

On
January 24, 2011, we issued $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes as follows: (i) $400 million of 2.70% notes due 2014; (ii) $500 million of
3.75% notes due 2016; (iii) $1.2 billion of 5.375% notes due 2021; and (iv) $300 million of 6.75% notes due 2041. The notes have a weighted average maturity of
10.3 years and a weighted average yield of 4.83%. The net proceeds of the offering were $2.37 billion. If the HCR ManorCare Acquisition is not completed by June 13, 2011 (under
certain conditions permitted under the purchase agreement this date may be extended to September 13, 2011), we are required to redeem all of these senior unsecured notes at 101% of the
principal amount 20 business days subsequent to the earlier of such date or the date that the purchase agreement is terminated.



Mortgage and other secured debt.

At December 31, 2010, we had $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt
secured by
138 healthcare facilities, which had a carrying amount of $2.0 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 1.96% to 8.30% with a weighted average effective interest rate of 6.14%
at December 31, 2010.

Mortgage
debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by certain properties and is generally non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically
restricts transfer of the encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the properties in good condition,
requires maintenance of insurance on the properties and includes requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also
cross-collateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such properties.

Other debt.

At December 31, 2010, we had $92.2 million of non-interest bearing life care bonds at two of our CCRCs and
non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of our senior housing facility, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively,
"Life Care Bonds"). At December 31, 2010, $35.9 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death, and
$56.3 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident.

Equity

At December 31, 2010, we had 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock,
7.8 million shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 370.9 million shares of common stock outstanding. At December 31, 2010, equity totaled
$8.1 billion and our equity securities had a market value of $14.2 billion.

As
of December 31, 2010, there were a total of 4.2 million DownREIT units outstanding in five limited liability companies in which we are the managing member. The DownREIT
units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain
adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications).

Shelf Registration

We have a prospectus on file with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S-3, using a shelf
registration process that expires in September 2012. Under this "shelf" process, we may sell from time to time any combination of the registered securities in one or more offerings. The securities
described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Each time we sell securities under the shelf registration, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will
contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of
the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be
used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, working capital and potential acquisitions.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure—Funds From Operations ("FFO")

We believe FFO applicable to common shares, diluted FFO applicable to common shares, FFO, before the impact of impairments, recoveries
and litigation provision, and basic and diluted FFO per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost
accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust



that
uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.

FFO
is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and
amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO
reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition or that have a
different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from us. In addition, we present FFO, before the impact of impairments, recoveries, merger-related items and litigation provision ("FFO as
adjusted"). Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net
income.

Details
of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financials results summary of our financial results for the year months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008. The following is a reconciliation from net income applicable to common shares, the most direct comparable financial measure calculated and presented with GAAP, to FFO (dollars and shares in

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as
collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included. Our risk of loss for these
properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity
and capital resources except those described below under "Contractual Obligations."

Inflation

Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other
measures, and/or additional rent based on increases in the tenants' operating revenues. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real
estate taxes, insurance and utilities. Substantially all of our senior housing, life science, post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of
the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and
contractual rent increases described above.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards. There were no accounting
pronouncements that were issued, but not yet adopted by us, that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

At December 31, 2010, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately
$1.3 billion of variable-rate loan investments (excludes $500 million of variable-rate loan investments that have been hedged through interest-rate
swap contracts) and $83 million of other investments where the payments fluctuate with changes in LIBOR. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding our loan investments. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable-rate investments is partially offset by (i) $31 million of
variable-rate mortgage notes debt payable (excludes $88 million of variable-rate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interest-rate swap contracts),
(ii) $25 million of variable-rate senior unsecured notes and (iii) $250 million of additional variable interest-rate exposure achieved through an
interest-rate swap contract (pay float and receive fixed).

Interest
rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and loans receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise
terminated. However,
interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash
flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable-rate investments and
variable-rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2010, net interest income would improve by approximately $10.5 million or $0.03 per
common share on a diluted basis. Assuming a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates under the above circumstances and taking into consideration that the index underlying many of our arrangements is
currently below 50 basis points and is not expected to go below zero, net interest income would decline by $5.2 million, or less than $0.02 per common share on a diluted basis.

We
use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

To
illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments. We applied various basis point spreads, to the
underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments' change in fair value. Assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve,
the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed $4.0 million. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
analysis details.



The
principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value for our senior
unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices. The fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates
for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.

ITEM 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be
disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), to allow for timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures.

Also,
we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain
with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer
(Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of
December 31, 2010, at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2010 to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonable
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

,
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of HCP, Inc.

Long Beach, California

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, of the Company and our report dated February 15, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
financial statement schedules.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of HCP, Inc.

Long Beach, California

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2010, and the related consolidated statements
of income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Our audit also included the financial statement schedules for the year ended December 31, 2010 listed in the Index at Item 15.
These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)   Business

HCP, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a Maryland corporation that is organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, together
with its consolidated entities (collectively, "HCP" or the "Company"), invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. The Company acquires, develops, leases,
manages and disposes of healthcare real estate and provides financing to healthcare providers.

(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

Management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from management's estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures or variable
interest entities that it controls through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

The
Company is required to continually evaluate its variable interest entity ("VIE") relationships and consolidate investments in these entities when it is determined to be the primary
beneficiary of their operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the
activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without
additional subordinated financial support.

A
variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact
the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company
qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, the Company's ability to direct the activities that
most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability
and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity.

For
its investments in joint ventures, the Company evaluates the type of ownership rights held by the limited partner(s) that may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the
sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership. The assessment of limited partners' rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the
sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of
the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of
outstanding limited partnership interests. The Company similarly evaluates the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes rental revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is
reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, the Company recognizes revenue upon acquisition of the
asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements,
for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or the Company. When the Company is the owner of the tenant
improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the
tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded by the Company is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease
term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to, the following criterion:

•

whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;

•

whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;

•

whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and

•

whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term.

Certain
leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized
when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized only after the contingency has been removed (when the
related thresholds are achieved), which may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received.

Tenant
recoveries related to the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses
are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented gross, as the Company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, has
discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk.

For
leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, the Company recognizes income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured.
Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in recognized
revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If the Company determines that collectibility of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, the Company
limits future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, establishes an allowance for estimated losses.

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or
the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. The Company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This
evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, the Company's assessment is based on
amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.

The
Company receives management fees from its investments in certain joint venture entities for various services it provides as the managing member of these entities. Management fees are
recorded as revenue when management services have been performed. Intercompany profit for management fees is eliminated.

The
Company recognizes gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when the
collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, the Company is not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant, the initial investment from the buyer is
sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.

The
Company uses the direct finance method of accounting to record income from direct financing leases ("DFLs"). For leases accounted for as DFLs, the future minimum lease payments are
recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and estimated residual values, less the cost of the properties, is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is
deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized
and unearned income.

Loans
receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Loans
held-for-investment are carried at amortized cost and are reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses as necessary. The Company recognizes interest income
on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is applied on a loan-by-loan basis when
collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans. Loans are transferred from
held-for-investment to held for sale when management's intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost
or fair value.

Allowances
are established for loans and DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is
deemed probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. An allowance is based upon the Company's assessment of the
borrower's or lessee's overall financial condition; resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of
any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's or DFL's effective interest rate, fair value of
collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors, as appropriate.

Loans
and DFLs are placed on non-accrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on
non-accrual status, loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, in which all
cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or DFL, based on the Company's expectation of future collectibility.

Real Estate

The Company's real estate assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. Costs are allocated at
acquisition, including the assumption of liabilities, to the acquired tangible assets and identifiable intangibles based on their fair value. The Company assesses fair value based on

F-11


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

cash
flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including
historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, as well as market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property is based on the value of the property
as if it is vacant.

The
Company records acquired "above and below market" leases at their fair value using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is
based on the
present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for
each in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with bargain renewal
options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease.
Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs,
the Company includes estimates of lost rents at estimated market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions and expected
trends. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.

The
Company capitalizes direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to
the acquisition, development or construction of a real estate asset. The Company capitalizes construction and development costs while substantive activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its
intended use. The Company considers a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from
cessation of significant construction activity. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, or after development activities have ceased, are expensed as
incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the Company capitalizes costs based on the net carrying value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the
construction and improvement incurred in connection with the redevelopment. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings. Expenditures for
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company considers costs incurred in conjunction with re-leasing properties, including tenant improvements and lease commissions, to
represent the acquisition of productive assets and, accordingly, such costs are reflected as investing activities in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.

The
Company computes depreciation on properties using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful life. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is
identified as held for sale. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over useful lives ranging up to 45 years. Above and below market lease intangibles are amortized primarily to revenue
over the remaining noncancellable lease terms and bargain renewal periods, if any. Other in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining noncancellable lease term
and bargain renewal periods, if any.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company tests its real estate assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the
expected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the real estate

F-12


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

asset
or asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the carrying value of the real estate assets to its fair
value.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever the Company identifies triggering events that may indicate an impairment has occurred by applying a two-step
approach. Potential impairment indicators include a significant decline in real estate valuations, restructuring plans or a significant decline in the value of the Company's market capitalization. The
Company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the
test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment. The second step requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting
unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied
value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. The Company selected the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to perform its annual impairment test.

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

Certain long-lived assets are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their
fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. Discontinued operations is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is deemed to be held for sale if, (i) the
operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction, and (ii) the entity will not have any significant
continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which the Company does not consolidate but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company's share of the investee's earnings or losses are included in the Company's
consolidated results of operations.

The
initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the fair value of the assets prior to the
sale of interests in the joint venture. To the extent that the Company's cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is generally amortized over
the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in the Company's share of equity in earnings of the joint venture. The Company evaluates its equity method
investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When the Company determines a decline in the fair value of an investment in
an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. The Company recognizes gains on the sale of interests in joint
ventures to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

The
Company's fair values for its equity method investments are based on discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period
and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums or discounts. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon assumptions that the Company believes
to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense for share-based awards granted to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are
recognized in the statements of income based on their fair market value. Compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules is generally recognized ratably over the period from the grant
date to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional services.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less when
purchased.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts held by mortgage lenders to provide for (i) real estate tax expenditures, tenant
improvements and capital expenditures, and (ii) security deposits and net proceeds from property sales that were executed as tax-deferred dispositions.

Derivatives

During its normal course of business, the Company uses certain types of derivative instruments for the purpose of managing interest
rate risk. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivative instruments used for risk management purposes must effectively reduce the risk exposure that they are designed to hedge. In addition, at
inception of a qualifying cash flow hedging relationship, the underlying transaction or transactions, must be, and are expected to remain, probable of occurring in accordance with the Company's
related assertions.

The
Company recognizes all derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives required to be bifurcated, as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair
value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the criteria of hedge accounting are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated
in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships, the change in fair value of the effective portion of the derivatives is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), whereas the change
in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships, the change in fair value of the effective portion of the
derivatives offsets the change in fair value of the hedged item, whereas the change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings.

The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions. This process includes designating all derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship to specific forecasted transactions as well as recognized obligations or assets in the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company also assesses and documents, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives that are designated in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the designated risks associated with the respective hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective as a
hedge, or that it is probable the underlying forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and records the appropriate adjustment to earnings based on
the current fair value of the derivative.

Income Taxes

In 1985, HCP, Inc. elected REIT status and believes it has always operated so as to continue to qualify as a REIT under
Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Accordingly, HCP, Inc. will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that it continues to
qualify as a REIT and makes distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of its taxable income. On July 27, 2007, the Company formed HCP Life Science REIT, a consolidated subsidiary,
which elected REIT status for the year ended December 31, 2007. HCP, Inc. and its consolidated REIT subsidiary are each subject to the REIT qualification requirements under
Sections 856 to 860 of the Code. If either REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may be ineligible to
qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years.

HCP, Inc.
and HCP Life Science REIT are subject to state and local income taxes in some jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances each REIT may also be subject to federal excise
taxes on undistributed income. In addition, certain activities the Company undertakes must be conducted by entities which elect to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). TRSs are subject to
both federal and state income taxes. The Company recognizes tax penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as additional tax expense. Interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized
as interest expense.

Marketable Securities

The Company classifies its marketable equity and debt securities as available-for-sale. These securities are
carried at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses on securities sold are
determined based on the specific identification method. When the Company determines declines in fair value of marketable securities are other-than-temporary, a loss is
recognized in earnings.

Capital Raising Issuance Costs

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of common shares are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of preferred shares are recorded as a reduction of the preferred stock amount. Debt issuance costs are deferred, included in other assets and amortized
to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt based on the interest method.

Segment Reporting

The Company's segments are based on its internal method of reporting which classifies operations by healthcare sector. The Company's
business operations include five segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical office, (iv) post-acute/skilled nursing and (v) hospital.

Noncontrolling Interests

The Company reports arrangements with noncontrolling interests as a component of equity separate from the parent's equity. The Company
accounts for purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in
consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated statements of income and, upon a gain or loss of control, the interest purchased or
sold, as well as any interest retained, is recorded at its fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.

F-15


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
Company consolidates non-managing member limited liability companies ("DownREITs") since it exercises control, and noncontrolling interests in these entities are carried
at cost. The non-managing member LLC Units ("DownREIT units") are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of the
Company's common stock or, at the Company's option, shares of the Company's common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). Upon exchange of DownREIT units
for the Company's common stock, the carrying amount of the DownREIT units is reclassified to stockholders' equity.

Preferred Stock Redemptions

The Company recognizes the excess of the redemption value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock redeemed over its carrying amount as
a charge to earnings. The Company reduces the carrying value of preferred shares by the amount of original issuance costs (see Note 13).

Life Care Bonds Payable

Two of the Company's continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs") issue non-interest bearing life care bonds payable to
certain residents of the CCRCs. Generally, the bonds are refundable to the resident or to the resident's estate upon termination or cancellation of the CCRC agreement. An additional senior housing
facility owned by the Company collects non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits that are refundable to the resident or the resident's estate upon the earlier of the
re-letting of the unit or after two years of vacancy. Proceeds from the issuance of new bonds are used to retire existing bonds, and since the maturity of the obligations for the three
facilities is not determinable, no interest is imputed. These amounts are included in other debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Fair Value Measurement

The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of
valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from
independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These inputs have created the
following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1

—quoted prices for

identical

instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2

—quoted prices for

similar

instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical
or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations
in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and

•

Level 3

—fair value measurements derived from valuation
techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are

unobservable

.

The
Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value. When
available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1. In some instances where a market price
is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and classifies the
asset or liability in Level 2.

F-16


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

If
quoted market prices or inputs are not available, fair value measurements are based upon valuation models that utilize current market or independently sourced market inputs, such as
interest rates, option volatilities, credit spreads and/or market capitalization rates. Items valued using such internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are
readily observable. Internal fair value models and techniques used by the Company include discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes valuation models. The Company also considers its counterparty's and own
credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at their fair value. The Company has elected the mid-market pricing expedient when determining fair value.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company accounts for unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(whether paid or unpaid) as participating securities, which are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Diluted earnings per common share is
calculated by including the effect of dilutive and preferred securities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

. The amendments in this update require, among
other things, new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures related to transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, further disaggregation of fair
value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and additional details of valuation techniques and inputs utilized. This update is consistent with the Company's current
accounting application for fair value measurements and disclosures and did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In
July 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-20,

Receivables (Topic 310): Disclosures about the Credit Quality of
Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses

. The amendments in this update require additional disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables, such
as aging information and credit quality indicators. Both new and existing disclosures must be disaggregated by portfolio segment or class. The disaggregation of information is based on how allowances
for credit losses are developed and how credit exposure is managed. This update is effective for interim periods and fiscal years ending after December 15, 2010. The adoption of
these requirements on December 31, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the Company's consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation. Assets sold or held for sale and associated liabilities have been reclassified on the consolidated balance sheets and operating results reclassified from continuing to
discontinued operations. All prior period interest income and interest expense have been reclassified to be presented as components of "revenues" and "costs and expenses," respectively, on the
consolidated statements of income as a result of a significant increase in the Company's lending operations.

(5)   HCR ManorCare Acquisition

On December 13, 2010, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the real estate assets of HCR ManorCare, Inc. ("HCR
ManorCare"), for a purchase price of $6.1 billion ("HCR ManorCare Acquisition"). The consideration for the purchase will consist of the following: (i) $3.528 billion in cash;
(ii) $1.72 billion par value (carrying value of $1.6 billion) reinvestment of HCP's existing mezzanine and mortgage loan investments in HCR ManorCare (see Note 7); and
(iii) subject to certain adjustments, 25.7 million shares of HCP common stock to be issued directly to the shareholders of HCR ManorCare, or, at the Company's option, a cash equivalent
of $852 million.

Upon
closing, the Company will acquire 334 HCR ManorCare post-acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The facilities are located in 30 states, with the highest
concentrations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois and Michigan. A wholly-owned subsidiary of HCR ManorCare will continue to operate the assets pursuant to a long-term
triple-net master lease supported by a guaranty from HCR ManorCare.

Concurrent
with the signing of the definitive agreement for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, the Company obtained a bridge loan commitment from a syndicate of banks of up to
$3.3 billion. As a result of the Company's December 2010 common stock and January 2011 senior unsecured note offerings, the amount available under this bridge loan commitment has
been reduced to approximately $90 million.

In
connection with the HCR ManorCare Acquisition prefunding activities, on January 31, 2011, the Company purchased an additional $360 million participation in the first
mortgage debt of HCR
ManorCare. This transaction increased the Company's debt investments in HCR ManorCare to an aggregate par value of $2.08 billion.

Properties subject to direct financing leases



Certain leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the
aggregate initial investment amount plus adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements. Certain leases also permit the Company to require the tenants to purchase the properties at the end of
the lease terms.

Lease
payments previously due to the Company relating to three land-only DFLs, along with the land, were subordinate to and served as collateral for first mortgage
construction loans entered into by Erickson Retirement Communities and its affiliate entities ("Erickson") to fund development costs related to the properties. On October 19, 2009, Erickson
filed for bankruptcy protection, which included a plan of reorganization.

On
December 23, 2009, an auction was concluded with respect to Erickson's assets, and on December 30, 2009, Erickson filed an amended plan of reorganization providing
additional detail about the results of the auction and the allocation of auction proceeds. The amended plan proposed that the Company would not be entitled to any of the proceeds with respect to the
three DFLs, but would receive a nominal recovery with respect to the Company's participation in the senior construction loan. Additionally, on January 4, 2010, Erickson served the Company with
adversary complaints claiming, among other things, that the Company's interest as a landlord under the DFLs should be treated as if it were instead the interest of a lender with a security interest in
the properties. Even though Erickson's amended plan of reorganization had not been confirmed in the bankruptcy proceedings, the Company concluded that, as a result of the auction, the subsequent
allocation of the auction proceeds and management's evaluation of Erickson's pursuit of remedies consistent with the extinguishment of the Company's DFL interests, it was appropriate to reduce the
carrying value of these assets to a nominal amount associated with the expected partial recovery of the participation interest in the senior construction loan.

In
February 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Erickson which was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court. In April 2010, the reorganization
was completed, which resulted in the Company (i) retaining deposits held by the Company with balances of $5 million and (ii) receiving an additional $9.6 million. As a
result, during the three months ended March 31, 2010, the Company recognized aggregate income of $11.9 million in impairment recoveries, which represented the reversal of a portion of
the allowances established pursuant to the previous impairment charges related to its investments in the three DFLs and participation interest in the senior construction loan. This amount is shown as
impairments (recoveries) in the consolidated statements of income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

At December 31, 2010, minimum future principal payments to be received on loans receivable, including those secured by real estate, are
$90 million in 2011, $0.6 million in 2012, $1.727 billion in 2013, $329 million in 2014 and $22 million in 2015.

The
Company holds an interest-only, senior secured term loan made to an affiliate of the Cirrus Group, LLC ("Cirrus"). The loan had a maturity date of
December 31, 2008, with a one-year extension period at the option of the borrower, subject to certain terms and conditions, under which amounts were borrowed to finance the
acquisition, development, syndication and operation of new and existing surgical partnerships. The loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the borrower (comprised primarily of interests in
partnerships operating surgical facilities, some of which are on the premises of properties owned by the Company or HCP Ventures IV, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture of the Company)
and is supported in part by limited guarantees made by certain principals of Cirrus. Recourse under certain of these guarantees is limited to the guarantors' respective interests in certain entities
owning real estate that are pledged to secure such guarantees. At December 31, 2008, the borrower did not meet the conditions necessary to exercise its extension option and did not repay the
loan upon maturity. On April 22, 2009, new terms for extending the maturity date of the loan were agreed to, including the payment of a $1.1 million extension fee, and the maturity date
was extended to December 31, 2010. In July 2009, the Company issued a notice of default for the borrower's failure to make interest payments. In December 2009, the Company
determined that the loan was impaired and recognized a provision for loan loss of $4.3 million. This provision for loan loss resulted from discussions that began in December 2009 to
restructure the loan. The proposed terms of the restructure (effective February 1, 2010) bifurcates the loan into two tranches and modifies the related terms as follows:
(i) tranche A is $39 million and accrues interest at a rate of 14%, of which 9.5% is payable quarterly and 4.5% is deferred until maturity in January 2012; and
(ii) tranche B is $52 million and accrues interest at a rate of 8.5% (previously 14%); Cirrus may defer its interest payments on this tranche to the maturity of the loan in
July 2012 to the extent that it does not generate excess cash flows from the related operations. The Company believes that the value of the collateral supporting this loan exceeds the amount
due and expects full repayment of its loan to Cirrus. Cirrus is in the process of marketing certain of the collateral assets for sale as a means of paying off the loan. Should the borrower be
unsuccessful in selling the collateral assets and other sources of repayment are inadequate, the Company could be required to further modify this loan or take possession of the collateral. At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of this loan, including accrued interest of $7.2 million and $5.2 million, respectively, was $93.1 million and
$83.5 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized interest income from this loan of $11.7 million and $11.2 million,
respectively, and received cash payments from the borrower of $1.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively.

On
December 21, 2007, the Company made an investment in mezzanine loans having an aggregate par value of $1.0 billion at a discount of $100 million, which resulted
in an acquisition cost of $900 million, as part of the financing for The Carlyle Group's $6.3 billion purchase of Manor Care, Inc. These interest-only loans mature in
January 2013 and bear interest on their par values at a floating rate of one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 4.0%. These loans are mandatorily
pre-payable in January 2012 unless the borrower satisfies certain performance conditions. Among other things, these performance conditions require the borrower to:
(i) maintain an interest-rate cap agreement(s) with a strike price of 5.25% at an equivalent maturity to that of the underlying loans; and (ii) maintain a
trailing-twelve-month Debt Service Coverage Ratio, as defined in the respective agreement, of no less than 1.45 times. The loans are secured by an indirect pledge of equity ownership in 334 HCR
ManorCare facilities located in 30 states and were subordinate to other debt of

approximately
$3.6 billion. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of these loans was $953 million and $934 million, respectively.

On
August 3, 2009, the Company purchased a $720 million participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare at a discount of $130 million, which resulted in an
acquisition cost of $590 million. The $720 million participation bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% and represents 45% of the $1.6 billion most senior tranche of HCR ManorCare's
mortgage debt incurred as part of the above mentioned financing for The Carlyle Group's acquisition of Manor Care, Inc. in December 2007. The mortgage debt matures in
January 2013, if the borrower exercises a one-year extension option and meets certain performance conditions, which are similar to those described above. The mortgage debt is
secured by a first lien on 334 facilities located in 30 states. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of the participation in this loan was $639 million and
$604 million, respectively.

On
December 13, 2010, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the real estate assets of HCR ManorCare, Inc. for a purchase price of
$6.1 billion. Upon closing, the Company's investments in debt issued by HCR ManorCare discussed above ($1.72 billion aggregate par value) will be extinguished. See Note 5 for
additional discussion on the HCR ManorCare Acquisition.

In
September and October 2010 the Company purchased participations in a senior loan and mezzanine note of Genesis Healthcare ("Genesis") with par values of $277.6 million
and $50.0 million, respectively, each at a discount for $249.9 million and $40.0 million, respectively. These investments represent a portion of the $1.67 billion of debt
incurred in connection with the $2.0 billion acquisition of Genesis in July 2007. At December 31, 2010, the carrying values of the senior loan and mezzanine note were
$252 million and $41 million, respectively.

The
Genesis senior loan bears interest on the par value at LIBOR (subject to a current floor of 1.5% increasing to 2.5% by maturity) plus a spread of 4.75% increasing to 5.75% by
maturity. The senior loan is prepayable anytime without penalty, matures in September 2014 and is secured by all of Genesis' assets. The mezzanine note bears interest on the par value at LIBOR
plus a spread of 7.50% and
matures in September 2014. In addition to the coupon interest payments, the mezzanine note requires the payment of a termination fee, of which the Company's share at December 31, 2010
was $2 million, increasing to a maximum of $5 million if the debt is repaid in full at maturity. The mezzanine note is subordinate to the senior loan and secured by an indirect pledge of
equity ownership in Genesis' assets. At December 31, 2010, the coupon rates on the senior loan and mezzanine note were 6.25% and 7.76% respectively.

On
November 1, 2010, upon the early repayment of a mortgage loan receivable, the Company received $46 million in proceeds, recognizing additional interest income of
$11 million for the prepayment premium included in the proceeds. This loan was secured by a hospital, had an original maturity of January 2016 and carried an interest rate of 8.5%.

On
January 14, 2011, the Company acquired its partner's 65% interest in HCP Ventures II, becoming the sole owner of the portfolio. At closing,
the Company paid approximately $137 million in cash for the interest and assumed its partner's share of approximately $650 million of debt (par value) secured by the real estate assets.
This transaction valued the venture's real estate assets at approximately $860 million. The consolidation of HCP Ventures II on January 14, 2011 resulted in a gain of
approximately $8 million, which gain represents the fair value of HCP's 35% interest in this venture in excess of its carrying value on the acquisition date.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, intangible lease assets, comprised of lease-up intangibles, above market tenant lease intangibles, below market
ground lease intangibles and intangible assets related to non-compete agreements, were $511.4 million and $592.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
the accumulated amortization of intangible assets was $195.0 million and $202.4 million, respectively. The remaining weighted average amortization period of intangible assets was

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, rental income includes additional revenues of $8.2 million, $16.4 million and
$9.0 million, respectively, from the amortization of net below market lease intangibles. For each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, operating expenses include
additional expense of $0.4 million from the amortization of net above market ground lease intangibles. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, depreciation and amortization
expense includes additional expense of $45.7 million, $63.3 million and $74.0 million, respectively, from the amortization of lease-up and non-compete
agreement intangibles.

On
October 5, 2006, the Company acquired CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. ("CRP") in a merger. Through the purchase method of accounting, the Company allocated
$35 million of above-market lease intangibles related to 15 senior housing facilities that were operated by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Sunrise"). In
June 2009, in a subsequent review of the related calculations of the relative fair value of these lease intangibles, the Company noted valuation errors, which resulted in an aggregate
overstatement of the above-market lease intangible assets and an aggregate understatement of building and improvements of $28 million. In the periods from October 5, 2006 through
March 31, 2009, these errors resulted in an understatement of rental and related revenues and depreciation expense of approximately $6 million and $2 million, respectively. The
Company recorded the related corrections in June 2009, and determined that such misstatements to the Company's results of operations or financial position during the periods from
October 5, 2006 through June 30, 2009 were immaterial.

(11) Debt

Bank Line of Credit and Term and Bridge Loans

The Company's revolving line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of
$1.5 billion and matures on August 1, 2011. This revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.325% to 1.00%,
depending upon the Company's debt ratings. The Company pays a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, depending upon its debt ratings. Based on the Company's debt
ratings at December 31, 2010, the margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 0.55% and the facility fee was 0.15%. At December 31, 2010, the Company had no amounts drawn under
this revolving line of credit facility. At December 31, 2010, $113 million of aggregate letters of credit were outstanding against the revolving line of credit facility, including a
$103 million letter of credit as a result of the Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas") litigation. For further information regarding the Ventas litigation, see Note 12.

The
Company's revolving line of credit facility contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements, including cross-default provisions to other indebtedness. Among
other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio
of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75 times, and (iv) require a formula-determined Minimum
Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $6.9 billion at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the
revolving line of credit facility.

On
May 8, 2009, the Company repaid the remaining $320 million outstanding balance under its bridge loan credit facility, which accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to
LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.425% to 1.25%, with proceeds received from the issuance of shares of its common stock.

On
March 10, 2010, the Company repaid the total outstanding indebtedness of $200 million under its term loan. The term loan had an original maturity of August 1,
2011. As a result of the early repayment of the term loan, the Company recognized a charge of $1.3 million related to unamortized issuance costs. At the time the term loan was paid off, it
accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 2.00%.

Senior Unsecured Notes

At December 31, 2010, the Company had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of
$3.3 billion. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 1.27% to 7.12%. The weighted average effective interest rate on the senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2010 was 6.19%. Discounts
and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related senior unsecured notes. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt,
cross-acceleration provisions and other customary terms. As of December 31, 2010, the Company believes it was in compliance with these covenants.

In

completed by June 13, 2011 (under certain conditions permitted under the definitive agreement this date may be extended to September 13, 2011), the Company is required to redeem all of
these senior unsecured notes at 101% of the principal amount 20 business days subsequent to the earlier of such date or the date that the definitive agreement is terminated.

Mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally
non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered assets, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires
maintenance of the assets in good condition, requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the
mortgage debt is also cross-collateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets.

Other Debt

At December 31, 2010, the Company had $92.2 million of non-interest bearing life care bonds at two of its
CCRCs and non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of its senior housing facility, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively, "Life Care
Bonds"). At December 31, 2010, $35.9 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the

(12) Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of the
Company's business. Except as described in this Note 12, the Company is not aware of any other legal proceedings or claims that it believes may have, individually or taken together, a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. The Company's policy is to accrue legal expenses as they are incurred.

On
May 3, 2007, Ventas filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky asserting claims of tortious interference
with contract and tortious interference with prospective business advantage. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the Company interfered with Ventas' purchase agreement with Sunrise Senior
Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT"); that the Company interfered with Ventas' prospective business advantage in connection with the Sunrise REIT transaction; and that the Company's
actions caused
Ventas to suffer damages. As part of the same litigation, the Company filed counterclaims against Ventas as successor to Sunrise REIT. On March 25, 2009, the District Court issued an order
dismissing the Company's counterclaims. On April 8, 2009, the Company filed a motion for leave to file amended counterclaims. On May 26, 2009, the District Court denied the Company's
motion.

Ventas
sought approximately $300 million in compensatory damages plus punitive damages. On July 16, 2009, the District Court dismissed Ventas' claim that HCP interfered
with Ventas' purchase agreement with Sunrise REIT, dismissed claims for compensatory damages based on alleged financing and other costs, and allowed Ventas' claim of interference with prospective
advantage to proceed to

F-30


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

trial.
Ventas' claim was tried before a jury between August 18, 2009 and September 4, 2009. During the trial, the District Court dismissed Ventas' claim for punitive damages. On
September 4, 2009, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Ventas in the amount of approximately $102 million in compensatory damages. The District Court entered a judgment against the
Company in that amount on September 8, 2009, which the Company recognized as a provision for litigation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2009.

On
September 22, 2009, the Company filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial. Also on September 22, 2009, Ventas filed a motion seeking
approximately $20 million in prejudgment interest and approximately $4 million in additional damages to account for changes in currency exchange rates. The District Court denied both
parties' post-trial motions on November 17, 2009. The Company filed a notice of appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on November 17, 2009;
Ventas filed a notice of appeal on November 25, 2009. The Company is seeking to have the judgment against it reversed. In the cross-appeal, Ventas is seeking reversal of the district court's
exclusion of Ventas' claim for punitive damages, additional damages due to currency and stock-price fluctuations, and pre-judgment interest. The appeal and cross-appeal have now been fully
briefed, and oral argument before the Court of Appeals is scheduled for March 10, 2011.

On
June 29, 2009, several of the Company's subsidiaries, together with three of its tenants, filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Sunrise Senior
Living, Inc. and three of its subsidiaries ("Sunrise"). A complaint was also filed on behalf of several others of the Company's subsidiaries and one tenant on July 24, 2009 in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

On
August 31, 2010, the Company entered into agreements with Sunrise that allowed the Company to terminate management contracts on 27 of the 75 senior housing communities owned by
the Company and managed by Sunrise. In exchange, the Company agreed to pay Sunrise a total of $50 million, which after a partial offset for certain working capital acquired in conjunction with
this transaction reduced the Company's net investment to acquire these termination rights to $41 million. The Company capitalized the $41 million as a deferred leasing cost, included in
other assets, which will be amortized over the initial term of the new leases with Emeritus Corporation ("Emeritus"). As part of this
arrangement, the Company and Sunrise agreed to dismiss all litigation proceedings between them. Additionally, Sunrise agreed to limit certain fees and charges associated with the remaining
in-place management contracts. On October 18, 2010, Emeritus entered into agreements with the Company to lease the 27 properties under two 15-year triple-net
master leases that each includes two ten-year extension options. On November 1, 2010, the lease term commenced and the operations were transitioned to Emeritus.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of operators, tenants or obligors related to the Company's investments are engaged
in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the
Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. The Company regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio to assess potential concentrations of risks. Management believes
the current portfolio is reasonably diversified across healthcare related real estate and does not contain any other significant concentration of credit risks, except as disclosed herein. The Company
does not have significant foreign operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had investments in mezzanine and secured loans to HCR ManorCare with an aggregate par value of $1.72 billion at each period end
and a carrying value of $1.59 billion and $1.54 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of these investments represented approximately 75% and
85%, respectively, of the Company's post-acute/skilled nursing segment assets and 12% and 13%, respectively, of total assets. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
the Company recognized $113 million, $81 million and $84 million, respectively, in interest income from these investments, which represents approximately 71%, 68% and 70%,
respectively, of the Company's post-acute/skilled nursing segment revenues and 9%, 7% and 7%, respectively, of total revenues. See Note 5 for discussions on the HCR ManorCare
Acquisition.

At
December 31, 2010, Sunrise operated 48 of the Company's senior housing facilities. Sunrise is a publicly traded company and is subject to the informational filing requirements
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is required to file periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the SEC. Among other things, Sunrise
has disclosed that as of September 30, 2010, it has no borrowing availability under its bank credit facility, has significant scheduled debt maturities in 2011 and significant
long-term debt that is in default. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the aggregate carrying value of the Company's gross assets leased to Sunrise represented approximately 30% and 40%,
respectively, of the Company's senior housing
segment assets and 10% and 14%, respectively, of its total assets. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $144 million, $129 million and
$154 million, respectively, in revenues from facilities operated by Sunrise, which represented approximately 37%, 38% and 44%, respectively, of the Company's senior housing segment revenues and
11%, 11% and 13%, respectively, of its total revenues. The year ended December 31, 2010 includes increases of $29.4 million and $25.9 million in revenues and operating expenses,
respectively, as a result of reflecting the facility-level results for 27 facilities leased to four VIE tenants operated by Sunrise that were consolidated, for the period from August 31, 2010
to November 1, 2010, as a result of the termination rights the Company acquired from the settlement agreement discussed above. See Note 21 for additional information regarding VIEs.

On
October 1, 2009, the Company completed the transition of management agreements on 15 communities operated by Sunrise that were previously terminated for Sunrise's failure to
achieve certain performance thresholds. The transition of these facilities to new operators reduced the Company's Sunrise-managed facilities in its portfolio to 75 communities. The termination of the
management agreements did not require the payment of a termination fee to Sunrise by its tenants or the Company. On June 30, 2009, the Company recognized impairments of $6 million
related to intangible assets associated with 12 of the 15 communities.

To
mitigate credit risk of certain senior housing leases, leases are combined into portfolios that contain cross-default terms, so that if a tenant of any of the properties in a
portfolio defaults on its obligations under its lease, the Company may pursue its remedies under the lease with respect to any of the properties in the portfolio. Certain portfolios also contain terms
whereby the net operating profits of the properties are combined for the purpose of securing the funding of rental payments due under each lease.

At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company's gross real estate assets in the state of California, excluding assets held for sale, represented approximately 26% and 33% of the
Company's total assets, respectively.

DownREIT LLCs

In connection with the formation of certain DownREIT limited liability companies ("LLCs"), members may contribute appreciated real
estate to a DownREIT LLC in exchange for DownREIT units. These contributions are generally tax-deferred, so that
the pre-contribution gain related to the property is not taxed to the member. However, if a contributed property is later sold by the DownREIT LLC, the unamortized
pre-contribution gain that exists at the date of sale is specifically allocated and taxed to the contributing members. In many of the DownREITs, the Company has entered into
indemnification agreements with those members who contributed appreciated property into the DownREIT LLC. Under these indemnification agreements, if any of the appreciated real estate
contributed by the members is sold by the DownREIT LLC in a taxable transaction within a specified number of years, the Company will reimburse the affected members for the federal and state
income taxes associated with the pre-contribution gain that is specially allocated to the affected member under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("make-whole
payments"). These make-whole payments include a tax gross-up provision.

Credit Enhancement Guarantee

Certain of the Company's senior housing facilities serve as collateral for $128 million of debt (maturing May 1, 2025)
that is owed by a previous owner of the facilities. This indebtedness is guaranteed by the previous owner who has an investment grade credit rating. These senior housing facilities, which are
classified as DFLs, had a carrying value of $364 million as of December 31, 2010.

Environmental Costs

The Company monitors its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
liability with respect to the properties that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company carries environmental insurance
and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limitations and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and current
industry practice.

General Uninsured Losses

The Company obtains various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property, business interruption, liability, flood, windstorm,
earthquake, environmental and terrorism related losses. The Company attempts to obtain appropriate policy terms, conditions, limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss, the cost of
such coverage and current industry practice. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war or other
events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. In addition, the Company has a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake, flood and windstorm occurrences for which
the related insurances carry high deductibles. Should a significant uninsured loss occur at a property, the Company's assets may become impaired.

Tenant Purchase Options

Certain leases contain purchase options whereby the tenant may elect to acquire the underlying real estate. Annualized lease payments

Noncontrolling Interests

On March 30, 2009, the Company purchased the noncontrolling interests in three senior housing joint ventures for
$9 million that had an aggregate carrying value of $4 million. The payment in excess of the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests was charged to additional paid-in
capital.

At
December 31, 2010, there were 4.2 million non-managing member units outstanding in five limited liability companies, all of which the Company is the managing
member. At December 31, 2010, the carrying and market value of the 4.2 million DownREIT units were $173.7 million and $219.8 million, respectively.

(14) Segment Disclosures

The Company evaluates its business and makes resource allocations based on its five business segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science,
(iii) medical office, (iv) post-acute/skilled nursing and (v) hospital. Under the senior housing, life science, hospital and post-acute/skilled
nursing segments, the Company invests primarily in single operator or tenant properties, through the acquisition and development of real estate or through investment in debt issued by operators in
these sectors. Under the medical office segment, the Company invests through the acquisition of MOBs that are primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases, which are generally to multiple
tenants and require a greater level of property management. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see
Note 2). There were no intersegment sales or transfers during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company evaluates performance based upon property net operating income from
continuing operations ("NOI"), and interest income of the combined investments in each segment.

Non-segment
assets consist primarily of real estate held for sale and corporate assets including cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, net and deferred financing costs.
Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments in determining the Company's performance measure.
See Note 12 for other information regarding concentrations of credit risk.

NOI
is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. The Company defines NOI as rental
revenues, including tenant recoveries and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes interest income, investment management fee income, depreciation and
amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, litigation provision, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, income taxes, equity income from unconsolidated joint
ventures and discontinued operations. The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the
property level on an unleveraged basis. The Company uses NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and assess property level performance. The Company believes that net income is the most
directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP because it does not reflect the aforementioned
excluded items. Further, the Company's definition of NOI may not be comparable to the definition used by other REITs, as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.

On October 5, 2006, simultaneous with the closing of the Company's merger with CRP, the Company also merged with CNL Retirement Corp.
("CRC"). CRP was a REIT that invested primarily in senior housing facilities and MOBs. Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of CRC were recorded at their relative fair
values, with $51.7 million paid in excess of the fair value of CRC's assets and liabilities recorded as goodwill. The CRC goodwill amount was allocated in proportion to the assets of the
Company's reporting units (property sectors) subsequent to the CRP acquisition.

Due
to a significant decrease in the Company's market capitalization during the first quarter of 2009, it performed an interim assessment of the Company's allocated goodwill balances. In
connection

with
this review, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1.4 million, included in other income, net, for the goodwill allocated to the life science segment. At December 31,
2010, goodwill of $50.4 million is allocated as follows: (i) senior housing—$30.5 million, (ii) medical office—$11.4 million,
(iii) post-acute/skilled nursing—$3.3 million and (iv) hospital—$5.1 million. The Company completed the required annual impairment test
during the three months ended December 31, 2010; no impairment was recognized based on the results of this impairment test.

(16) Compensation Plans

Stock Based Compensation

On May 11, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the 2006 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2006 Incentive Plan"). The 2006
Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock and performance restricted stock units to officers, employees and directors in
connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. On April 23, 2009, the Company's stockholders amended the 2006 Incentive Plan. As a result of the amendment, the
maximum number of shares reserved for awards under the 2006 Incentive Plan, as amended, is 23.2 million shares. The maximum number of shares available for future awards under the 2006 Incentive
Plan is 9.3 million shares at December 31, 2010, of
which approximately 6.2 million shares may be issued as restricted stock and performance restricted stock units.

Stock Options

Stock options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date.
Stock options generally vest ratably over a five-year period and have a 10-year contractual term. Vesting of certain options may accelerate, as defined in the grant, upon
retirement, a change in control, or other specified events.

Proceeds

total
intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $2.3 million, $4.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively.

The
fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model
that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date. The expected life (estimated period of time
outstanding) of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees and turnover rates. For stock options granted in 2010, the expected volatility was based the
average of the Company's: (i) historical volatility of the adjusted closing prices of its common stock for a period equal to the stock option's expected life, ending on the grant date, and
calculated on a weekly basis and (ii) the implied volatility of traded options on its common stock for a period equal to 30 days ending on the grant date. For stock options granted prior
to 2010, the expected volatility was based the Company's historical volatility of the adjusted closing prices of its common stock for a period equal to the stock option's expected life, ending on the
grant date, and calculated on a weekly basis. The following table summarizes the Company's stock option valuation assumptions:

Restricted Stock and Performance Restricted Stock Units

Under the 2006 Incentive Plan, restricted stock and performance restricted stock units generally have a contractual life or vest over a
three- to five-year period. The vesting of certain restricted shares and units may accelerate, as defined in the grant, upon retirement, a change in control and other events. When vested,
each performance restricted stock unit is convertible into one share of common stock. The restricted stock and performance restricted stock units are valued on the grant date based on the market price
of the Company's common stock on that date. Generally, the Company recognizes the fair value of the awards over the applicable vesting period as compensation expense. Upon any exercise or payment of
restricted shares or units, the participant is required to pay the related tax withholding obligation. The 2006 Incentive Plan enables the participant to elect to have the Company reduce the number of
shares to be delivered to pay the related tax
withholding obligation. The value of the shares withheld is dependent on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
Company withheld 154,000, 110,000 and 99,000 shares, respectively, to offset tax withholding obligations.

At December 31, 2010, the weighted average remaining vesting period of restricted stock units and restricted stock was three years. The
total fair values of restricted stock and restricted stock units which vested for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $12.5 million, $7.6 million and
$9.5 million, respectively.

On
August 14, 2006, the Company granted 219,000 restricted stock units to the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The restricted stock units vest over a period of ten
years beginning in 2012. Additionally, as the Company pays dividends on its outstanding common stock, the original award will be credited with additional restricted stock units as dividend equivalents
(in lieu of receiving a cash payment). Generally, the dividend equivalent restricted stock units will be subject to the same vesting and other conditions as applied to the grant. At
December 31, 2010, the total number of restricted stock units under this arrangement was approximately 287,000.

Total
share-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $15.1 million, $14.6 million and $13.8 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2010, there was $36.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the
Company's incentive plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years.

Employee Benefit Plan

The Company maintains a 401(k) and profit sharing plan that allows for eligible participants to defer compensation, subject to certain
limitations imposed by the Code. The Company provides a matching contribution of up to 4% of each participant's eligible compensation. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company's matching contributions
were approximately $0.9 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

(17) Impairments

On October 12, 2010, the Company concluded that its 35% interest in HCP Ventures II, which owns 25 senior housing properties leased by Horizon Bay
Communities or certain of its affiliates (collectively "Horizon Bay"), was impaired. The impairment resulted from the recent and projected deterioration of the operating performance of the properties
leased by Horizon Bay from HCP Ventures II. During the year ended December 31, 2010 the Company recognized an impairment of $71.7 million related to its investment in HCP Ventures II,
which reduced the carrying value of its investment from $136.8 million to its fair value of $65.1 million. The fair value of the Company's investment in HCP Ventures II was based on a
discounted cash flow valuation model that is considered

F-43


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

to
be a Level III measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Inputs to this valuation model include real estate capitalization rates, discount rates, industry growth rates and operating
margins, some of which influence the Company's expectation of future cash flows from HCP Ventures II and, accordingly, the fair value of its investment.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized impairments of $75.5 million (including $0.1 million in discontinued operations) as follows:
(i) $63.1 million in the senior housing segment related to three DFLs and a participation in a senior construction loan associated with properties operated by Erickson resulting from the
conclusion of their bankruptcy auction and amended reorganization plan, (ii) $5.9 million related to intangible assets on 12 of 15 senior housing communities that were determined to be
impaired due to the termination of the Sunrise management agreements effective October 1, 2009 in the senior housing segment, (iii) $4.3 million related to a senior secured term
loan to an affiliate of Cirrus as a result of discussions to restructure its loan in the hospital segment and (iv) $2.2 million related to intangible assets associated with the early
termination of a lease in the life science segment.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized impairments of $27.5 million as follows: (i) $12.0 million related to intangible assets
associated with the transfer of an 11-property senior housing portfolio, (ii) $3.7 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of three leases
in the life science segment, (iii) $1.0 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of two leases in the hospital segment, (iv) $1.6 million
related to two senior housing facilities as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows, and (v) $9.2 million, included in discontinued operations, related to the decrease in expected
cash flows and anticipated disposition of two senior housing properties and one hospital.

(18) Income Taxes

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company's total income tax expense was $0.4 million, $2.1 million, and
$3.8 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company's income tax expense from continuing operations was $0.4 million,
$1.9 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The Company's deferred income tax expense and its ending
balance in deferred tax assets and liabilities were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the tax basis of the Company's net assets is less than the reported amounts by $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. The
difference between the reported amounts and the tax basis is primarily related to the Company's acquisition of Slough Estates USA, Inc. ("SEUSA").

The
Company files numerous U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax returns. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local tax
examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 2007.

SEUSA Acquisition

On August 1, 2007, HCP Life Science REIT, a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired the stock of SEUSA, causing SEUSA to become a
qualified REIT subsidiary. As a result of the acquisition, HCP Life Science REIT succeeded to SEUSA's tax attributes, including SEUSA's tax basis in its net assets. Prior to the acquisition, SEUSA was
a corporation subject to federal and state income taxes. HCP Life Science REIT will be subject to a corporate-level tax on any taxable disposition of SEUSA's pre-acquisition assets that
occur within ten years after the August 1, 2007 acquisition. The

F-44


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

corporate-level
tax would be assessed only to the extent of the built-in gain that existed on the date of acquisition, based on the fair market value of the assets on August 1,
2007. The Company does not expect to dispose of any assets included in the SEUSA acquisition, if such a disposition would result in the imposition of a material tax liability. As a result, the Company
has not recorded a deferred tax liability associated with this corporate-level tax. Gains from asset dispositions occurring more than 10 years after the acquisition will not be subject to this
corporate-level tax. However, the Company may dispose of SEUSA assets before the 10-year period if it is able to effect a tax deferred exchange. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
tax basis of the Company's net assets included in the SEUSA acquisition is less than the reported amounts by $1.69 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively.

In
connection with the SEUSA acquisition, the Company assumed SEUSA's unrecognized tax benefits of $8 million. During 2008, the Company recognized other increases to unrecognized
tax benefits of $0.9 million. After receiving approval from the taxing authorities in 2009 to change this tax position, the Company decreased unrecognized tax benefits by $0.9 million.
During 2010, the Company decreased unrecognized tax benefits by $1.1 million to reflect the settlement of federal tax audits for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006.

The Company anticipates that the balance in unrecognized tax benefits will be eliminated in 2011 as a result of both the settlement of state tax
audits and the lapse of the applicable statue of limitations period. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded interest expense associated with the
unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

The
Company has an agreement with the seller of SEUSA where any increases in taxes and associated interest and penalties related to years prior to the SEUSA acquisition will be the
responsibility of the seller. Similarly, any pre-acquisition tax refunds and associated interest income will be refunded to the seller.

There
would be no effect on the Company's tax rate if the unrecognized tax benefits were to be recognized

Restricted stock and certain of the Company's performance restricted stock units are considered participating securities which require the use of
the two-class method when computing basic and diluted earnings per share. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, earnings representing nonforfeitable dividends of
$2.1 million, $1.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were allocated to the participating securities.

(21) Variable Interest Entities

At December 31, 2010, the Company leased 48 properties to a total of seven tenants ("VIE tenants") where each tenant has been identified as a VIE. In
addition, the Company has investments in certain loans where each borrower has been identified as a VIE.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

During 2010, the Company had leasing relationships with a total of four VIE tenants, related to 27 properties, whose operations were
not consolidated by the Company prior to August 31, 2010 as the Company determined that it did not have the ability to control their activities (i.e., recurring operating activities)
that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. On August 31, 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Sunrise, whereby it determined that it had acquired the
ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. The Company consolidated these four VIEs for the period from August 31, 2010 (the date of the
settlement agreement with Sunrise) to November 1, 2010 (the date these 27 properties were transitioned and leased to Emeritus).

Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

At December 31, 2010, the Company leased 48 properties to a total of seven VIE tenants and had additional investments in loans
to VIE borrowers. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. The carrying value and classification of the related assets, liabilities and maximum exposure to loss
as a result of the Company's involvement with these VIEs are presented below at December 31, 2010 (in thousands):

The
Company's maximum loss exposure related to the VIE tenants represents the future minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the respective leases
that may be mitigated by re-leasing the properties to new tenants. The Company's maximum loss exposure related to loans with VIEs represents their current aggregate carrying value
including accrued interest.

As of December 31, 2010 the Company has not provided, and is not required to provide, financial support through a liquidity arrangement or
otherwise, to its unconsolidated VIEs, including circumstances in which it could be exposed to further losses (e.g., cash short falls).

The
Company holds an interest-only, senior secured term loan made to a borrower that has been identified as a VIE. The Company does not consolidate the VIE because it does
not have the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance. The loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the borrower (comprised primarily of
interests in partnerships that operate surgical facilities, some of which are on the premises of properties owned by the Company or HCP Ventures IV) and is supported in part by limited
guarantees made by certain principals of Cirrus. Recourse under certain of these guarantees is limited to the guarantors' respective ownership interests in certain entities owning real estate that are
pledged to secure such guarantees.

On
December 21, 2007, the Company made an investment of approximately $900 million in mezzanine loans where each borrower was identified as a VIE. The Company has
determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. The Company has no formal involvement in the VIEs beyond its investment. The Company does not consolidate the VIEs because it does not
have the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance. At December 31, 2010, these interest-only loans are secured by an indirect
pledge of equity ownership in 334 HCR ManorCare facilities located in 30 states and were subordinate to other debt of approximately $3.6 billion. See Note 5 for discussions on the HCR
ManorCare Acquisition.

See
Notes 6, 7 and 12 for additional description of the nature, purpose and activities of the Company's VIEs and interests therein.

(23) Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, payables, and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair value because
of the short-term maturities of these instruments. Fair values for loans receivable, bank line of credit, bridge loan, credit facilities, mortgage and other secured debt, and other debt
are estimates based on rates currently prevailing for similar instruments with similar maturities. The fair values of the interest-rate swaps and warrants were determined based on
observable and unobservable market assumptions using standardized derivative pricing models. The fair values of the senior unsecured notes and marketable equity and debt securities were determined
based on market quotes.

Acquired
in conjunction with mortgage debt assumed related to real estate acquired on December 28, 2010. Hedges fluctuations in interest payments on
variable-rate secured debt due to overall changes in the hedged cash flows.

The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on specific forecasted transactions as well as
recognized financial obligations or assets. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

The
primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market and credit risk. Market risk is defined as the potential for loss in value of a derivative instrument due to adverse
changes in market prices (interest rates). Utilizing derivative instruments allows the Company to effectively manage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates related to the potential effects these
changes could have on future earnings, forecasted cash flows and the fair value of recognized obligations.

Credit
risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation. The Company does not obtain collateral associated with its
derivative instruments, but monitors the credit standing of its counterparties on a regular basis. Should a counterparty fail to perform, the Company would incur a financial loss to the extent that
the associated derivative contract was in an asset position. At December 31, 2010, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties to its outstanding
derivative contracts.

During
October and November 2007, the Company entered into two forward-starting interest-rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $900 million and
settled the contracts during the three months ended June 30, 2008. The settlement value, less the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships, was recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income to be reclassified into interest expense over the forecasted term of the underlying unsecured fixed-rate debt. The interest-rate swap contracts were
designated in qualifying, cash flow hedging relationships, to hedge the Company's

F-50


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

exposure
to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate component of interest payments on forecasted, unsecured, fixed-rate debt currently expected to be issued in 2011 and 2012. During
2010, the Company revised its estimated issuance date for the underlying unsecured, fixed-rate debt. As a result, the Company recognized a $1.0 million charge in other income, net,
during the year ended December 31, 2010, related to the interest payments that are no longer probable of occurring.

In
August 2009, the Company entered into an interest-rate swap contract (pay float and receive fixed), that is designated as hedging fluctuations in interest receipts related
to its participation in the variable-rate first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare. Concurrent with executing the definitive agreement for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, the Company determined
the likelihood of the related hedged transactions (underlying mortgage debt interest receipts) of occurring was reduced from probable to reasonably possible. As a result, the Company discontinued
hedge accounting and will recognize subsequent fair value changes in the interest rate swap contact in earnings prospectively. At December 31, 2010, $1.4 million of unrealized gains
related to this interest-rate swap contract remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss; this amount will be amortized into earnings in 2011, as the hedged transactions (the underlying
mortgage debt interest receipts) occur.

For
the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized additional interest income of $4.0 million and a reduction of interest expense of $1.5 million,
resulting from its cash flow and fair value hedging relationships. At December 31, 2010, the Company expects that the hedged forecasted transactions, for each of the outstanding qualifying cash
flow hedging relationships, except as previously discussed, remain probable of occurring and that no additional gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be
reclassified to earnings.

To
illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets, the Company performed a market sensitivity analysis on its outstanding hedging instruments. The Company applied
various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments' change in fair value. The following table summarizes the results
of the analysis performed (dollars in thousands):

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Mr. Elcan
and Mr. Klaritch, an executive vice president of the Company, were previously senior executives and limited liability company members of MedCap
Properties, LLC, which was acquired in October 2003 by HCP and a joint venture of which HCP was the managing member. As part of that transaction, MedCap Properties, LLC contributed
certain property interests to a newly-formed entity, HCPI/Tennessee LLC, in exchange for DownREIT units. In connection with the transactions, Messrs. Elcan and Klaritch received 610,397
and 113,431 non-managing member units, respectively, in HCPI/Tennessee, LLC in a distribution of their respective interests in MedCap Properties, LLC. Each DownREIT unit is
redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of two shares of HCP's common stock or, at HCP's option, two shares of HCP's common stock (subject to certain
adjustments, such as stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications). In addition, the HCPI/Tennessee, LLC agreement provides for a "make-whole" payment, intended to cover
grossed-up tax liabilities, to
the non-managing members upon the sale of certain properties acquired by HCPI/Tennessee, LLC in the MedCap transactions and other events.
