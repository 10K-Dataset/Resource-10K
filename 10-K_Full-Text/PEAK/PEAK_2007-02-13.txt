Business
Overview

Health Care Property
Investors, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint
ventures (collectively, “HCP” or the “Company”), invests primarily in real
estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. Health Care
Property Investors, Inc. is a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
organized in 1985. The Company is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with
operations in Nashville, Tennessee and Orlando, Florida, and its portfolio
includes interests in 731 properties. The Company acquires healthcare
facilities and leases them to healthcare providers and provides mortgage
financing secured by healthcare facilities. The Company’s portfolio includes: (i) senior
housing, including independent living facilities (“ILFs”), assisted living
facilities (“ALFs”), and continuing care retirement communities (“CCRCs”); (ii) medical
office buildings (“MOBs”); (iii) hospitals; (iv) skilled nursing
facilities (“SNFs”); and (v) other healthcare facilities, including
laboratory and office buildings. For business segment financial data, see our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

References herein to “HCP,”
the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” include Health Care Property Investors, Inc.
and its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, unless the context
otherwise requires.

On our internet website, www.hcpi.com, you can access,
free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and
amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after such
material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In addition, the SEC maintains an internet website
that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information
regarding issuers, including HCP, that file electronically with the SEC at
www.sec.gov.

Healthcare
Industry

Healthcare is the single largest industry in the
United States, representing 16% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) in 2004
and growing at a rate faster than the overall economy.

Expenditures Rising as a Percentage of GDP

Medicare and Medicaid, December 2006.

Compound
Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”)


The delivery of
healthcare services requires real estate and as a consequence, healthcare
providers depend on real estate to maintain and grow their businesses. HCP
believes that the current healthcare real estate market provides an investment
opportunity due to the:

·

Likelihood of consolidation
of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector;

·

Specialized nature of
healthcare real estate investing; and

·

Compelling demographics
driving the demand for healthcare services.

Senior citizens are the
largest consumers of healthcare services. According to the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid, on a per capita basis, the 75 years and older segment of the
population spends 75% more on healthcare than the 65 to 74-year-old
segment and nearly 300% more than the population average.

Business Strategy

We are organized to invest
in healthcare-related facilities. Our primary goal is to increase shareholder
value through profitable growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal
is based on three principles—opportunistic investing, portfolio
diversification, and conservative financing.

Opportunistic
Investing

We make real estate
investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create long-term
shareholder value. We attempt to position ourselves to create and take
advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria. We invest in
properties directly and through joint ventures, and provide secured financing,
depending on the nature of the investment opportunity.

Portfolio
Diversification

We believe in maintaining
a portfolio of healthcare-related real estate diversified by sector, geography,
operator and investment product. Diversification within the healthcare industry
reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business.
This allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on
individual market dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of


maintaining
diversification in our portfolio, there are no specific limitations under our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws on the percentage of our total assets
that may be invested in any one property, property type, geographic location or
in the number of properties which we may invest in, lease or lend to a single
operator. With investments in multiple sectors of healthcare real estate, HCP
can focus on opportunities with the best risk/reward profile for the portfolio
as a whole, rather than having to choose from transactions within a specific
property type.

Conservative Financing

We believe a conservative
balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute our opportunistic
investing approach and portfolio diversification principles. We maintain our
conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and
maintaining available sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of
credit. Our debt is primarily fixed rate, which reduces the impact of rising
interest rates on our operations. Generally, we attempt to match the long-term
duration of our leases with long-term fixed-rate financing.

In underwriting our
investments, we structure and adjust the price of the investment in accordance with
our assessment of risk. We may structure transactions as master leases, require
indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or
security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk. We finance our
investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For
short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for
other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for
longer-term financing through public offerings or from institutional investors.
We may incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock. We may
incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we acquire. We may also
obtain non-recourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in
which we have invested or may refinance existing debt on properties acquired.

Competition

Our properties compete
with the facilities of other landlords and healthcare providers. The landlords
and operators of these competing properties may have capital resources
substantially in excess of ours or of the operators of our facilities. The
occupancy and rental income at our properties depend upon several factors,
including the number of physicians using the healthcare facilities or referring
patients to the facilities, competing properties and healthcare providers, and
the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area. Private,
federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may
also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and
their tenants. Virtually all of our properties operate in a competitive
environment in which tenants, patients and referral sources, including
physicians, may change their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to
time.

Investing in real estate
is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment
companies, healthcare operators and other institutional investors when we
attempt to acquire properties. Increased competition reduces the number of
opportunities that meet our investment criteria. If we do not identify
investments that meet our investment criteria, our ability to increase
shareholder value through profitable growth may be limited.


Transaction Overview

Mergers with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. and
CNL Retirement Corp.

On October 5, 2006,
we closed our merger with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CRP”) for
aggregate consideration of approximately $5.3 billion. In the CRP merger, we
paid an aggregate of $2.9 billion of cash, issued 22.8 million shares of our
common stock, and we either assumed or refinanced approximately $1.7 billion of
CRP’s outstanding debt. We initially financed the cash consideration paid to
CRP stockholders and the expenses related to the transaction through an
offering of senior notes, a draw down under new term and bridge loan facilities
and a new three-year revolving credit facility. Our results of operations for
2006 include the results of the combined company beginning on October 5,
2006. For more information about the CRP merger, see Note 5 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Simultaneous with the
closing of the merger with CRP, we also merged with CNL Retirement Corp. (“CRC”)
for aggregate consideration of approximately $120 million, which included the
issuance of 4.4 million shares of our common stock.

Investment Transactions

During
2006, including the CRP merger discussed above, we acquired interests in
properties aggregating $5.9 billion with an average yield of 6.9%. Our 2006
investments were made in the following healthcare sectors: (i) 77% senior
housing facilities; (ii) 19% MOBs; (iii) 3% hospitals; and (iv) 1%
other healthcare facilities. Our 2006 real estate investments included the
following:

·

During the three months
ended March 31, 2006, we acquired 13 medical office buildings for $138
million, including non-managing member LLC units (“DownREIT units”) valued at
$6 million, in related transactions. The 13 buildings, with 730,000 rentable
square feet, have an initial yield of 7.3%.

·

On May 31, 2006, we
acquired nine assisted living and independent living facilities for $99
million, including assumed debt valued at $61 million, through a sale-leaseback
transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of ten years, with two
ten-year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is approximately 8.0%
with annual CPI-based escalators.

·

On November 30, 2006,
we acquired four assisted living and independent living facilities for $51
million, through a sale-leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial
lease term of ten years, with two ten-year renewal options. The initial annual
lease rate is approximately 8.0% with annual escalators based on the Consumer
Price Index (“CPI”).

During 2006, we sold 83
properties for $512 million and recognized gains of approximately $275 million.
These sales included 69 SNFs sold on December 1, 2006, for $392 million
with gains of approximately $226 million. On or before December 1, 2006,
tenants for nine SNFs exercised rights of first refusal to acquire such
facilities. The sales of the nine SNFs for $52 million are expected to be
completed by June 30, 2007.

On November 17, 2006,
we purchased $300 million senior secured notes issued by a HCA Inc. These notes
accrue interest at 9.625%, mature on November 15, 2016, and are secured by
second-priority liens on the HCA’s and its subsidiary guarantors’ assets.

On January 31, 2007,
we acquired three long-term acute care hospitals and received proceeds of $36
million in exchange for 11 skilled nursing facilities valued at approximately
$77 million. The three acquired properties have an initial lease term of ten
years, with two ten-year renewal options, and an initial


contractual
yield of 12% with escalators based on the lessee’s revenue growth. The acquired
properties are included in a new master lease that contains 14 properties
leased to the same operator.

On February 9, 2007,
we acquired the Medical City Dallas campus, which includes two hospital towers,
six medical office buildings, and three parking garages, for approximately $347
million, including non-managing member LLC units (“DownREIT units’’) valued at
$174 million. The initial yield on this campus is approximately 7.3%.

Joint Venture Transactions

On October 27, 2006,
we formed an MOB joint venture with an institutional capital partner. The joint
venture includes 13 properties valued at $140 million and encumbered by $92
million of mortgage debt. Upon formation, we received approximately $36 million
in proceeds, including a one-time acquisition fee of $0.7 million. We retained
an effective 26% interest in the venture, will act as the managing member, and
will receive ongoing asset management fees.

On November 30, 2006,
we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of General Electric Company in
HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (“HCP MOP”), for $141 million. We are now the
sole owner of the venture and its 59 MOBs, which have approximately four
million rentable square feet. At closing, $251 million of mortgage debt
encumbered these MOBs.

On January 5, 2007,
we formed a senior housing joint venture with an institutional capital partner.
The joint venture includes 25 properties valued at $1.1 billion and encumbered
by a $686 million secured debt facility. Upon formation, we received
approximately $280 million in proceeds, including a one-time acquisition fee of
$5.4 million. Including the $446 million recently received from the secured
debt facility with Fannie Mae discussed below, we received $726 million in
total proceeds. We retained a 35% interest in the venture, will act as the
managing member, and will receive ongoing asset management fees.

Capital Market Transactions

During 2006, in addition
to the mortgage debt issued under the Fannie Mae facility discussed below, we
obtained $165 million of ten-year mortgage financing with a weighted average
effective yield of 6.36% in five separate transactions. We received net
proceeds of $162 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and
for other general corporate purposes.

On February 27, 2006,
we issued $150 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes
were priced at 99.071% of the principal amount for an effective yield of
5.788%. We received net proceeds of $149 million, which were used to repay
outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

On September 19,
2006, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes, which consisted of $300
million of floating rate notes due in 2008, $300 million of 5.95% notes due in
2011, and $400 million of 6.30% notes due in 2016. We received net proceeds of
$994 million, which together with cash on hand and borrowings under the new
credit facilities were used to repay our then existing credit facility and to
finance the CRP merger.

On October 5, 2006,
in connection with the CRP merger, we entered into credit agreements with a
syndicate of banks providing for aggregate borrowings of $3.4 billion. The
credit facilities included a $0.7 billion bridge loan, a $1.7 billion two-year
term loan, and a $1.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility. As of December 31,
2006, we had repaid the bridge loan and borrowings under the term loan were
reduced to $0.5 billion. In addition, through our capital market transactions
in January 2007, we fully repaid the balance outstanding under the term
loan.


On November 10, 2006,
we issued 33.5 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of
approximately $960 million, which were used to repay our bridge loan facility
and borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities.

On December 4, 2006,
we issued $400 million of 5.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes
were priced at 99.768% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.69%.
We received net proceeds of $396 million, which were used to repay borrowings
under our term loan facility.

On December 21, 2006,
in anticipation of our senior housing joint venture that closed on
January 5, 2007, we expanded an existing secured debt facility with Fannie
Mae to $686 million, receiving $446 million in proceeds. The Fannie Mae facility
bears interest at a weighted average rate of 5.66%. The funds from the expanded
debt facility were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility.

On January 19, 2007,
we issued 6.8 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of
approximately $261 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term
loan facility.

On January 22, 2007,
we issued $500 million of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes
were priced at 99.323% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.09%.
We received net proceeds of $493 million, which were used to repay borrowings
under our term loan and revolving credit facilities.

Other Events

During the year ended
December 31, 2006, we issued approximately 797,000 shares of our common
stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average
price per share of $28.68 for proceeds of $22.9 million.

Quarterly dividends paid
during 2006 aggregated $1.70 per share. On January 29, 2007, we announced
that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of
$0.445 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 21,
2007, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 5,
2007. The annualized rate of distribution for 2007 is $1.78, compared with
$1.70 for 2006, which represents a 4.7% increase. Our Board of Directors has
determined to continue its policy of considering dividend increases on an
annual rather than quarterly basis.

Senior
housing facilities are stated in units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom
units). Medical office buildings and other healthcare facilities are measured
in square feet. Hospitals and skilled nursing facilities are measured by
licensed bed count.


(2)

Investment for owned
properties represents the carrying amount of real estate assets, including
intangibles, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization, and
excludes assets held for sale and classified as discontinued operations.
Investment for direct financing leases represents the carrying amount of direct
financing leases, after deducting interest accretion. Investment for mortgage
loans receivable and unconsolidated joint ventures represents the carrying
amount of our investment.

(3)

On January 5, 2007,
we formed a joint venture for 25 senior housing assets and retained a 35%
interest in the venture. The carrying value of the 25 senior housing facilities
is classified as real estate held for contribution on our consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2006. On October 13, 2006, we formed a joint
venture with 13 MOBs and retained an effective 26% interest in the venture. The
disposition of a portion of our interest in the 25 senior housing assets and 13
MOBs met the definition under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144
(“SFAS No. 144”) for the assets to qualify as held for sale, however, the
operations are not classified as discontinued operations resulting from our
continuing interest in the ventures. The operating results of these properties
prior to the formation of the ventures are included in the Company’s continuing
operations. The number of properties, capacity, square footage, and investment
for the 13 MOBs are included under the caption of unconsolidated joint
ventures.

(4)

Net
Operating Income from Continuing Operations (“NOI”) is a non-GAAP supplemental
financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate
properties. We define NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements,
less property level operating expenses, which excludes depreciation and
amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, interest
expense and discontinued operations. We believe NOI provides investors relevant
and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our
real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to make
decisions about resource allocations and assess property level performance. We
believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP (U.S. generally
accepted accounting principals) measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an
alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP
since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, NOI may
not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may
use different methodologies for calculating NOI. The following reconciles NOI

Healthcare Sectors and Property Types

We have investments in
senior housing facilities, medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing
facilities, and other healthcare facilities. Certain tenants of our properties
are reliant on government reimbursements, such as those from Medicare and
Medicaid. See “Governmental Regulation” for the potential impact on the value
of our investments and our results of operations. The following describes the
nature of the operations of our tenants and borrowers.

Senior Housing Facilities.

We have interests in 337 senior housing facilities,
including four properties in unconsolidated joint ventures. Senior housing
properties include ILFs, ALFs and CCRCs, which cater to different segments of
the elderly population based upon their needs. Services provided by our tenants
in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through
private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs
such as Medicaid and Medicare.

·

Independent Living Facilities.

ILFs

are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to
live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as
housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need
assistance with activities of daily living (“ADLs”), including bathing, eating
and dressing. However, residents have the option to contract for these
services.

·

Assisted Living Facilities.

ALFs are licensed care
facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those
who need help with ADLs yet require limited medical care. The programs and
services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs,
beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions,
meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These
facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences
ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher
levels of personal assistance for residents with Alzheimer’s disease or other
forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local
regulations.

·

Continuing Care Retirement Communities.

CCRCs provide
housing and health-related services under long-term contracts. This alternative
is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health
and medical needs change, thus allowing residents to “age in place.” Some CCRCs
require a substantial entry fee or buy-in fee, and most also charge monthly
maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services.
CCRCs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and
independent upon entry.


Medical Office Buildings.

We
have interests in 260 MOBs, including 14 properties owned by unconsolidated
joint ventures. These facilities typically contain physicians’ offices and
examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service
space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation
clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities are similar to
commercial office buildings, they require more plumbing, electrical and
mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in
every room, brighter lights and special equipment such as medical gases.

Hospitals.

We
have interests in 35 hospitals, which include 13 acute care, 11 rehabilitation,
four long-term acute care and seven specialty hospitals. Services provided by our tenants in these
facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance
and HMOs), or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

·

Acute Care Hospitals.

Acute care hospitals offer a
wide range of services such as fully-equipped operating and recovery rooms,
obstetrics, radiology, intensive care, open heart surgery and coronary care,
neurosurgery, neonatal intensive care,
magnetic resonance imaging, nursing units, oncology, clinical laboratories,
respiratory therapy, physical therapy, nuclear medicine, rehabilitation
services and outpatient services.

·

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals.

Long-term acute care
hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that
require longer stays and more intensive care, monitoring, or emergency back-up
than that available in most skilled nursing-based programs.

·

Specialty Hospitals

.   Specialty hospitals are licensed
as acute care hospitals but focus on providing care in specific areas such as
cardiac, orthopedic and women’s conditions or specific procedures such as
surgery and are less likely to provide emergency services.

·

Rehabilitation Hospitals.

Rehabilitation hospitals
provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic
injuries or illnesses, such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, head injuries,
orthopedic problems, work-related disabilities and neurological diseases.

Skilled Nursing
Facilities.

We have interests in 69 SNFs. SNFs

offer restorative, rehabilitative
and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and
sophisticated treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenue
from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services to residents
beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory
and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and
orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other
services. Certain skilled nursing facilities provide some of the foregoing
services on an out-patient basis. Skilled nursing services provided by our
tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for either by private sources,
or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Other Healthcare
Facilities.

We have investments in 30 healthcare
laboratory and biotech research facilities. These facilities are designed to
accommodate research and development in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, drug
discovery and development, and predictive and personalized medicine. Our
investments include physician group practice clinic facilities, health and
wellness centers, and facilities used for other healthcare purposes. The
physician group practice clinics generally provide a broad range of medical
services through organized physician groups representing various medical
specialties. Health and wellness centers provide testing and preventative
health maintenance services.


Investment Products

Owned and Joint Venture Property Investments

The Company holds its
investments as wholly owned or in the form of unconsolidated joint ventures
with third-party investors. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in
731 properties, including 18 properties through joint ventures. Whether
owned wholly or through joint ventures, the owned properties may be
characterized as one of three types: triple-net leased property, operating
property or development property.

Triple-net Leased Properties:

Triple-net leased
properties are primarily single-tenant buildings leased to a healthcare
provider under a triple-net lease. Pursuant to triple-net leases, tenants pay
base rent and all operating expenses incurred at the property, including utilities,
property taxes, insurance, and repairs and maintenance. Certain leases contain
annual base rent escalations based on a predetermined fixed rate, an inflation
index or some other factor. Other leases may require tenants to pay additional
rent based upon the operator’s achievement of specific performance thresholds. The
amount of additional rent may be based on a percentage of the facility’s
revenues in excess of revenues for a specific base period or on the funds
available for lease payment after base rent and operating expenses. As of December 31,
2006, the weighted average remaining term, excluding unexercised renewal
options, on our triple-net leased properties is approximately 11 years.

We typically require credit enhancements to cover
short falls in the event the tenant does not generate enough cash flow to pay
rent. The ability of certain senior housing lessees to satisfy their
obligations under leases acquired from CRP depends primarily on the properties’
operating results. Some of these leases have credit enhancements that have
either expired or will expire either by the passage of time or upon the full
utilization of the credit enhancement. In addition, the terms of certain leases
acquired in the CRP acquisition also provide for the tenant to maintain
reserves to fund expenditures to refurbish buildings, premises and equipment to
maintain the facilities in a manner that allows for the operation of the
facilities for their intended purpose. To the extent the credit enhancements or
reserves are inadequate, the tenant may not be able to make rent payments to us
when due or we may be required to fund such amounts.

The
first year annual base rental rates on properties we acquired during 2006
ranged from 6.8% to 9.0% of the purchase price of the property. Rental rates
vary by lease, taking into consideration many factors, including:

·

creditworthiness
of the tenant;

·

operating
performance of the facility;

·

credit
support arrangements;

·

cost
of capital at the inception of the lease;

·

location,
type and physical condition of the facility;

·

barriers
to entry, such as certificates of need, competitive development and
constraining high land costs; and

·

lease term.


Operating
Properties:

Our operating properties
are typically multi-tenant medical office buildings that are leased to multiple
healthcare providers (hospitals and physician practices) under a gross,
modified gross or net lease structure. Under a gross or modified gross lease,
all or a portion of operating expenses are not reimbursed by tenants. Most of
our owned MOBs are managed by third-party property management companies and
21 are leased on a net basis while 239 are leased to multiple tenants
under gross or modified gross leases pursuant to which we are responsible for
certain operating expenses. Regardless of lease structure, most of our leases
at operating properties include annual base rent escalation clauses that are
either predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index,
and typically have an initial term ranging from one to 15 years, with a
weighted average remaining term of approximately five years as of December 31,
2006.

The following table
reflects the annual reduction in revenue (based on 2007 contractual lease
payments) for owned triple-net leased and operating properties resulting from
lease expirations, absent the impact of renewals, if any (in thousands):

Development Properties:

We generally commit to
development projects only if they are at least 50% pre-leased. We use internal
and external construction management expertise to evaluate local market
conditions, construction costs and other factors to seek appropriate
risk-adjusted returns. During 2006, we completed and placed into service
approximately $36 million of development properties.

Investment Management Platform:

We co-invest in real
estate with institutional investors through partnerships, limited liability
companies, and joint ventures. We target investors with long-term investment
horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate. Typically,
we retain interests in the ventures ranging from 20% to 35% and serve as the
managing member. Our co-investment ventures generally allow us to earn
acquisition fees, asset management fees or priority distributions, and have the
potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on
performance of the venture. On October 27, 2006 and January 5, 2007,
a total of $1.3 billion in medical office and senior housing assets were placed
into joint ventures.

Investments in Secured Loans, Direct Financing Leases
and Debt Securities

We have investments in 10
mortgage loans secured by 11 properties that are owned and operated by 9 healthcare
providers. Our secured loan investments typically consist of senior mortgages
or mezzanine financing on individual properties or a pool of properties. At December 31,
2006, the carrying amount of these mortgage loans totaled $121.5 million. The
interest rates on mortgage loans outstanding at


December 31,
2006 ranged from 7.5% to 13.5% per annum. Our mortgage loans generally include
prepayment penalties or yield maintenance provisions.

At December 31, 2006
we had investments in 32 properties that are accounted for under direct
financing leases with original terms that range from five to 35 years. Certain
leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the
properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial
investment amount plus adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements.

We also have investments
in senior secured second lien notes of HCA Inc., which are classified as debt
securities and are recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2006, the fair
value of these senior secured notes was $322.5 million and they are classified
as available for sale. These notes accrue interest at a rate of 9.625%, mature
in 2016, and are secured by second-priority liens on HCA’s and its subsidiary
guarantors’ assets. The issuer of these notes may elect to pay interest in
cash, by increasing the principal amount of the notes for the entire amount of
the interest payments, or by paying half of the interest in cash and half in
additional notes. The first payment due on May 15, 2007 is payable only in
cash. After November 15, 2011, all interest on these notes will be payable
in cash. If the issuer elects to pay with additional principal amounts or
additional notes, the accrual rate is at 10.375%.

properties managed by Sunrise and six properties managed by Brookdale were
acquired from CRP on October 5, 2006.

All of our properties
associated with the aforementioned operators are primarily under triple-net
leases. These operators, excluding Summerville, are subject to the
informational filing requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Financial and other information relating to these
operators may be obtained from their public reports.

According to public
disclosures by Tenet and Sunrise, these companies are experiencing various
legal, financial, and regulatory difficulties. We cannot predict with certainty
the impact, if any, of the outcome of these uncertainties on their financial
condition. The failure or inability of these operators to pay their obligations
could materially reduce our revenues, net income and cash flows, which could in
turn reduce the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends, cause
our stock price to decline and cause us to incur impairment charges or a loss
on the sale of the properties.

One of our hospitals
located in Tarzana, California is operated by Tenet and is affected by State of
California Senate Bill 1953, which requires certain seismic safety building
standards for acute care hospital facilities. See “Government Regulation—California
Senate Bill 1953” for more information.


Joint Ventures

Consolidated Joint
Ventures

At December 31,
2006, we held ownership interests in 23 consolidated limited liability
companies and partnerships that together own 85 properties and one mortgage,

·

A
77% interest in Health Care Property Partners, which owns two hospitals, seven
skilled nursing facilities and has one mortgage on a skilled nursing facility.

·

A
93% interest in HCPI/Sorrento, LLC, which owns a life science facility.

·

A
90% interest in HCPI VPI Sorrento II, LLC, which owns four laboratory, office
and biotechnology manufacturing buildings.

·

A

Ventures III, LLC owns 13 medical office buildings.

Unconsolidated
Joint Ventures

At December 31,
2006, we held ownership interests in six unconsolidated limited liability
companies and partnerships that together own 18 properties as follows:

·

An
effective 26% interest in HCP Ventures III, LLC which owns 13 medical office
buildings.

·

A
45% to 50% interest in each of four limited liability companies (Seminole
Shores Living Center, LLC—50%, Edgewood Assisted Living Center, LLC—45%,
Arborwood Living Center, LLC—45%, and Greenleaf Living Center, LLC—45%) which
each own an assisted living facility.

·

A 67% interest in Suburban
Properties, LLC which owns one medical office building.

Taxation of HCP

We believe that we have operated in such a manner as
to qualify for taxation as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year
ended December 31, 1985, and we intend to continue to operate in such a
manner. No assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to
continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified.
This summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial
interpretations thereof.

If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will
generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion
of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment
substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., at the corporate and
stockholder levels) that generally


results from investment in
a corporation. However, we will be required to pay federal income tax under
certain circumstances.

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or
association (i) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (ii) the
beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by
transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) which would be
taxable, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as a domestic
corporation; (iv) which is neither a financial institution nor an
insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) the
beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; (vi) during
the last half of each taxable year not more than 50% in value of the
outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or
fewer individuals; and (vii) which meets certain other tests, described
below, regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income
and assets. The Code provides that conditions (i) to (iv), inclusive, must
be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (v) must be met
during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months.

There are presently two gross income requirements.
First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from “prohibited
transactions” as defined below) for each taxable year must be derived directly
or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real
property or from certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at least
95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions)
for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75%
test and all other dividends, interest and gain from the sale or other
disposition of stock or securities. A “prohibited transaction” is a sale or
other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property) held for sale
to customers in the ordinary course of business.

At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we
must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at
least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate
assets, certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a
stock offering or long term public debt offering by us (but only for the
one-year period after such offering), cash, cash items and government
securities. Second, not more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by
securities other than those in the 75% asset class. Third, of the investments
included in the 25% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s securities owned
by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and we may not own
more than 10% of the vote or value of the securities of a non-REIT corporation,
other than certain debt securities and interests in taxable REIT subsidiaries
or qualified REIT subsidiaries, each as defined below. Fourth, not more than
20% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or
more taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We own interests in various partnerships and limited
liability companies. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership
or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership
under the Code, Treasury Regulations provide that for purposes of the REIT
income and asset tests, the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share
of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company (determined in
accordance with its capital interest in the entity), subject to special rules related
to the 10% asset test, and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the
partnership or limited liability company attributable to such share. The
ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a
REIT may involve special tax risks, including the challenge by the Internal
Revenue Service (the “Service”) of the allocations of income and expense items
of the partnership or limited liability company, which would affect the
computation of taxable income of the REIT, and the status of the partnership or
limited liability company as a partnership (as opposed to an association
taxable as a corporation) for federal income tax purposes.

We also own interests in a number of subsidiaries
which are intended to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries (each a “QRS”).
The Code provides that such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax
purposes and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit
of such subsidiaries will be


treated as our assets,
liabilities and such items. If any partnership, limited liability company, or
subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation
(and not as a partnership, QRS or taxable REIT subsidiary, as the case may be)
for federal income tax purposes, we would likely fail to satisfy the REIT asset
tests described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a REIT, unless
certain relief provisions apply. We believe that each of the partnerships,
limited liability companies, and subsidiaries (other than taxable REIT
subsidiaries) in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a
partnership, or disregarded entity (in the case of a 100% owned partnership or
limited liability company) or QRS, as applicable, although no assurance can be
given that the Service will not successfully challenge the status of any such
organization.

As of December 31, 2006, we owned interests in
two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries
(each a “TRS”). A REIT may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of
the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the REIT to be a TRS,
provided certain requirements are met. A TRS generally may engage in any
business, including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to
tenants of its parent REIT and of others, except a TRS may not manage or
operate a hotel or healthcare facility. A TRS is treated as a regular
corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income
and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates. In addition, a 100% tax may be
imposed on a REIT if its rental, service or other agreements with its TRS, or
the TRS’s agreements with the REIT’s tenants, are not on arm’s-length terms.

In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to
distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in
an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our “real
estate investment trust taxable income” (computed without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net
income, if any (after tax), from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum
of certain items of non-cash income. Such distributions must be paid in the
taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared
before we timely file our tax return for such year, if paid on or before the
first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect
and specify the dollar amount in our tax return. To the extent that we do not
distribute all of our net long-term capital gain or distribute at least 90%,
but less than 100%, of our “real estate investment trust taxable income”, as
adjusted, we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax
rates. Furthermore, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year
at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95%
of our capital gain income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed
taxable income from prior periods, we would be required to pay a 4% excise tax
on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually
distributed.

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any
taxable year, and certain relief provisions do not apply, we will be required
to pay tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable
income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in
which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required
to be made. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we
will also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to
state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory
relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce
distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial
indebtedness (to the extent borrowings are feasible) or liquidating substantial
investments in order to pay the resulting taxes.

We and our stockholders may be required to pay state
or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which
we or they transact business or reside. The state and local tax treatment of us
and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences
discussed above.


We may also be subject to
certain taxes applicable to REITs, including taxes in lieu of disqualification
as a REIT, on undistributed income, on income from prohibited transactions, on
net income from foreclosure property and on built-in gains from the sale of
certain assets acquired from C corporations in tax-free transactions.

Government
Regulation

The healthcare
industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local laws. This government
regulation of the healthcare industry affects us because:

(1)

Governmental regulations
such as licensure, certification for participation in government programs, and
government reimbursement may impact the financial ability of some of our
operators to make rent and debt payments to us, which in turn may affect the
value of our investments, and

(2)

The amount of
reimbursement such operators receive from the government and other third
parties may affect the amounts we receive in additional rents, which are often
based on our operators’ gross revenue from operations.

These laws and regulations are subject to frequent and
substantial changes resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and
regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law.
These changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or
impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and
the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. These
changes may be applied retroactively. The ultimate timing or effect of these
changes cannot be predicted. The failure of any tenant or borrower to comply
with such laws, regulations and requirements could affect its ability to
operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such operator’s
ability to make lease or debt payments to us, which in turn may affect the
value of our investments.

Fraud and Abuse Laws.

There
are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud and abusive business
practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from or
are in a position to make referrals in connection with a government-sponsored
healthcare program, including, but not limited to, the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. These include:

·

The
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer,
payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or
to induce, the referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients.

·

The
Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition (Stark), which restricts physicians
from making referrals for certain designated health services for which payment
may be made under Medicare or Medicaid programs to an entity with which the
physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship.

·

The
False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or
fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare
and Medicaid programs).

·

The
Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which is imposed by the Department of Health and
Human Services for fraudulent acts.

Each of these laws include criminal and/or civil
penalties for violations that range from punitive sanctions, damage
assessments, penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments,
and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Imposition of any of
these types of penalties on our tenants or borrowers could result in a material
adverse effect on their operations, which could adversely affect our business.
Additionally, certain laws, such as the False Claims Act, allow for individuals
to bring

qui tam

(whistleblower)
actions on behalf of the government for violations of fraud and abuse


laws. Some Medicare
Administrative Contractors (private companies that contract with Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to administer the Medicare
program) have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by skilled nursing
providers.

Environmental
Matters.

A wide variety of federal, state and
local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations
affect healthcare facility operations. Under various federal, state and local
environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a
secured lender (such as us) may be liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in
connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to
hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for
injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required
remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or
secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property,
and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of
such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such
substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such
property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, would
reduce our revenue. Although the mortgage loans that we provide and the leases
covering our properties require the borrower and the tenant to indemnify us for
certain environmental liabilities, the scope of such obligations may be limited
and we cannot assure that any such borrower or tenant would be able to fulfill
its indemnification obligations.

The
Medicare and Medicaid Programs.

Sources of
revenue for operators may include the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid
programs, private insurance carriers, healthcare service plans and health
maintenance organizations, among others. Efforts to reduce costs by these
payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in
reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators. In
addition, the failure of any of our operators to comply with various laws and
regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue to
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicaid programs differ
from state to state but they are all subject to federally-imposed requirements.
At least 50% of the funds available under these programs are provided by the
federal government under a matching program. Medicaid programs generally pay
for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates;
skilled nursing facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates.
Medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for tenant-operated facilities,
and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 may further reduce Medicaid
reimbursement, as the Act included cuts of approximately $4.8 billion over five
years to the Medicaid program. Increasingly, states have introduced managed
care contracting techniques into the administration of Medicaid programs. Such
mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement
to facilities. Other third-party payors in various states base payments on
costs, retail rates or, increasingly, negotiated rates. Negotiated rates can
include discounts from normal charges, fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated
rates.

Healthcare
Facilities.

The healthcare facilities in our
portfolio, including hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living
facilities, and physician group practice clinics, are subject to extensive
federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and
regulations. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of
accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or
decertification from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or
closure of the facility. Such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the
operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely
impact us.

Entrance
Fee Communities.

Certain of the senior housing
facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee
communities. Generally, an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid
by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form
of long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities are subject to
significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of
each facility’s financial condition, establishment and monitoring of reserve
requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel
their contracts within a


specified period of time,
lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership and
similar matters. Such oversight and the rights of residents within these
entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the
operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely impact us.

California Senate Bill
1953.

Our hospital located in Tarzana,
California is affected by State of California Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), which
requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital
facilities. This hospital is operated by Tenet under a lease expiring in February 2009.
We and Tenet are currently reviewing the SB 1953 compliance of this hospital,
multiple plans of action to cause such compliance, the estimated time for
completing the same, and the cost of performing necessary remediation of the
property. We cannot currently estimate the remediation costs that will need to
be incurred prior to 2013 in order to make the facility SB 1953-compliant
through 2030, or the final allocation of any remediation costs between us and
Tenet. Rent on the hospital in 2006 and 2005 was $10.8 million in each year and
the carrying amount of the facility is $73.9 million at December 31, 2006.

Current
Developments

The healthcare industry continues to face various
challenges, including increased government and private payor pressure on
healthcare providers to control costs, the migration of patients from acute
care facilities into extended care and home care settings, and the vertical and
horizontal consolidation of healthcare providers.

Changes in the law, new interpretations of existing
laws, and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the
definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs
associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by
government and other third-party payors. These changes may be applied
retroactively under certain circumstances. The ultimate timing or effect of
legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways.

In December of 2003, the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was signed into
law. The Act established an 18-month moratorium on the “whole hospital
exception” to the Stark law, whereby physicians have been permitted to refer
patients for Designated Health Services to hospitals in which they have an
ownership interest. On August 8, 2006, CMS released its final report and
plan to address issues relating to physician investment in specialty hospitals.
Specialty hospitals include hospitals primarily or exclusively engaged in the
care and treatment of cardiac conditions or orthopedic conditions, or hospitals
that perform certain surgical procedures. CMS’ strategic plan includes strict
enforcement of federal fraud and abuse laws for improper investments,
disclosure of information regarding physician investment and compensation
arrangements, acceptance of emergency transfer cases even if the specialty
hospital lacks an emergency department, and changes to the hospital inpatient
prospective and ambulatory surgical center payment systems. CMS declined to
extend the moratorium on approving new specialty hospitals, despite a request
for an extension by two senators. In light of continued interest in specialty
hospital regulation, there is a risk that legislation could be adopted that
affects the operation of specialty hospitals. The specialty hospital issue is
controversial and after significant discussion and legislation, the current
federal government permitted operation of specialty hospitals; however, there
can be no assurance that a new Congress or Administration would continue
similar treatment of specialty hospitals. Our hospital tenants may face
additional competition from an increased number of specialty hospitals,
including specialty hospitals owned by physicians currently on staff at tenant
hospitals.

In addition to the reforms enacted and considered by
Congress from time to time, state legislatures periodically consider various
healthcare reform proposals. Congress and state legislatures can be expected to
continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems, new
regulatory enforcement initiatives, and new payment methodologies.


We believe that government
and private efforts to contain or reduce healthcare costs will continue. These
trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for
certain services provided by some of our operators. In addition, recent trends
of hospitals providing more services to uninsured patients or on an outpatient
basis rather than inpatient basis may continue and could adversely affect the
profitability of our operators. We believe that the vast nature of the
healthcare industry, the financial strength and operating flexibility of our
operators, and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any
such trends. However, we cannot predict what legislation will be adopted, and
no assurance can be given that the healthcare reforms will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Employees

At December 31, 2006,
we had 165 full-time employees and no part-time employees, none of whom are
subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with
our employees to be good.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
Factors

You should
carefully consider the risks described below as well as the risks described in “Competition,”
“Government Regulation,” and “Taxation of HCP” and elsewhere in this report,
which risks are incorporated by reference into this section, before making an
investment decision regarding our company. The risks and uncertainties
described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional
risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely
to have a significant impact. All of these risks could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to
Our Operators

If our facility
operators are unable to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to
generate income, they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us.

The healthcare industry is
highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the
future. Our operators are subject to competition from other healthcare
providers that provide similar services. Such competition, which has
intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we operate, has
caused the fill-up rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly
rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to
obtain for their services to decrease. The profitability of healthcare
facilities depends upon several factors, including the number of physicians
using the healthcare facilities or referring patients there, competitive
systems of healthcare delivery and the size and composition of the population
in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state payment programs and the
effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on
the revenues and income of the properties. If our operators are not competitive
with other healthcare providers and are unable to generate income, they may be
unable to make rent and loan payments to us, which could adversely affect our
cash flow and financial performance and condition.

The bankruptcy,
insolvency or financial deterioration of our facility operators could
significantly delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find
new operators.

Our financial position and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by financial
difficulties experienced by any of our major operators, including bankruptcy,
insolvency or a general downturn in the business, or in the event any of our
major operators do not renew or extend their relationship with us as their
lease terms expire.

We are exposed to the risk
that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations, which may result
in their bankruptcy or insolvency. Although our leases and loans provide us the
right to terminate an investment, evict an operator, demand immediate repayment
and other remedies, the bankruptcy laws


afford
certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An
operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid
rents or interest during the bankruptcy proceeding.

Tenet Healthcare
Corporation and Sunrise Senior Living account for a significant percentage of
our revenues and are currently experiencing significant legal, financial and
regulatory difficulties.

During 2006, Tenet
Healthcare Corporation and Sunrise Senior Living accounted for approximately 9%
and 5%, respectively, of our revenues. The properties managed by Sunrise were
acquired from CRP on October 5, 2006. According to public disclosures,
Tenet and Sunrise are experiencing significant legal, financial and regulatory
difficulties. We cannot predict with certainty the impact, if any, of the
outcome of these uncertainties on our consolidated financial statements. The
failure or inability of Tenet or Sunrise to pay its obligations could
materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flows, which could adversely
affect the value of our common stock and could cause us to incur impairment
charges or a loss on the sale of the properties.

Our operators are
faced with increased litigation and rising insurance costs that may affect
their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments.

In some states, advocacy
groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare
facilities, and these groups have brought litigation against operators. Also,
in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning
very large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect of this litigation and
potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs incurred by our
operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition,
the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may
continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting
the operations of healthcare facilities continues. Continued cost increases
could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage
payments, potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and
litigation costs. Moreover, to the extent we are required to take back the
affected facilities, our revenue from those facilities could be reduced or
eliminated for an extended period of time.

Decline in the
skilled nursing sector and changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates
may have significant adverse consequences to us.

During 2006, our skilled
nursing properties accounted for approximately 7% of our revenues. Certain of
our skilled nursing operators and facilities continue to experience operating
problems in part due to a national nursing shortage, increased liability
insurance costs, and low levels of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. Due to
economic challenges facing many states, nursing homes will likely continue to
be under-funded. These challenges have had, and may continue to have, an
adverse effect on our long-term care facilities and facility operators.

We may rely on
credit enhancements to our leases for minimum rent payments.

Our leases may have credit
enhancement provisions, such as guarantees or shortfall reserves provided by
tenants or operators. These credit enhancement provisions may terminate at
either a specific time during the lease term or once net operating income of
the property exceeds a specified amount. These provisions may also have limits
on the overall amount of the credit enhancement. After the termination of a
credit enhancement, or in the event that the maximum limit of a credit
enhancement is reached, we may only look to the tenant to make lease payments. In
the event that a credit enhancement has expired or the maximum limit has been
reached, or in the event that a provider of a credit enhancement is unable to
meet its obligations, our results of operations and our cash available for
distribution could be adversely affected if our properties are unable to
generate sufficient funds from operations to meet minimum rent payments and the
tenants do not otherwise have the resources to make the rent payments. Our
tenants may be thinly


capitalized
entities that rely on the cash flow generated from the properties to fund rent
obligations under their lease.

Risks Related to Real Estate Investment and Our
Structure

We rely on external sources of capital to fund future
capital needs, and if our access to such capital is difficult or on
commercially unreasonable terms, we may not be able to meet maturing
commitments or make future investments necessary to grow our business.

In
order to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required,
among other things, to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of
our REIT taxable income. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not
be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection
with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, we rely on
external sources of capital. If we are unable to obtain needed capital at all
or only on unfavorable terms from these sources, we might not be able to make
the investments needed to grow our business, or to meet our obligations and
commitments as they mature, which could negatively affect the ratings of our
debt and even, in extreme circumstances, affect our ability to continue
operations. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which
we have little or no control, including:

·

general
market conditions;

·

the
market’s perception of our growth potential;

·

our
current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and

·

the market price of the
shares of our capital stock.

If we are unable to identify and purchase suitable
healthcare facilities at a favorable cost, we will be unable to continue to
grow through acquisitions.

Our ability to grow
through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to
identify suitable acquisition candidates that meet our criteria and are
compatible with our growth strategy. The acquisition and financing of
healthcare facilities at favorable costs is highly competitive. We may not be
successful in identifying suitable property or other assets that meet our
acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions on satisfactory terms or
at all. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare
facilities at favorable prices, or if we are unable to finance such
acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business will suffer.

Unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of
new properties could reduce our profitability.

Our business strategy
contemplates future acquisitions. The acquisitions we make may not prove to be
successful. We might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures
relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities. Further,
newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that
would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We might never realize the
anticipated benefits of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our
profitability.

Since real estate investments are illiquid, we may not
be able to sell properties when we desire.

Real
estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to vary
our portfolio promptly in response to changes in the real estate market. This
inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely
affect our ability to service our debt. The real estate market is affected by
many factors that are beyond our control, including:

·

adverse
changes in national and local economic and market conditions;

·

changes
in interest rates and in the availability, costs and terms of financing;


·

changes
in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning and other
ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations;

·

the
ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures;

·

changes
in operating expenses; and

·

civil
unrest, acts of war and natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods,
which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses.

We cannot predict whether
we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us,
or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be
acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a
willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. In addition, there are
provisions under the federal income tax laws applicable to REITs that may limit
our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets.
These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to
adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Transfers of
healthcare facilities generally require regulatory approvals, and alternative
uses of healthcare facilities are limited.

Because transfers of
healthcare facilities may be subject to regulatory approvals not required for
transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real
estate, there may be delays in transferring operations of our facilities to successor
operators or we may be prohibited from transferring operations to a successor
operator. In addition, substantially all of our properties are healthcare
facilities that may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. If we
are unable to transfer properties at times opportune to us, our revenue and
operations may suffer.

We may experience
uninsured or underinsured losses.

We generally require our
operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance
that covers us, as well as the operators, on most of our properties. Some types
of losses, however, either may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure
against. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur,
we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property,
as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event,
we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial
obligations related to the property. We cannot assure you that material losses
in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future.

Increases in
interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash
flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.

At December 31, 2006,
our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $6.2 billion, of
which approximately $1.7 billion, or 27%, is subject to variable interest
rates. This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 6.1% per annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate
debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and
our ability to service our indebtedness.

Our acquisition of
additional properties may have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity,
financial position, credit ratings and/or results of operations

As part of our business
strategy, we actively acquire healthcare facilities. Our recent acquisition of
CRP and CRC is an example of the execution of this strategy. We may acquire
healthcare facilities through various structures, including transactions
involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or
substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar real
estate entities. We


anticipate
that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods,
including proceeds from equity and/or debt offerings, advances under our credit
facilities and other incurrence or assumption of indebtedness. Any significant
acquisition or series of acquisitions financed by incurrence of indebtedness
may cause us to become highly leveraged and/or have a negative impact on the
credit ratings of our senior debt and preferred stock. Additionally, newly
acquired properties may fail to perform as expected. Inaccurate assumptions
regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic
estimates of future revenues. Similarly, we may underestimate future operating
expenses or the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards
established for its intended market position.

If we are unable to successfully integrate the
operations of CRP and other target companies, our business and earnings
may be negatively affected.

Mergers involve the
integration of companies that have previously operated independently.
Successful integration of the operations of these companies depend primarily on
our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and
personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs. Mergers also pose other
risks commonly associated with similar transactions, including unanticipated
liabilities, unexpected costs and the diversion of management’s attention to
the integration of our operations with those of the target companies. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to integrate CRP or other target companies’
operations without encountering difficulties, including, but not limited to,
the loss of key employees, the disruption of its respective ongoing businesses
or possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.
Estimated cost savings are projected to come from various areas that our
management has identified through the due diligence and integration planning
process. If we have difficulties with any of these areas, we might not achieve
the economic benefits we expect to result from the merger, and this
may hurt our business and earnings. In addition, we may experience
greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to the integration of the
business of CRP or other target companies and/or may not realize expected
cost savings from mergers within the expected time frame, if at all.

Our business could be adversely impacted if we have
deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over
financial reporting.

The design and
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or
misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial
reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the
time. In certain circumstances, the effectiveness of internal controls is
dependent on information received from independent third parties. For example,
we consolidate our investments in certain variable interest entities (“VIEs”)
when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If
management of the consolidated VIEs fails to provide us necessary financial
information either in a timely manner or at all, it could adversely impact our financial
reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting. Deficiencies,
including any material weakness, in our internal controls over financial
reporting, which may occur in the future, could result in misstatements of our
results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in
our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business,
reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

We lease 76 properties to
a total of 9 tenants that have been identified as VIEs. We acquired these
leases (variable interests) on October 5, 2006 in our acquisition of CRP. CRP
determined they were not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, and we are
generally required to carry forward CRP’s accounting conclusions after the
acquisition relative to their primary beneficiary assessment. We may need to
reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary in the future upon the
occurrence of a reconsideration event, as defined by FIN 46R. If we determine
that we are the primary beneficiary in the future and consolidate the


tenant,
our financial statements would reflect the tenant’s facility level revenues and
expenses rather than lease revenue.

Federal Income Tax Risks

Loss of our tax status as a REIT would have
significant adverse consequences to us.

We currently operate and
have operated commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1985 in
a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Qualification as a REIT
involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code
provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances
not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.
For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in
any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must satisfy a number
of requirements regarding the composition of our assets. Also, we must make
distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT
taxable income, excluding capital gains. In addition, new legislation,
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely
affect our investors or our ability to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes.
Although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in such
manner, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to
qualify as a REIT for tax purposes.

If we
lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will
substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and
interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to our
stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT:

·

we
would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing
our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates;

·

we
also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly
increased state and local taxes; and

·

unless
we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be
subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which
we were disqualified.

In addition, if we fail to
qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as
regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated
earnings and profits and we would not be required to make distributions to
stockholders.

As a result of all these
factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to
expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of
our common stock.

Certain property transfers may generate prohibited
transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the
transaction.

From time to time, we may
transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal
Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as
inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business
would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100%
penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not
believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are properly
treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for
investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and
circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue
Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are
prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service
would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Service were to
argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a
prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on
any gain allocable to us from the


prohibited
transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely
affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real
estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes.

As a result of the CRP merger and the CRC merger, we
may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from CRP and CRC.

Prior to the CRP merger,
CRP was organized as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. If CRP failed to
qualify as a REIT for any of its taxable years, it would be required to pay
federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless statutory relief provisions
apply, CRP would have been disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four
taxable years following the year during which it lost qualification. Because
the CRP merger was treated for income tax purposes as if CRP sold all of its
assets in a taxable transaction to us, if CRP did not qualify as a REIT for the
taxable year of the merger, it would be subject to tax in respect of the
built-in gain in all of its assets. “Built-in gain” generally means the excess
of the fair market value of an asset over its adjusted tax basis. As
successor-in-interest to CRP, we would be required to pay these taxes. After
the merger, the nature of the assets that we acquired from CRP and the income
we derive from those assets may have an effect on our tax status as a REIT.

In connection with the CRP
merger, CRP’s REIT counsel rendered an opinion to us, dated as of the closing
date of the merger, to the effect that CRP qualified as a REIT under the Code
for the taxable years ending December 31, 1999 generally through December 31,
2005, CRP was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification
as a REIT, and CRP’s method of operation had enabled CRP to satisfy the
requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code for the taxable years
ending on or prior to the closing date of the merger. This opinion was based on
various assumptions and representations as to factual matters, including
representations made by CRP in a factual certificate provided by one of its
officers, as well as other oral and written statements of officers and other
representatives of CRP and others as to the existence and consequence of
certain factual and other matters.

As a result of the CRC
merger, we succeeded to the assets and the liabilities of CRC, including any
liabilities for unpaid taxes and any tax liabilities created in connection with
the CRC merger. At the closing of the CRC merger, we received an opinion of CRC’s
counsel, and CRC and its stockholders received an opinion of their counsel,
substantially to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations
and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions, for federal income
tax purposes the CRC merger qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. To the extent that the CRC merger so
qualified, no gain or loss was recognized by CRC or us in the CRC merger. If
the CRC merger did not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, the CRC merger would have been treated as a sale of CRC’s assets to
HCP in a taxable transaction, and CRC would have recognized taxable gain. In
such a case, as CRC’s successor-in-interest, we would be required to pay the
tax on any such gain.

Assuming that the CRC
merger qualified as a reorganization under the Code, we succeeded to the tax
attributes and earnings and profits of CRC. To qualify as a REIT, we must
distribute such earnings and profits by the close of the taxable year in which
the CRC merger occurred. Any adjustments of CRC’s income for taxable years
ending on or before the CRC merger, including as a result of an examination of
CRC’s tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, could affect the calculation
of CRC’s earnings and profits. If the Internal Revenue Service were to
determine that we acquired earnings and profits from CRC that we failed to
distribute prior to the end of the taxable year in which the CRC merger
occurred, we could avoid disqualification as a REIT by using “deficiency
dividend” procedures. Under these procedures, we generally would be required to
distribute any such earnings and profits to our stockholders within 90 days of
the determination and pay a statutory interest charge at a specified rate to
the Internal Revenue Service.


The opinions of counsel
delivered in connection with the CRP merger and the CRC merger represent the
best legal judgment of counsel and are not binding on the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts. None of us, CRP or CRC has requested nor will request a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the status of CRP as a REIT or
the tax consequences of the CRC merger, and there can be no assurance that the
Internal Revenue Service will agree with the conclusions in the above-described
opinions.

Senior housing
facilities are apartment-like facilities and are therefore stated in units
(studio, one or two bedroom apartments). Medical office buildings and other
healthcare facilities are measured in square feet. Hospitals and skilled
nursing facilities are measured by licensed bed count.

(2)

Investment for owned
properties represents the carrying amount of real estate assets, including
intangibles, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization, and
excludes assets held for sale and classified as discontinued operations.

(3)

On
January 5, 2007, we formed a joint venture for 25 senior housing assets
and retained a 35% interest in the venture. The carrying value of the 25 senior
housing facilities is classified as real estate held for contribution on our
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. On October 13, 2006,
we formed a joint venture with 13 MOBs and retained an effective 26% interest
in the venture. The disposition of a portion of our interest in the 25
senior housing assets and 13 MOBs met the definition


under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS No. 144”) for the
assets to qualify as held for sale, however, the operations are not classified
as discontinued operations resulting from our continuing interest in the
ventures. The operating results of these properties prior to the formation of
the ventures are included in the Company’s continuing operations. The number of
properties, capacity, square footage, and investment for the 13 MOBs are
included under the caption of unconsolidated joint ventures.

additional buildings, the contributing entities received 184,169 non-managing
member units subsequent to the initial closing. An additional 93,276
non-managing member units were received by the contributing entities as a

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Cautionary Language
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Statements in this
Annual Report that are not historical factual statements are “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. The statements include, among other things, statements regarding the
intent, belief or expectations of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and
its officers and can be identified by the use of terminology such as “may,” “will,”
“expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “should” and other
comparable terms or the negative thereof. In addition, we, through our senior
management, from time to time make forward-looking oral and written public
statements concerning our expected future operations and other developments.
Readers are cautioned that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good
faith belief and best judgment based upon current information, they are not
guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and
uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the expectations
contained in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. In
addition to the factors set forth under “Part I, Item–A—Risk Factors” in
this Annual Report, readers should consider the following:

(a)

Legislative, regulatory,
or other changes in the healthcare industry at the local, state or federal
level which increase the costs of, or otherwise affect the operations of, our
tenants and borrowers;

(b)

Changes in the
reimbursement available to our tenants and borrowers by governmental or private
payors, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment levels and the
availability and cost of third-party insurance coverage;

(c)

Competition for tenants
and borrowers, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the
renewal or rollover of existing leases;

(d)

Availability of suitable
healthcare facilities to acquire at favorable prices and the competition for
such acquisition and financing of healthcare facilities;

(e)

The ability of our
tenants and borrowers to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to
maintain or increase revenues and to generate sufficient income to make rent
and loan payments;

(f)

The financial weakness
of some operators, including potential bankruptcies, which results in
uncertainties regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of
such operators’ leases;

(g)

Changes in national or
regional economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the
availability and cost of capital;

(h)

The risk that we will not
be able to sell or lease facilities that are currently vacant;

(i)

The potential costs of
SB 1953 compliance with respect to our hospital in Tarzana, California;

(j)

The financial, legal
and regulatory difficulties of significant operators of our properties,
including Tenet, HealthSouth and Sunrise;

(k)

The potential impact of
existing and future litigation matters; and

(l)

Our ability to achieve
expected synergies, operating efficiencies and other benefits within expected
time-frames or at all, or within expected cost projections, to execute our
delevering strategy and to preserve the goodwill of the acquired businesses.

We undertake no obligation
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.


Executive Summary

We are a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that
invests in healthcare-related properties primarily located throughout the
United States. We develop, acquire and manage healthcare real estate and
provide mortgage financing to healthcare providers. We invest directly, often
structuring sale-leaseback transactions, and through joint ventures. At December 31,
2006, our real estate portfolio, excluding assets held for sale but including
assets held through joint ventures and mortgage loans, consisted of interests
in 731 facilities.

Our business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic
investing, (ii) portfolio diversification and (iii) conservative
financing. We actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return
potential into assets with higher return potential, and recycle capital from
shorter-term to longer-term investments. We make investments where the expected
risk-adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our
operator and other business relationships.

Our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing
properties on favorable terms. We attempt to structure transactions that are
tax-advantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process. Generally, we
prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our management
team’s experience and our infrastructure. In addition, we follow a disciplined
approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including the
ongoing evaluation of properties that no longer fit our strategy for potential
disposition.

We primarily generate revenue by leasing
healthcare-related properties under long-term leases. Most of our rents and
other earned income from leases are received under triple-net leases; however,
MOB rents are typically structured as gross or modified gross leases.
Accordingly, for MOBs we incur certain property operating expenses, such as
real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities
and insurance. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase
rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing occupancy
levels and rental rates, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying
lease structures, and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our
operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic
and other conditions.

Access to external capital on favorable terms is
critical to the success of our strategy. We attempt to match the long-term
duration of our leases with long-term fixed-rate financing. At December 31,
2006, 27% of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates, which
includes a $0.5 billion term loan that was used to pay the cash consideration
of our merger with CRP. We repaid the remaining balance of the term loan with
proceeds from our January 2007 capital market transactions, which further
reduced our variable interest rate exposure. We intend to maintain an
investment grade rating on our fixed income securities and manage various
capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters. As of December 31,
2006, our senior debt is rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group,
BBB by Fitch Ratings and Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service.

Capital market access
impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness
as it matures, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through
the issuance of additional securities. Our ability to access capital on
favorable terms is dependent on various factors, including general market
conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our
potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the market price of our
capital stock.

On October 5, 2006,
we closed our merger with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CRP”) for
aggregate consideration of approximately $5.3 billion. In the CRP merger, we
paid an aggregate of $2.9 billion of cash, issued 22.8 million shares of
our common stock, and we either assumed or refinanced


approximately
$1.7 billion of CRP’s outstanding debt. We initially financed the cash consideration
paid to CRP stockholders and the expenses related to the transaction through an
offering of senior notes, a draw down under new term and bridge loan facilities
and a new three-year revolving credit facility. Our results of operations for
2006 include the results of the combined company beginning on October 5,
2006. For more information about the CRP merger, see Note 5 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Simultaneous with the
closing of the merger with CRP, we also merged with CNL Retirement Corp. (“CRC”)
for aggregate consideration of approximately $120 million, which included the
issuance of 4.4 million shares of our common stock.

Investment Transactions

During
2006, including the CRP merger discussed above, we acquired interests in
properties aggregating $5.9 billion with an average yield of 6.9%. Our 2006
investments were made in the following healthcare sectors: (i) 77% senior
housing facilities; (ii) 19% MOBs; (iii) 3% hospitals; and (iv) 1%
other healthcare facilities. Our 2006 real estate investments included the
following:

·

During
the three months ended March 31, 2006, we acquired 13 medical office
buildings for $138 million, including non-managing member LLC units
(“DownREIT units”) valued at $6 million, in related transactions. The 13
buildings, with 730,000 rentable square feet, have an initial yield of 7.3%.

·

On
May 31, 2006, we acquired nine assisted living and independent living
facilities for $99 million, including assumed debt valued at $61 million,
through a sale-leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial lease
term of ten years, with two ten-year renewal options. The initial annual lease
rate is approximately 8.0% with annual CPI-based escalators.

·

On
November 30, 2006, we acquired four assisted living and independent living
facilities for $51 million, through a sale-leaseback transaction. These
facilities have an initial lease term of ten years, with two ten-year renewal
options. The initial annual lease rate is approximately 8.0% with annual
escalators based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”).

During 2006, we sold 83
properties for $512 million and recognized gains of approximately $275 million.
These sales included 69 SNFs sold on December 1, 2006, for $392 million
with gains of approximately $226 million. On or before December 1, 2006,
tenants for nine SNFs exercised rights of first refusal to acquire such
facilities. The sales of the nine SNFs for $52 million are expected to be
completed by June 30, 2007.

On November 17, 2006, we purchased $300 million
senior secured notes issued by a HCA Inc. These notes accrue interest at
9.625%, mature on November 15, 2016, and are secured by second-priority
liens on the HCA’s and its subsidiary guarantors’ assets.

On January 31, 2007,
we acquired three long-term acute care hospitals and received proceeds of $36 million
in exchange for 11 skilled nursing facilities valued at approximately $77
million. The three acquired properties have an initial lease term of ten years
with two ten-year renewal options, and initial contractual yield of 12% with
escalators based on the lessee’s revenue growth. The acquired properties are
included in a new master lease that contains 14 properties leased to the same
operator.

On February 9, 2007,
we acquired the Medical City Dallas campus, which includes two hospital towers,
six medical office buildings, and three parking garages, for approximately $347
million, including non-managing member LLC units (“DownREIT units’’) valued at
$174 million. The initial yield on this campus is approximately 7.3%.


Joint Venture
Transactions

On October 27, 2006, we formed an MOB joint
venture with an institutional capital partner. The joint venture includes 13
properties valued at $140 million and encumbered by $92 million of mortgage
debt. Upon formation, we received approximately $36 million in proceeds,
including a one-time acquisition fee of $0.7 million. We retained an effective
26% interest in the venture, will act as the managing member, and will receive
ongoing asset management fees.

On November 30, 2006, we acquired the interest
held by an affiliate of General Electric Company (“GE”) in HCP Medical Office
Portfolio, LLC (“HCP MOP”), for $141 million. We are now the sole owner of the
venture and its 59 MOBs, which have approximately four million rentable square
feet. At closing, $251 million of mortgage debt encumbered these MOBs.

On January 5, 2007,
we formed a senior housing joint venture with an institutional capital partner.
The joint venture includes 25 properties valued at $1.1 billion and encumbered
by a $686 million secured debt facility. Upon formation, we received
approximately $280 million in proceeds, including a one-time acquisition fee of
$5.4 million. Including the $446 million recently received from the secured
debt facility with Fannie Mae discussed below, we received $726 million in
total proceeds. We retained a 35% interest in the venture, will act as the
managing member, and will receive ongoing asset management fees.

Capital Market
Transactions

During 2006, in addition to the mortgage debt issued
under the Fannie Mae facility discussed below, we obtained $165 million of
ten-year mortgage financing with a weighted average effective yield of 6.36% in
five separate transactions. We received net proceeds of $162 million, which
were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate
purposes.

On February 27, 2006, we issued $150 million of
5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes were priced at 99.071% of
the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.788%. We received net proceeds
of $149 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for
other general corporate purposes.

On September 19, 2006, we issued $1 billion of
senior unsecured notes, which consisted of $300 million of floating rate
notes due in 2008, $300 million of 5.95% notes due in 2011, and $400 million of
6.30% notes due in 2016. We received net proceeds of $994 million, which
together with cash on hand and borrowings under the new credit facilities were
used to repay our then existing credit facility and to finance the CRP merger.

On October 5, 2006, in connection with the CRP
merger, we entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks providing
for aggregate borrowings of $3.4 billion. The credit facilities included a $0.7 billion
bridge loan, a $1.7 billion two-year term loan, and a $1.0 billion three-year
revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2006, we had repaid the
bridge loan and borrowings under the term loan were reduced to $0.5 billion. In
addition, through our capital market transactions in January 2007, we
fully repaid the balance outstanding under the term loan.

On November 10, 2006, we issued 33.5 million
shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $960 million,
which were used to repay our bridge loan facility and borrowings under our term
loan and revolving credit facilities.

On December 4, 2006, we issued $400 million of
5.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes were priced at 99.768% of
the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.69%. We received net proceeds
of $396 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term loan
facility.

On December 21, 2006, in anticipation of our
senior housing joint venture that closed on January 5, 2007, we expanded
an existing secured debt facility with Fannie Mae to $686 million, receiving
$446 million


in proceeds. The Fannie
Mae facility bears interest at a weighted average rate of 5.66%. The funds from
the expanded debt facility were used to repay borrowings under our term loan
facility.

On January 19, 2007, we issued 6.8 million shares
of common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $261 million, which
were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility.

On January 22, 2007,
we issued $500 million of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes
were priced at 99.323% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.09%.
We received net proceeds of $493 million, which were used to repay borrowings
under our term loan and revolving credit facilities.

Other Events

During the year ended December 31, 2006, we
issued approximately 797,000 shares of our common stock under our Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of $28.68
for proceeds of $22.9 million.

Quarterly dividends paid
during 2006 aggregated $1.70 per share. On January 29, 2007, we announced
that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of
$0.445 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 21,
2007, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 5,
2007. The annualized rate of distribution for 2007 is $1.78, compared with
$1.70 for 2006, which represents a 4.7% increase. Our Board of Directors has
determined to continue its policy of considering dividend increases on an
annual rather than quarterly basis.

Critical Accounting
Policies

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) requires management to use judgment in the application of
accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base
estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the
facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had
been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been
applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements.
From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event
estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments
are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and
assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Principles of
Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of HCP, its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled, through
voting rights or other means, joint ventures. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

We have adopted Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, as revised (“FIN 46R”),
effective January 1, 2004 for variable interest entities created before February 1,
2003 and effective in fiscal year 2003 for variable interest entities created
after January 31, 2003. FIN 46R provides guidance on the identification of
entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable
interest entities” or “VIEs”) and the determination of which business
enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A variable interest entity is
broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a
group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities
without additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments
in VIEs when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of


the VIE at either the
creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a
reconsideration event. The adoption of FIN 46R resulted in the consolidation of
five joint ventures with aggregate assets of $18.5 million, effective January 1,
2004, that were previously accounted for under the equity method. The
consolidation of these joint ventures did not have a significant effect on our
consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

We lease 76 properties to a total of 9 tenants that
have been identified as VIEs. We acquired these leases (variable interests) on October 5,
2006 in our acquisition of CRP. CRP determined they were not the primary
beneficiary of the VIEs, and we are generally required to carry forward CRP’s
accounting conclusions after the acqusition relative to their primary
beneficiary assessment. We may need to reassess whether we are the primary
beneficiary in the future upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event, as
defined by FIN 46R. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary in the
future and consolidate the tenant, our financial statements would reflect the tenant’s
facility level revenues and expenses rather than lease revenue. Our maximum
exposure to losses resulting from our involvement in these VIEs is limited to
the future minimum lease payments to be received from these leases, which
totaled $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2006. If we are required to
consolidate any VIE in the future, we will depend on the VIE to provide us
timely financial information, and we will rely on the internal controls of the
VIE. If the VIE does not provide us with timely financial information, or has
deficiencies in its financial reporting internal controls, this may adversely
impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial
reporting.

We adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”)
04-5,

Investor’s Accounting for an Investment in a
Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the
Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”), effective June 2005.
The issue concludes as to what rights held by the limited partner(s) preclude
consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would
otherwise consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with GAAP. The
assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of
control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made
when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there
is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited
partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its
ownership of limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase
or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. This
EITF also applies to managing members in limited liability companies. The
adoption of EITF 04-5 did not have an impact on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

Investments in entities
which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under
the equity method. Generally, under the equity method of accounting, our share
of the investee’s earnings or loss is included in our operating results.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income from tenants
is recognized in accordance with GAAP, including Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB 104”). For
leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a
straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably
assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results
in recognized revenue exceeding amounts contractually due from tenants. Such
cumulative excess amounts are included in other assets and were $35.6 million
and $18.4 million, net of allowances, at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight-line
rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts
contractually owed, and, where appropriate, we establish an allowance for
estimated losses. Certain leases provide for additional rents based upon a percentage
of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base periods or other
thresholds. Such revenue is deferred until the related thresholds are achieved.


We monitor the liquidity
and creditworthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an ongoing basis. This
evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance,
security deposits and guarantees, and other matters. We establish provisions
and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the possible
inability of our tenants and borrowers to make payments sufficient to recover
recognized assets. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on
income recoverable over the term of the lease. At December 31, 2006 and
2005, we had an allowance of $29.7 million and $21.6 million, respectively,
included in other assets, as a result of our determination that collectibility
is not reasonably assured for certain straight-line rent amounts.

Real Estate

Real estate, consisting of
land, buildings, and improvements, is recorded at cost. We allocate the cost of
the acquisition to the acquired tangible and identified intangible assets and
liabilities, primarily lease related intangibles, based on their estimated fair
values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141,

Business Combinations

.

We assess fair value based
on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or
capitalization rates, third-party appraisals, and available market information.
Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including
historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and
economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired
property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.

We record acquired “above
and below” market leases at their fair value, using a discount rate which
reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired, equal to the difference
between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place
lease and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each
corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining
term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of
any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other
intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are
based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease.
Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during
hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute
similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost
rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local
market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider
leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We assess the carrying
value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and,
with respect to goodwill, at least annually applying a fair-value-based test. If
the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of the long-lived asset, an impairment loss will be recognized
by adjusting the asset’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value. The
determination of the fair value of long-lived assets, including goodwill,
involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on our analysis and
estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each
long-lived asset. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results
and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value.

Net Investment in Direct Financing Leases

We use the direct finance
method of accounting to record income from direct financing leases. For leases
accounted for as direct financing leases, future minimum lease payments are
recorded as a receivable. The difference between the rents receivable and the
estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as
unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the
lease terms to provide a constant rate of return. Investments in direct financing
leases are presented net of unamortized unearned income. Direct financing
leases have initial terms that range from


5 to 35
years and provide for minimum annual rent. Certain leases contain provisions
that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the properties during or at the end
of the lease terms for the aggregate initial investment amount plus
adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements. Certain leases also
permit the Company to require the tenants to purchase the properties at the end
of the lease terms.

Results of
Operations

Comparison
of the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31,

On October 5, 2006, we completed our merger with
CRP. On November 30, 2006, we acquired the interest held by an affiliate
of GE in HCP MOP, which resulted in the consolidation of HCP MOP beginning on
that date. The impact on various income statement line items from our merger
with CRP and consolidation of HCP MOP are discussed below.

Rental
and related revenue.

MOB
rental revenue increased 49.5% or $62.8 million to $189.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $23.4 million of the increase
relates to MOBs acquired in the CRP merger and $5.9 million relates to the
consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in MOB rental income primarily
relates to the additive effect or our MOB acquisitions in 2006 and 2005.

Triple-net
leased rental revenues increased 36.1% or $97.4 million to $367.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $56.5 million of the
increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger. The remaining
increase in triple-net lease rental revenue of $40.9 million primarily relates
to rent escalations and resets, and the additive effect of our other
acquisitions in 2006 and 2005, as detailed below:

Additionally, included in triple-net lease rental
revenues are facility-level operating revenues for five senior housing
properties that were previously leased on a triple-net basis. Periodically
tenants default on their leases, which cause us to take temporary possession of
the operations of the facility. We contract with third-party managers to manage
these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property
can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are
included in triple-net lease rental revenues and operating expenses,
respectively. The increase in reported revenues for these facilities of $1.9
million to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, was
primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and an
increase in overall occupancy of such properties.

Earned
income from direct financing leases.

Earned income from direct financing leases of $15
million relates to 32 leased properties acquired from CRP which are accounted
for using the direct financing method. At December 31, 2006, these leased
properties had a carrying value of $678 million and accrue interest at a
weighted average rate of 9.0%.

Equity
income.

Equity
income increased by $9.5 million to $8.3 million primarily due to our
investment in HCP MOP, for which we recorded equity income of $7.8 million and
equity losses of $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively. During the year ended


December 31, 2006,
HCP MOP sold 34 MOBs for approximately $100.7 million, net of transaction
costs, and recognized aggregate gains of $19.7 million. See Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on HCP MOP. On November 30,
2006, we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of GE in HCP MOP, which
resulted in us becoming the sole owner of HCP MOP and consolidating its results
of operations beginning on that date.

On October 27, 2006, we formed HCP Ventures III,
LLC (“HCP Ventures III”), a joint venture with an institutional capital partner,
with 13 of our previously 85% owned properties. Beginning on October 27,
2006, HCP Ventures III, in which we retained an effective 26% interest, has
been accounted for as an equity method investment.

Investment
management fee income.

Management and other fee
income increased by $0.7 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition fee earned from HCP
Ventures III of $0.7 million on October 27, 2006.

Interest
and other income.

Interest and other income
increased by $11.9 million to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. The increase was primarily related to $3.5 million of interest income
from a $300 million investment in senior secured notes receivable purchased on November 17,
2006, which accrue interest at a rate of 9.625%. In addition, we recognized
income of $7.3 million in connection with a prepayment premium we received in
the second quarter of 2006, upon the early repayment of a secured loan
receivable of $30.0 million with an original maturity of May 1, 2010 and
an interest rate of 11.4%.

Interest
expense.

Interest expense increased $106.1
million to $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Approximately $42.1 million of the increase was due to the assumption of $1.3
billion of CRP’s outstanding debt and interest related to our term and bridge loans
which were used to fund the CRP merger. In addition, we wrote off the
unamortized balance of deferred financing fees from the refinancing of our
previous revolving line of credit and the early repayment of our bridge loan
and portions of our term loan which in the aggregate resulted in interest
expense of $9.0 million. The remaining increase was due to increased borrowing
levels resulting from the issuance of senior notes, issuance of additional
mortgages, and increased borrowing levels on our existing revolving credit
facility. This higher interest expense was offset by the repayment of an
aggregate of $255 million of senior notes in February and October 2006.
As of December 31, 2006, we had repaid the bridge loan and borrowings
under the term loan were reduced to $0.5 billion. In addition, through our
capital market transactions in January 2007, we fully repaid the balance
outstanding under the term loan.

Depreciation and
amortization.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased 52% or $49.4 million to $144.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $29.0 million of the
increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger and $1.6 million
relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in depreciation
and amortization of $18.8 million primarily relates to the additive effect of
our other acquisitions in 2006 and 2005.

Operating expenses.

Operating costs increased 50.4% or
$29.9 million to $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Approximately $8.6 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in
the CRP merger and $3.4 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP.
Operating costs are predominantly related to MOB properties that are leased
under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs
with tenants. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB portfolio
directly impacts operating costs. Additionally, we contract with third-party property
managers for most of our MOB properties. The remaining increase in operating
expenses of $17.9 million primarily relates to the effect of our other property
acquisitions in 2006 and 2005, as detailed below:

Additionally, included in
operating expenses are facility-level operating expenses for five senior
housing properties that were previously leased on a triple-net basis.
Periodically tenants default on their leases, which cause us to take temporary
possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third-party
managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be
identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for
these properties are included in triple-net lease rental revenues and operating
expenses, respectively. The increase in reported operating expenses for these
facilities of $2.8 million to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2006, was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in
2005 and an increase in overall occupancy of such properties.

The presentation of expenses as general and
administrative and operating expenses is based on the underlying nature of the
expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between
categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the
expense.

General and administrative
expenses.

General
and administrative expenses increased 48.6% or $15.5 million to $47.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily due to
higher compensation-related expenses of approximately $9.0 million resulting
from an increase in full-time employees. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
full-time employees were 165 and 83, respectively. In addition, during 2006 we
incurred $5.0 million in merger and integration-related expenses associated
with the CRC and CRP mergers. We expect to incur integration costs associated
with the CRP merger through 2007.

Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations
for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $310.9 million compared to $57.5
million for the comparable period in the prior year. The change is due to an
increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $259.1 million, net of
impairments, and a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of
$5.7 million. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
2006, includes 113 properties compared to 122 properties classified as
discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the
year ended December 31, 2006, we sold 83 properties for $512 million as
compared to 18 properties for $65 million during the year ended
December 31, 2005.


Comparison of the
year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004

Rental and related
revenue.

MOB
rental revenue increased 35.4% to $126.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2005. The increase in MOB rental revenue of $33.2 million primarily relates to
the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, which contributed
$26.7 million to rental revenues year over year.

Triple-net
lease rental revenues increased 15.2% to $269.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2005. The increase in triple-net lease rental revenue of $35.7 million
primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004,
as detailed below:

We also recognized $5.7
million of rental income during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a
change in an estimate related to the collectibility of straight-line rental
income from ARC. Additionally, included in triple-net lease rental revenues are
facility-level operating revenues for five senior housing properties that were
previously leased on a triple-net basis. Periodically tenants default on their
leases, which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the
facility. We contract with third-party managers to manage these properties
until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The
operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triple-net
lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in
reported revenues for these facilities of $3.6 million to $7.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to us taking
possession of two of these properties in 2005 and increases in overall
occupancy of such properties.

Equity income (loss).

Equity income decreased to a loss of $1.1
million primarily due to our investment in HCP MOP, for which we recorded
equity losses of $1.4 million and equity income of $1.5 million for 2005
and 2004, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
HCP MOP revised its purchase price allocation and attributed more of the
purchase price of the properties acquired from MedCap Properties, LLC to
below-market lease intangibles and other intangibles from real estate assets.
Lease intangibles generally amortize over a shorter period of time relative to
tangible real estate assets. The decrease in the equity income from our
investment in HCP MOP was primarily due to the revisions to the purchase price
allocations referred to above. Additionally, HCP MOP incurred repairs and other
related expenses for damages caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita of $1.4
million during the year ended December 31, 2005. See Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on HCP MOP.

Investment management fee
income.

Management
and other fee income decreased by $0.1 million to $3.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005.

Interest and other income.

Interest and other income decreased 30.0%
or $9.8 million to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
change reflects a reduced level of loans receivable following an $83 million
repayment from ARC and a $17 million repayment from Emeritus during the third
quarter of 2004. The decrease in interest and other income was partially offset
by gains from the sale of various investments of $4.5 million in 2005. The
gains from these investments were primarily the result of the sale of
securities in 2005, which were acquired in conjunction with real estate and or
leasing transactions we completed in previous years.


Interest expense.

Interest expense increased 22.3% to $107.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due to the
issuance of $450 million of senior notes payable in April and September of
2005, the assumption of $113.5 million of mortgage notes payable in connection
with the acquisitions of real estate properties, and an overall increase in
short-term variable rates. The table below sets forth information with respect
to our debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004:

Depreciation and

amortization of $22.4 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our
acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, as detailed below:

Operating expenses.

Operating costs increased 39.6% to $59.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating costs are
predominantly related to MOB properties that are leased under gross or modified
gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants. Accordingly,
the number of properties in our MOB portfolio directly impacts operating costs.
The increase in operating expenses of $16.8 million primarily relates to the
effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, as detailed below:

Additionally, included in operating expenses are
facility-level operating expenses for five senior housing properties that were
previously leased on a triple-net basis. Periodically tenants default on their
leases, which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the
facility. We contract with third-party managers to manage these properties
until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The
operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triple-net
lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in
reported operating expenses for these facilities of $3.6 million to $8.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to us
taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and an increase in the
overall occupancy of such properties.

The presentation of expenses between general and
administrative and operating expenses is based on the underlying nature of the
expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between
categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the
expense.

General
and administrative expenses.

General
and administrative expenses decreased 13.2% to $31.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005. The decrease was due to higher costs in 2004 primarily
resulting from $1.5 million of income tax expense on income from certain assets
held in a taxable REIT subsidiary, the implementation of a new information
system, considerable resources that were expended towards initial compliance
with certain regulatory requirements, principally Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, $0.7 million in expenses associated with the
relocation of our corporate offices to Long Beach, California in 2004 and a
charge of $1.6 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against us
by our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Offsetting
the decrease from 2004 was an increase in compensation-related expenses due to
an increase in full-time employees from 74 at December 31, 2004, to 83 at December 31,
2005.

Discontinued operations.

Income
from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
$57.5 million compared to $54.9 million for the comparable period in the prior
year. The change is due to an increase in the year over year gains on sale of
real estate of $5.7 million and a decline of operating income of $3.2 million
associated with discontinued operations.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Our principal liquidity needs are to (i) fund
normal operating expenses, (ii) repay remaining portions of the CRP
merger-related borrowings, (iii) meet debt service requirements, (iv) fund
capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs, (v) fund
acquisition and development activities, and (vi) make minimum
distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended. We repaid remaining portions of the CRP
merger-related borrowings through our joint venture and capital market
transactions in January 2007. We believe these other needs will be
satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing
activities.

We anticipate making future investments dependent on
the availability of cost-effective sources of capital. We intend to use our
revolving credit facility, and the public debt and equity markets as our
principal sources of financing. As of December 31, 2006, our senior debt
is rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, BBB by Fitch Ratings
and Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $334
million and $282 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash flow from
operations reflects increased revenues partially offset by higher costs and
expenses, and changes in receivables, payables, accruals, and deferred revenue.
Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of
multi-tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants’ performance on
their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors.

Net cash used in investing activities was $3.7 billion
during 2006 and principally reflects the net effect of: (i) $3.3 billion
used to acquire CRP, (ii) $618 million used to fund acquisitions and
construction of real


estate, (iii) $512
million received from the sale of facilities, and (iv) $330 million in
investment in loans receivable and debt securities. During 2006 and 2005, we
used $19 million and $7 million to fund lease commissions and tenant and
capital improvements, respectively.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.4
billion for 2006 and includes proceeds of $2.4 billion from borrowings under
our term and bridge loans, $1.5 billion from senior note issuances, $1.0
billion from common stock issuances, $366 million of net borrowings under our
bank lines of credit, and $614 million from mortgage debt issuances. These
proceeds were partially offset by or used for the repayment of our term and
partial repayment of bridge loans aggregating $1.9 billion, repayment of $255
million of senior notes, and payment of common and preferred dividends
aggregating $267 million. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our
shareholders. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly
distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock.

At December 31, 2006,
we held approximately $36 million in deposits and $42 million in irrevocable
letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants’ lease obligations and
borrowers’ loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or
depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans.
Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility
operating conditions and other factors, and such changes may be material.

Debt

Bank
lines of credit.

In
connection with the CRP merger, we entered into credit agreements with a
syndicate of banks providing for aggregate borrowings of $3.4 billion. The
facilities included a $0.7 billion bridge loan, a $1.7 billion two-year term
loan, and a $1.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility.

We repaid the bridge loan facility on November 10,
2006. Our bridge loan facility accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to
LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.60% to 1.35%, depending upon our debt
ratings.

At December 31, 2006, borrowings under our term
loan facility were $504.6 million with a weighted average rate of 6.22%. We
repaid all amounts outstanding under the term loan with proceeds from our
capital market transactions completed in January 2007.

At December 31, 2006, borrowings under our $1.0
billion revolving credit facility were $624.5 million with a weighted average
interest rate of 6.05%. Our revolving credit facility matures on October 2,
2009, and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin
ranging from 0.475% to 1.10%, depending upon our non-credit enhanced senior
unsecured long-term debt ratings (“debt ratings”). We pay a facility fee on the
entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.125% to 0.25%, depending upon our
debt ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a negotiated rate option,
which is available for up to 50% of borrowings, whereby the lenders
participating in the credit facility bid on the interest to be charged and
which may result in a reduced interest rate. Based on our debt ratings on December 31,
2006, the margin on the revolving loan facility is 0.70% and the facility fee
is 0.15%.

Our revolving credit agreement contains certain
financial restrictions and other customary requirements. Among other things,
these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement, initially limit (i) Consolidated
Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 70%, (ii) Secured
Debt to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30%, and (iii) beginning January 1,
2007, Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 100%. The
agreement also requires that we maintain (i) a Fixed Charge Coverage
ratio, as defined, of 1.50 times and (ii) a formula-determined Minimum
Tangible Net Worth. These financial covenants become more restrictive over a
period of approximately two years and ultimately (i) limit Consolidated
Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%,


(ii) limit Unsecured
Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, and (iii) require a
Fixed Charge Coverage ratio, as defined, of 1.75 times.

Senior
unsecured notes.

At
December 31, 2006, we had $2.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of
senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from
4.88% to 7.62% with a weighted average rate of 5.88% at December 31, 2006.
Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the
related debt.

On December 4, 2006, we issued $400 million of
5.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes were priced at 99.768% of
the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.69%. We received net proceeds
of $396 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term loan
facility.

On September 19, 2006, we issued $1 billion of
senior unsecured notes, which consisted of $300 million of floating rate
notes due in 2008, $300 million of 5.95% notes due in 2011, and $400 million of
6.30% notes due in 2016. The notes were priced at 100% of the principal amount
for the floating rate notes due in 2008, 99.971% of the principal amount for an
effective yield of 5.957% for the 5.95% notes due in 2011, and 99.877% of the
principal amount for an effective yield of 6.317% for the 6.30% notes due in
2016. We received net proceeds of $994 million, which together with cash on
hand and borrowings under the new facilities were used to repay our then
existing credit facility and to finance the CRP merger.

On February 27, 2006, we issued $150 million of
5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes were priced at 99.071% of
the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.788%. We received net proceeds
of $149 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for
other general corporate purposes.

In February and October 2006, we repaid an
aggregate of $255 million of maturing senior unsecured notes which accrued
interest at a weighted average rate of 7.1%.

The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants
including limitations on debt and other customary terms.

Mortgage
debt.

At
December 31, 2006, we had $2.2 billion in mortgage debt secured by 269
healthcare facilities with a carrying amount of $4.5 billion. Interest rates on
the mortgage notes ranged from 3.72% to 9.32% with a weighted average rate of
6.0% at December 31, 2006.

On December 21, 2006, in anticipation of our
senior housing joint venture that closed on January 5, 2007, we expanded
an existing secured debt facility with Fannie Mae to $686 million, receiving
$446 million in proceeds. The Fannie Mae facility bears interest at a weighted
average rate of 5.66%, with $119 million maturing in October 2013, and
$568 million maturing in November 2016. The funds from the expanded debt
facility were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility.

During 2006, in addition to the mortgage debt issued
under the Fannie Mae facility discussed above, we obtained $165 million of additional
ten-year mortgage financing with a weighted average effective rate of 6.36% in
five separate transactions. We received net proceeds of $162 million, which
were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate
purposes.

The instruments encumbering the properties restrict
title transfer of the respective properties subject to the terms of the
mortgage, prohibit additional liens, restrict prepayment, require payment of
real estate taxes, maintenance of the properties in good condition, maintenance
of insurance on the properties, and include a requirement to obtain lender
consent to enter into material tenant leases.

Other debt.

In
connection with the CRP merger on October 5, 2006, we assumed $104.5
million of non-interest bearing life care bonds at two of our CCRCs and
non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another senior housing facility,
all of which were payable to the related trusts of the facilities (collectively
“Life Care Bonds”). At December 31, 2006, $61.5 million of the Life Care Bonds
were


refundable to the
residents upon the resident moving out or to a resident’s estate upon the
resident’s death, and $46.2 million of the Bonds were refundable after the unit
has been successfully remarketed to a new resident.

Equity

On October 5, 2006,
we issued an aggregate of 27.2 million shares of common stock in connection
with the acquisitions of CRP and CRC.

On November 10, 2006,
we issued 33.5 million shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of
approximately $960 million, which were used to repay our bridge loan facility
and borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities.

At December 31, 2006,
we had 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable
preferred stock, 7.8 million shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative
redeemable preferred stock, and 198.6 million shares of common stock
outstanding.

On January 19, 2007,
we issued 6.8 million shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of
approximately $261 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term
loan and revolving credit facilities.

During the year ended December 31,
2006, we issued approximately 0.8 million shares of our common stock under our
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of
$28.68 for an aggregate amount of $22.9 million. We also received $7.9 million
in proceeds from stock option exercises. At December 31, 2006,
stockholders’ equity totaled $3.3 billion and our equity securities had a
market value of $7.8 billion.

As of December 31,
2006, there were a total of 3.4 million DownREIT units outstanding in six
limited liability companies in which we are the managing member (i) HCPI/Tennessee,
LLC; (ii) HCPI/Utah, LLC; (iii) HCPI/Utah II, LLC; (iv) HCPI/Indiana,
LLC; (v) HCP DR California, LLC; and (vi) HCP DR Alabama, LLC. The
DownREIT units are redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the
then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option,
shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock
splits and reclassifications).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We own interests in
certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP Ventures III, as described
under Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except in limited
circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment carrying amount
and any outstanding loans receivable. We have no other material off-balance
sheet arrangements that we expect to materially affect our liquidity and
capital resources except those described under “Contractual Obligations.”

Inflation

Our leases often provide
for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the
Consumer Price Index or other measures, and/or additional rent based on
increases in the tenants’ operating revenues. Substantially all of our MOB
leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as
real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, etc. We believe that inflationary
increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the tenant expense
reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

At December 31, 2006, we are exposed to market
risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $215 million of variable
rate mortgage notes payable, $0.6 billion of variable rate line of credit, $0.5
billion term loan and $325 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes. Of
the $215 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable outstanding, $45.6
million has been hedged through interest rate swap contracts. We do not have,
and do not plan to enter into, derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. Of our consolidated debt of $6.2 billion at
December 31, 2006, excluding the $45.6 million of variable rate debt where
the rates have been hedged to a fixed rate, approximately 26% is at variable
interest rates, which includes a $0.5 billion term loan that was used to pay
the cash consideration of our merger with CRP. We repaid the remaining balance
of the term loan with proceeds from our January 2007 joint venture and capital
market transactions, which further reduced our variable interest rate exposure.

Fluctuation in the interest rates will not affect our
future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt must be
replaced or refinanced. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair
value of our fixed rate instruments and our hedge contracts. Conversely,
changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future
earnings and cash flows, but not affect the fair value of those instruments.
Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the
variable-rate debt and related swap contracts, and assuming no change in the
outstanding balance as of December 31, 2006, interest expense for 2006
would increase by approximately $17 million, or $0.11 per common share on a
diluted basis.


The
principal amount and the average interest rates for our mortgage loans
receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table
below. The fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on
the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable
loans. The fair market value for our debt securities and senior notes payable
are based on prevailing market prices. The fair market value estimates for
secured loans and mortgage notes payable are based on discounting future cash
flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type
and remaining maturity.

ITEM 9A. Controls
and Procedures

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated
entities. Our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities
are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our
consolidated subsidiaries.

As required by Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2006. Based on the foregoing,


our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There
were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2006 to which this report
relates that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the
framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

On October 5, 2006, CNL Retirement Properties, Inc.
(“CRP”) and CNL Retirement Corp. (“CRC”) merged with and into two of our
subsidiaries. Consistent with published guidance of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, we excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, CRP’s
and CRC’s internal control over financial reporting. Total assets and total
revenues from the CRP and CRC mergers in the aggregate represent 56% and 16%,
respectively, of our related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been
attested to by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.


REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Health Care
Property Investors, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Health Care Property Investors, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Health Care Property Investors, Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of
and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting did not include the internal controls of CNL Retirement Properties, Inc.
and CNL Retirement,Corp. which are included in the 2006 consolidated
financial statements of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and
constituted $5.6 billion and $3.7 billion of total and net assets,
respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and $98.1 million of revenues for
the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of
Health Care Property Investors, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of
the internal control over financial reporting of CNL Retirement Properties, Inc.
and CNL Retirement.Corp.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Health Care
Property Investors, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Health
Care Property Investors, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on the COSO criteria.


We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Health Care Property Investors, Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006 and our report dated February 12, 2007 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

Management
Contract or Compensatory Plan or Arrangement.

For the purposes of complying with the amendments to
the rules governing Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990)
under the Securities Act of 1933, the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes
as follows, which undertaking shall be incorporated by reference into
registrant’s Registration Statement on Form S-8 Nos. 33-28483
and 333-90353 filed May 11, 1989 and November 5, 1999,
respectively, Form S-8 Nos. 333-54786 and 333-54784
each filed February 1, 2001, and Form S-8 No. 333-108838
filed September 16, 2003.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising
under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is therefore,
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
(other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
against public policy expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be
governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Health Care
Property Investors, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006. Our audits also include the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Health Care
Property Investors’ Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)

Business

Health
Care Property Investors, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
that, together with its consolidated entities (collectively, “HCP” or the “Company”),
principally invests directly, or through joint ventures and mortgage loans, in
healthcare-related properties located primarily throughout the United States.

(2)

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

Management is required to
make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of HCP, its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled, through
voting rights or other means, joint ventures. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company adopted Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

,
as revised (“FIN 46R”), effective January 1, 2004 for variable interest
entities created before February 1, 2003 and effective January 1,
2003 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. FIN
46R provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is
achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities”
or “VIEs”) and the determination of which business enterprise is the primary
beneficiary of the VIE. A variable interest entity is broadly defined as an
entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not
have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at
risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional
subordinated financial support. The Company consolidates investments in VIEs
when it is determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE at
either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a
reconsideration event. The adoption of FIN 46R resulted in the consolidation of
five joint ventures with aggregate assets of $18.5 million, effective January 1,
2004, that were previously accounted for under the equity method. The
consolidation of these joint ventures did not have a significant effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

The Company leases 76 properties to a total of 9
tenants that have been identified as VIEs. The Company acquired these leases
(variable interests) on October 5, 2006 in its acquisition of CNL Retirement
Properties, Inc. (“CRP”). CRP determined they were not the primary
beneficiary of the VIEs, and the Company is generally required to carry forward
CRP’s accounting conclusions after the acquisition relative to their primary
beneficiary assessment. The Company may need to reassess whether it is the
primary beneficiary in the future upon the occurrence of a reconsideration
event, as defined by FIN 46R. If the Company determines that it is the primary
beneficiary in the future and consolidates the tenant, its financial statements
would reflect the tenant’s facility level revenues and expenses rather than
lease revenue. The Company’s maximum exposure to losses resulting from the
Company’s involvement in these VIEs is limited to the future minimum lease
payments to be received from these leases, which totaled $1.6 billion as
of December 31, 2006.

F-


HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue 04-5,

Investor’s Accounting for an Investment in a
Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the
Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”), effective June 2005.
The issue concludes as to what rights held by the limited partner(s) preclude
consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would
otherwise consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with GAAP. The
assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of
control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made
when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there
is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited
partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its
ownership of limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase
or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests.

This EITF also applies to managing members in limited
liability companies. The adoption of EITF 04-5 did not have an
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Investments in entities
which the Company does not consolidate but for which the Company has the
ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies
are reported under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting,
the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings or loss is included in the
Company’s operating results.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance
with GAAP, including Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue
Recognition

(“SAB 104”). For leases with minimum scheduled rent
increases, the Company recognizes income on a straight-line basis over the
lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income
on a straight-line basis for leases results in recognized revenue exceeding
amounts contractually due from tenants. Such cumulative excess amounts are
included in other assets and were $35.6 million and $18.4 million, net of
allowances, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the event the
Company determines that collectibility of straight-line rents is not reasonably
assured, the Company limits future recognition to amounts contractually owed,
and, where appropriate, the Company establishes an allowance for estimated
losses. Certain leases provide for additional rents based upon a percentage of
the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds.
Such revenue is deferred until the related thresholds are achieved.

The Company monitors the
liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and borrowers on an ongoing
basis. The evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property
performance, security deposits and guarantees, and other matters. The Company
establishes provisions and maintains an allowance for estimated losses
resulting from the possible inability of its tenants and borrowers to make
payments sufficient to recover recognized assets. For straight-line rent
amounts, the Company’s assessment is based on income recoverable over the term
of the lease. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, the Company had
an allowance of $29.7 million and $21.6 million, included in other assets, as a
result of the Company’s determination that collectibility is not reasonably
assured for certain straight-line rent amounts.

Loans Receivable

Loans receivable are
classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the positive intent and
ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are
stated at amortized cost. The

F-


HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Company
recognizes interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts
and premiums, using the effective interest method.

Real Estate

Real estate, consisting of land, buildings, and
improvements, is recorded at cost. The Company allocates acquisition costs to
the acquired tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities,
primarily lease intangibles, based on their estimated fair values in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141,

Business Combinations

.

The Company assesses fair value based on estimated
cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization
rates, third-party appraisals and available market information. Estimates of
future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical
operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic
conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property
considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.

The Company records acquired “above and below” market
leases at their fair value using a discount rate which reflects the risks
associated with the leases acquired, equal to the difference between (i) the
contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management’s
estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease,
measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market
leases and the initial term plus the term for any below-market fixed rate
renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired
include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company’s
evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. Factors to
be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected
lease-up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In
estimating carrying costs, the Company includes estimates of lost rentals at
market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market
conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company
considers leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.

Developments in process are carried at cost which
includes pre-construction costs essential to development of the property,
construction costs, capitalized interest, and other costs directly related to
the property. Capitalization of interest ceases when the property is ready for
service which generally is near the date that a certificate of occupancy is
obtained. Expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions are
capitalized and amortized over the terms of the respective leases. Repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred.

The Company computes
depreciation on properties using the straight-line method over the assets’
estimated useful lives. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is
identified as held for sale. Building and improvements are depreciated over
useful lives ranging up to 45 years. Above and below market rent intangibles
are amortized primarily to revenue over the remaining noncancellable lease
terms and bargain renewal periods. Other in-place lease intangibles are
amortized to expense over the remaining lease term and bargain renewal periods.
At December 31, 2006 and 2005, lease intangibles assets were $479.6
million and $36.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
lease intangible liabilities were $151.3 million and $5.4 million,
respectively.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the
carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be
recoverable and, with respect to

F-


HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

goodwill,
at least annually applying a fair-value-based test in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. If
the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of the long-lived asset, an impairment loss will be recognized
by adjusting the asset’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value. The
determination of the fair value of long-lived assets, including goodwill,
involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on the Company’s analysis
and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each
long-lived asset. The Company’s ability to accurately predict future operating
results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value.

Net Investment in
Direct Financing Leases

The Company uses the
direct finance method of accounting to record income from direct financing
leases. For leases accounted for as direct financing leases, future minimum
lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the rents
receivable and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is
recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to
income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield. Investments in direct
financing leases are presented net of unamortized unearned income. Direct
financing leases have initial terms that range from 5 to 35 years. Certain
leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the
properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial
investment amount plus adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements.
Certain leases also permit the Company to require the tenants to purchase the
properties at the end of the lease terms.

Assets Held for
Sale and Discontinued Operations

Certain long lived assets are classified as
discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144

, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets

. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported
at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value less cost to sell.
Further, depreciation of these assets ceases at the time the assets are
classified as discontinued operations. Discontinued operations are defined in
SFAS No. 144 as a component of an entity that has either been disposed of
or is deemed to be held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the
component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result
of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant
continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal
transaction.

The Company periodically
sells assets or contributes assets into joint ventures based on market
conditions and the exercise of purchase options by tenants. The operating
results of properties meeting the criteria established in SFAS No. 144 are
reported as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of
income. Discontinued operations in 2006 include 113 properties with revenues of
$54.4 million. The Company had 122 and 154 properties classified as
discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
with revenue of $60.7 million and $69.9 million, respectively. During 2006,
2005, and 2004, 83, 18 and 32 properties were sold, respectively, with net
gains on real estate dispositions of $275.3 million, $10.2 million and $21.1
million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the number of assets
held for sale was 30 and 112 with carrying amounts of $57.5 million and $283.0
million, respectively.

Assets Held for
Contribution

Properties classified as
held for contribution to joint ventures, in which the Company maintains an
ownership interest, qualify as held for sale under SFAS No. 144, but are
not included in discontinued operations due to the Company’s continuing
interest in the ventures. At December 31, 2006, the Company

F-


HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

classified
as held for contribution 25 senior housing assets with an aggregate carrying
value of $1.1 billion. In addition, two properties with an aggregate carrying
value of $25.4 million included in a joint venture formed on October 27,
2006, are classified as held for contribution at December 31, 2005.

Stock-Based
Compensation

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS
No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”), as amended by SFAS No. 148

, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
and Disclosure

(“SFAS No. 148”). The fair value provisions of
SFAS No. 123 were adopted prospectively with the fair value of all new
stock option grants recognized as compensation expense beginning January 1,
2002. Since only new grants are accounted for under the fair value method,
stock-based compensation expense is less than that which would have been
recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards.
Compensation expense for awards with graded vesting is generally recognized
ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no
longer contingent on the employee providing additional services.

SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payments

(“SFAS No. 123R”), which is a revision of
SFAS No. 123

,

was issued in December 2004.
Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to that in SFAS No. 123.
However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income
statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the
modified prospective application transition method which provides for only
current and future period stock-based awards to be measured and recognized at
fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R did not have a significant
impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations since the
fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 were previously adopted.

The
following table reflects net income and earnings per share, adjusted as if the
fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding stock awards in

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
represent short-term investments with original maturities of three months or
less when purchased.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash primarily
consist of amounts held by mortgage lenders to provide for future real estate
tax expenditures and tenant improvements, tenant capital improvement reserves
and security deposits. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, restricted cash
amounts were $38.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, and are included in
other assets.

Derivatives

The Company adopted SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
as amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 148 (“SFAS
No. 133”). SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. It requires the
recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the
Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the
fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that
do not meet the hedge accounting criteria of SFAS No. 133 are recognized
in earnings. For derivatives designated as hedging instruments in qualifying
cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in fair value of the
derivatives is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
whereas the ineffective portions are recognized in earnings.

The Company formally
documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are
designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities in the
balance sheet. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedging
instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that
are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in
cash flows associated with the hedged items. When it is determined that a
derivative ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues
hedge accounting prospectively.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected and believes it operates so as
to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Under the Code, the Company generally is
not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income distributed to
stockholders if certain distribution, income, asset, and shareholder tests are
met. A REIT must distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income to
stockholders. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the tax basis of the Company’s
net assets is less than the reported amounts by $481 million and $298 million,
respectively.

Certain activities the
Company undertakes must be conducted by entities which elect to be treated as
taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). TRSs are subject to both federal and state
income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, income taxes
related to the Company’s TRSs approximated a benefit of $0.7 million and an
expense of $1.5 million, respectively, and are included in general and
administrative expenses. The Company’s income tax expense in 2006 was
insignificant.

Marketable
Securities

The Company classifies its
existing marketable equity and debt securities as available-for-sale in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Investment

, (“SFAS No. 115”).
These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and
losses reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the
specific identification method. During the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005, the Company realized gains totaling $1.9 million and $4.5 million,
respectively, related to the sale of various equity securities. There were no
gains or losses realized in 2004. At December 31, 2006, the carrying value
of debt securities was $322.5 million, which includes $22.5 million in
unrealized gains, and is included in other assets. At December 31, 2006
and 2005, the carrying values of equity securities were $15.2 million and $6.3
million, respectively, and are included in other assets.

Capital Raising
Issuance Costs

Costs incurred in
connection with the issuance of both common and preferred shares are recorded
as a reduction in additional paid-in capital. Costs incurred in connection with
the issuance of debt are deferred in other assets and amortized to interest
expense over the remaining term of the related debt.

Segment Reporting

The Company reports its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

(“SFAS No. 131”). The Company’s segments are based on the Company’s method
of internal reporting which classifies its operations by leasing activities.
The Company’s segments include: medical office buildings (“MOBs”) and
triple-net leased.

Stock Split

As of March 2, 2004,
each stockholder received one additional share of common stock for each share
they own resulting from a 2-for-1 stock split declared by the
Company on January 22, 2004. The stock split has been reflected in all
periods presented.

Minority Interests
and Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments

As of December 31, 2006, there were 3.4 million
non-managing member units outstanding in six limited liability companies of
which the Company is the managing member: HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; HCPI/Utah, LLC;
HCPI/Utah II, LLC; HCPI Indiana, LLC; HCP DR California, LLC and HCP DR Alabama,
LLC. The Company consolidates these entities since it exercises control. The
non-managing member LLC Units (“DownREIT units”) are exchangeable for an amount
of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of the Company’s
common stock or, at the Company’s option, shares of the Company’s common stock
(subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). Upon
exchange of DownREIT units for the Company’s common stock, the carrying amount
of the DownREIT units is reclassified to stockholders’ equity. At December 31,
2006, the market value of the 3.4 million DownREIT units was $219.2 million.

SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

(“SFAS No. 150”)

,

requires, among other things,
that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments

F-


HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

be
classified as a liability and recorded at settlement value. Consolidated joint
ventures with a limited-life are considered mandatorily redeemable.
Implementation of the provisions of SFAS No. 150 that require the
valuation and establishment of a liability for limited-life entities was
subsequently deferred. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has 11
limited-life entities that have a settlement value of the minority interests of
approximately $6.9 million, which is approximately $4.9 million more than the
carrying amount.

Preferred Stock Redemptions

The Company recognizes the
excess of the redemption value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock
redeemed over its carrying amount as a charge to income in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)—EITF Topic D-42,

The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share
for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock

(“EITF Topic D-42”). In July 2003,
the SEC staff issued a clarification of the SEC’s position on the application
of FASB EITF Topic D-42. The SEC staff’s position, as clarified, is that
in applying EITF Topic D-42, the carrying value of preferred shares that
are redeemed should be reduced by the amount of original issuance costs,
regardless of where in stockholders’ equity those costs are reflected (see Note
15).

Life Care Bonds Payable

Two of the Company’s
continuing care retirement communities (“CCRCs”) hold non-interest bearing life
care bonds payable to certain residents of the CCRCs. Generally, the bonds are
refundable to the resident or to the resident’s estate upon termination or
cancellation of the CCRC agreement. One of the Company’s other seniors housing
facilities

requires that certain residents
of the facility post non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits that are
refundable to the resident

or the resident’s estate the earlier of the
re-letting of the unit or after two years of vacancy. Proceeds from the
issuance of new bonds and deposits are used to retire existing bonds. As the
maturity of these obligations is not determinable, no interest is imputed.
These amounts are included in other debt in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes
and Error Corrections

(“SFAS No. 154”), which replaces
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

and SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements

. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the
accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles. It requires
retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in
accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the
period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. This statement
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 154
did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

In April 2006, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position FIN 46R-6,

“Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB
Interpretation No. 46R

” (“FSP FIN 46R-6”). FSP FIN 46R-6
addresses how variability should be considered when applying FIN 46R.
Variability affects the determination of whether an entity is a VIE, which
interests are variable interests, and which party, if any, is the primary
beneficiary of the VIE that is required to be consolidated. FSP FIN 46R-6
clarifies that the design of the entity also should be considered when
identifying which interests are variable interests. FSP FIN 46R-6 must be
applied prospectively to all entities in which the Company first becomes
involved, beginning September 1, 2006. Early application is permitted. The
adoption of FSP FIN 46R-6 did not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

F-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN 48”). This interpretation, among other things, creates a two step
approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs
when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical
merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement
(step two) determines the amount of benefit that more-likely-than-not will be
realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously
recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax
position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained.
FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute
for derecognition of tax positions, and it has expanded disclosure
requirements. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006, in which the impact of adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative
effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. The adoption
of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 is not expected to have a significant impact
on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 1N, “

Financial Statements—Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements

” (“SAB 108”). The SEC staff is providing guidance on how
prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying
misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining
whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated. The
SEC staff indicates that “registrants must quantify the impact of correcting
all misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior
year misstatements, on the current year financial statements.” If correcting a
misstatement in the current year would materially misstate the current year’s
income statement, the SEC staff indicates that the prior year financial
statements should be adjusted. These adjustments to prior year financial
statements are necessary even though such adjustments were appropriately viewed
as immaterial in the prior year. If the Company determines that an adjustment
to prior year financial statements is required upon adoption of SAB 108 and
does not elect to restate its previous financial statements, then it must
recognize the cumulative effect of applying SAB 108 in fiscal 2007 beginning
balances of the affected assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment
to the fiscal 2007 opening balance in retained earnings. The adoption of SAB
108 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies
under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurement. SFAS No. 157 requires prospective application for fiscal
years ending after November 15, 2007. The Company is evaluating SFAS No. 157
and has not yet determined the impact the adoption will have on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

Mergers
with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. and CNL Retirement Corp.

On October 5, 2006, HCP acquired CRP. CRP was a
REIT that invested primarily in senior housing and medical office buildings
located across the United States. This transaction further diversified HCP’s
portfolio by property type, geographic location and operator, and diversified
HCP’s sources of revenues across the healthcare industry. At the time of the
CRP merger, CRP owned or held an ownership interest in 273 properties in 33
states.

Under the merger agreement with CRP, each share of CRP
common stock was exchanged for $11.1293 in cash and 0.0865 of a share of the
HCP’s common stock, equivalent to approximately $2.9 billion in cash, and
22.8 million shares. Fractional shares were paid in cash. The Company financed
the cash consideration paid to CRP stockholders and the expenses related to the
transaction through a $1 billon offering of senior unsecured notes and a draw
down under new term and bridge loan facilities and a new three-year revolving
credit facility.

Simultaneous with the closing of the merger with CRP,
HCP also merged with CNL Retirement Corp. (“CRC”) for aggregate consideration
of approximately $120 million, which included the issuance of 4.4 million
shares of HCP common stock.

Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets
and liabilities of CRP and CRC were recorded at their relative fair values as
of the date of the acquisition, with amounts paid in the excess of the fair
value of the assets acquired recorded as goodwill. HCP obtained preliminary
third-party valuations of the tangible and intangible assets, debt and certain
other assets and liabilities. However, as of December 31, 2006, the
purchase price allocation is preliminary and is pending the receipt of
information necessary to complete the valuation of certain assets and
liabilities. When finalized, adjustments to goodwill may result.

HCP has not identified any material unrecorded
pre-acquisition contingencies where an impairment of the related asset or
determination of the related liability is probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. If information becomes available which would indicate it
is probable that such events had occurred and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated, such items will be included in the final purchase price allocation
and goodwill may be adjusted accordingly.

properties aggregating $544 million, including the following significant
acquisitions:

On November 30, 2006, the Company acquired four
assisted living and independent living facilities for $51 million, through a
sale-leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of ten

approximately 8.0% with annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”).

On May 31, 2006, the Company acquired nine
assisted living and independent living facilities for $99 million, including
assumed debt valued at $61 million, through a sale-leaseback transaction. These
facilities have an initial lease term of ten years, with two ten-year renewal
options. The initial annual lease rate is approximately 8.0% with annual
CPI-based escalators.

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, the
Company acquired 13 medical office buildings (“MOBs”) for $138 million,
including DownREIT units valued at $6 million, in related transactions. The 13
buildings, with 730,000 rentable square feet, have an initial yield of 7.3%.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the
Company sold 83 properties for $512 million and recognized gains of
approximately $275 million, which includes the sale of 69 skilled nursing

Intangibles

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, intangible lease
assets, comprised of lease-up, favorable market lease intangibles, and
intangible assets related to non-compete agreements were $479.6 million and
$36.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
accumulated amortization of intangible assets was $28.7 million and $8.0
million, respectively. The weighted average amortization period of intangible
assets is approximately 21 and 12 years, respectively.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, unfavorable market
lease intangibles, net were $151.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively. At December 31,
2006 and 2005, the accumulated amortization of intangible liabilities was $7.2
million and $2.2 million, respectively. The weighted average amortization
period of unfavorable market lease intangibles is approximately 12 and 6 years,
respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
rental income includes additional revenues of $1.5 million and $2.0
million from the amortization of net unfavorable market lease intangibles,
respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, operating
expense includes additional expense of $0.7 million and $0.1 million from the
amortization of net favorable market lease intangibles, primarily related to
ground leases, respectively. There was no amortization of favorable or
unfavorable market lease intangibles in 2004.

Corporation (“ARC”) (NYSE: ARC) prior to Brookdale’s acquisition of ARC on July 25,
2006, accounted for 9% and 8%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue in 2006
and accounted for 13% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue in 2005.
The carrying amount of the Company’s real estate assets leased to Tenet and
Brookdale was $333 million and $625 million, respectively, at December 31,
2006.

In addition, Sunrise Senior Living (NYSE:SRZ) (“Sunrise”)
accounted for 5% of the Company’s revenue in 2006. The carrying amount of the
Company’s real estate assets operated by Sunrise was $2.2 billion at December 31,
2006. Prior to the Company’s merger with CRP on October 5, 2006, Sunrise
was not an operator of any of the Company’s properties.

Tenet, Brookdale and Sunrise are publicly traded and
are subject to the informational filing requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, each is required to file
periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the

Certain operators of the
Company’s properties are experiencing financial, legal and regulatory

HCP Medical Office
Portfolio, LLC (“HCP MOP”)

HCP MOP was a joint venture formed in June 2003
between the Company and an affiliate of General Electric Company (“GE”). HCP
MOP was engaged in the acquisition, development and operation of MOB
properties. Prior to November 30, 2006, the Company was the managing
member and had a 33% ownership interest therein. On November 30, 2006, the
Company acquired the interest held by GE for $141 million, which resulted in
the consolidation of HCP MOP beginning on that date. The Company is now the
sole owner of the venture and its 59 MOBs, which have approximately four
million rentable square feet.

Prior to November 30, 2006, the Company accounted
for its investment in HCP MOP using the equity method of accounting because it
exercised significant influence through voting rights and its position as
managing member. However, the Company did not consolidate HCP MOP until November 30,
2006, since it did not control, through voting rights or other means, the joint
venture as GE had substantive participating decision making rights and had the
majority of the economic interest. The accounting policies of HCP MOP prior to November 30,
2006, are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting

In August and September 2005, ten medical
office buildings owned by HCP MOP, principally in Louisiana and the surrounding
area, sustained varying degrees of damage due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Four of the buildings incurred substantial damage and are a total loss. For the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the four buildings generated
revenues for HCP MOP of $0.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively. At December 31,
2005, the remaining six buildings had resumed operations with repairs completed
as of June 30, 2006.

As of December 31, 2005, the $3.8 million
carrying value of the four buildings with substantial damage was written off
and an equal amount was recorded as a receivable for the expected insurance
proceeds. Repairs and other related expenditures for damages caused by
hurricanes Katrina and Rita for the eleven-month period ended November 30,
2006, were approximately $2.2 million, and were added to the expected insurance
receivable. For the eleven-month period ended November 30, 2006, HCP MOP
received $6.4 million in proceeds from its insurance carriers, including $1.3
million in excess of insurance receivable. Excess insurance proceeds are
recorded as a gain at the time that the claims are settled with the carrier.

On February 9, 2006, the Company refinanced two
existing loans secured by a hospital in Texas. The loans were combined into a
new single loan that bears interest at 8.5% per annum and matures 2016. The
original maturity of these loans was January 2006 with a weighted average
interest rate of 10.35%.

On December 28, 2005, the Company issued a $40
million loan secured by a hospital in Texas. The note bears interest at 8.75%
per annum. Subject to certain performance conditions, the Company may fund an
additional $10 million under the existing loan agreement.

Through the Company’s merger with CRP, it assumed an
agreement to provide an affiliate of the Cirrus Group, LLC (“Cirrus”) with an
interest only, five-year, senior secured term loan under which up to $85.0
million may be borrowed to finance the acquisition, development, syndication
and operation of new and existing surgical partnerships. Certain of these
surgical partnerships are tenants in the MOBs CRP acquired from Cirrus. During
the first 48 months of the term, which began in August 2005, interest at a
rate of 14.0%, will accrue, of which 9.5% will be payable monthly and the
balance of 4.5% will be deferred. Thereafter, interest at the greater of 14.0%
or LIBOR plus 9.0% will be payable monthly. The loan is subject to equity
contribution requirements and borrower financial covenants that govern the draw
down availability. The loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the
borrower, which are comprised primarily of interest in partnerships operating
surgical facilities in premises leased from a Cirrus affiliate and is
guaranteed up to $50.0 million through a combination of (i) a personal
guarantee of up to $13.0 million by a principal of Cirrus and (ii) a
guarantee of the balance by other principals of Cirrus under arrangements for
recourse limited only to their interests in certain entities owning real estate.
At December 31, 2006, the carrying value of this loan is $66.0 million.

At December 31, 2006, minimum future principal
payments to be received on secured loans receivable are $8.2 million in 2007,
$1.6 million in 2008, $11.1 million in 2009, $12.5 million in 2010, $2.8
million in 2011, and $85.3 million thereafter.

Debt

Bank Lines of
Credit

On October 5, 2006, in connection with the CRP
merger, the Company entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks
providing for aggregate borrowings of $3.4 billion. The facilities included a
$0.7 billion bridge loan, a $1.7 billion two-year term loan, and a $1.0 billion
three-year revolving credit facility.

The Company repaid the bridge loan facility on November 10,
2006. The bridge loan facility accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to
LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.60% to 1.35%, depending upon the Company’s
debt ratings.

At December 31, 2006, borrowings under the term
loan facility were $504.6 million with a weighted average rate of 6.22%. The
Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the term loan, through its capital
market transactions in January 2007.

At December 31, 2006, borrowings under the $1.0
billion revolving credit facility were $624.5 million with a weighted average
interest rate of 6.05%. The revolving credit facility matures on October 2,
2009, and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin
ranging from 0.475% to 1.10%, depending upon the Company’s non-credit enhanced
senior unsecured long-term debt ratings (“debt ratings”). The Company pays a
facility fee on the entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.125% to 0.25%,
depending upon its debt ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a
negotiated rate option, which is available for up to 50% of borrowings, whereby
the lenders participating in the credit facility bid on the interest to be
charged and which may result in a reduced interest rate. Based on the
Company’s debt ratings on December 31, 2006, the margin on the revolving
loan facility is 0.70% and the facility fee is 0.15%.

The revolving credit
agreement contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements.
Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement,
initially limit (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total
Asset Value to 70%, (ii) Secured Debt to Consolidated Total Asset Value to
30% and (iii) beginning January 1, 2007, Unsecured Debt to
Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 100%. The agreement also requires that
the Company maintains (i) a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio, as defined, of
1.50 times and (ii) a formula-determined Minimum Tangible Net Worth. These
financial covenants become more restrictive over a period of approximately two
years and ultimately (i) limit Consolidated Total Indebtedness to
Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit Unsecured Debt to
Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, and (iii) require a Fixed
Charge Coverage ratio, as defined, of 1.75 times. As of December 31, 2006,
the Company was in compliance with each of the restrictions and requirements.

were used to repay its then existing credit facility and to finance the CRP
merger.

On February 27, 2006, the Company issued $150

F-


HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On January 22, 2007, the Company issued $500
million of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes were priced at
99.323% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.09%. The Company
received net proceeds of $493 million, which were used to repay its term loan
facility and borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

The senior unsecured notes
contain certain covenants including limitations on debt and other terms
customary in transactions of this type. As of December 31, 2006, the
Company was in compliance with each of the restrictions and requirements.

Mortgage Debt

At December 31, 2006, the Company had $2.2
billion in mortgage debt secured by 269 healthcare facilities with a carrying
amount of $4.5 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 3.72%
to 9.32%. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the weighted-average interest
rate on mortgage notes payable was 6.0% and 7.05%, respectively.

On December 21, 2006, in anticipation of the
Company’s senior housing joint venture that closed on January 5, 2007, the
Company expanded its existing secured debt facility with Fannie Mae to $686
million, receiving $446 million in proceeds. The Fannie Mae facility, which
encumbers the venture’s 25 assets, bears interest at a weighted average rate of
5.66%, with $119 million maturing in October 2013, and $567 million
maturing in November 2016. The funds from the expanded debt facility were
used to repay borrowings under the Company’s term loan facility. At December 31,
2006, the balance of this facility was $686 million and is classified as
mortgage debt on assets held for contribution.

In addition to the mortgage debt issued under the
Fannie Mae facility discussed above, during 2006, the Company obtained $165
million of ten-year mortgage financing with a weighted average effective rate
of 6.36% in five separate transactions. The Company received net proceeds of
$161.9 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for other
general corporate purposes.

The instruments
encumbering the properties restrict title transfer of the respective properties
subject to the terms of the mortgage, prohibit additional liens, restrict
prepayment, require payment of real estate taxes, maintenance of the properties
in good condition, maintenance of insurance on the properties and include a
requirement to obtain lender consent to enter into material tenant leases.

Other Debt

In connection with the CRP
merger on October 5, 2006, the Company assumed $104.5 million of
non-interest bearing Life Care Bonds at its two CCRCs and non-interest bearing
occupancy fee deposits at another of its senior housing facilities, all of
which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively “Life
Care Bonds”). At December 31, 2006, $61.5 million of the Life Care Bonds  were refundable to the residents upon the
resident moving out or to a resident’s estate upon the resident’s death, and
$46.2 million of the Life Care Bonds  were
refundable after the unit has been successfully remarketed to a new resident.

Commitments
and Contingencies

The Company, from time to time, is party to legal
proceedings, lawsuits and other claims in the ordinary course of the Company’s
business. These claims, even if not meritorious, could force the Company to
spend significant financial resources. Except as described below, the Company
is not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that it believes will have,
individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on its business,
prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

Limited
Partnership Litigation.

On September 26,
2005, the Company filed a lawsuit in Superior Court of California, County of
San Diego entitled Health Care Property
Investors, Inc. v. Fenton Partners, Fenton & Grust, LLC and SRG
Holdco, LP. The Company held an option to acquire certain limited
partnership units in SRG Holdco, LP. The Company settled this lawsuit on November 11,
2005. The settlement included a payment to the Company of $1.7 million. The
Company accounted for the transfer of this financial asset as a sale and
recognized a gain of approximately $1.3 million based on the proceeds received
less the carrying value of the securities. The net gain from the sale of these
securities is included in interest and other income.

State
of California Senate Bill 1953.

One
of the Company’s properties located in Tarzana, California is affected by State
of California Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), which requires certain seismic safety
building standards for acute care hospital facilities. This hospital is
operated by Tenet under a lease expiring in February 2009. The Company and
Tenet are currently reviewing the SB 1953 compliance of this hospital, multiple
plans of action to cause such compliance, the estimated time for completing the
same, and the cost of performing necessary remediation of the property. HCP
cannot currently estimate the remediation costs that will need to be incurred
prior to 2013 in order to make the facility SB 1953-compliant through
2030, and the final allocation of any remediation costs between the Company and
Tenet. Rent on the hospital in 2006 and 2005 was $10.8 million for each year
and the carrying amount was $73.9 million at December 31, 2006.

Master
Trust Liabilities.

Certain
residents of two of the Company’s senior housing facilities have entered into a
master trust agreement with the operator of the facilities whereby amounts paid
upfront by such residents were deposited into a trust account. These funds were
then made available to the senior housing operator in the form of a
non-interest bearing loan to provide permanent financing for the related

F-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

communities. The operator
of the senior housing facility is the borrower under these arrangements;
however, two of the Company’s properties are collateral under the master trust
agreements. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining obligation under the
master trust agreements for these two properties is $10 million. The Company’s
property is released as collateral as the master trust liabilities are
extinguished.

SCCI
Stock Purchase Agreement.

On
July 28, 2005, in connection with the acquisition of SCCI Healthcare
Services Corporation (“SCCI”) by Triumph Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (“Buyer”),
the Company sold its securities in SCCI, with a carrying value of zero, and
received proceeds of $2.9 million. Pursuant to certain indemnities specified in
the related Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), the Company could be required to
return or pay to the Buyer a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of
its shares in certain circumstances. Specifically, the SPA provides that each
seller under the SPA, severally but not jointly, indemnifies Buyer for damages
relating to certain legal proceedings, which are defined in the SPA. The SPA generally
imposes an aggregate cap on the liability of the sellers for indemnities under
the SPA in the amount of $17.5 million, which sum was deposited into escrow at
the closing of the sale as a holdback. The Company accounted for the transfer
of this financial asset as a sale and recognized a gain of approximately $2.8
million based on the proceeds received less the estimated fair value of the
indemnities. The gain from the sale of these securities is included in interest
and other income in the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31,
2005.

Earn-out
Obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of certain
acquisition-related agreements, the Company may be obligated to make additional
payments (“Earn-outs”) upon the achievement of certain criteria. If it is
probable at the time of acquisition of the related properties that the Earn-out
criteria will be achieved, the Earn-out payments are accrued. Otherwise, the
additional purchase consideration is recognized when the performance criteria
are achieved. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company made
Earn-out payments in the aggregate of $6.7 million.

General
Uninsured Losses.

The Company obtains various
types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property, business interruption,
liability, flood, earthquake and terrorism related losses. The Company attempts
to obtain appropriate policy terms, conditions, limits and deductibles
considering the relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and current
industry practice. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses,
such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable
or not economically insurable. Although the Company has obtained coverage to
mitigate the impact of various casualty losses, with policy specifications and
insured limits that it believes are commercially reasonable, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to collect under such policies or that
the policies will provide adequate coverage. Should an uninsured loss occur at
a property, the Company’s assets may become impaired and the Company may not be
able to operate its business at the property for an extended period of time.

In July 2005, the Company entered into three
interest-rate swap contracts that are designated as hedging the variability in
expected cash flows for variable rate debt assumed in connection with the
acquisition of a portfolio of real estate assets in July 2005. The cash
flow hedges have a notional amount of $45.6 million and expire in July 2020.
The fair value of these contracts at December 31, 2006, was
$0.3 million and is included in other liabilities. For the year ended December 31,
2006, the Company recognized increased interest expense of $0.2 million
attributable to the contracts. The Company determined that these swap
agreements were highly effective in offsetting future variable-interest cash
flows related to the assumed mortgages. The effective portion of gains and
losses on these contracts is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) whereas the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings. During
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, there was no ineffective
portion related to these hedges.

In August 2006, the
Company entered into two treasury lock contracts that were designated as
hedging the variability in forecasted interest payments, attributable to
changes in the U.S. Treasury rate, on long-term fixed rate debt forecasted to
be issued between September 1 and October 31, 2006. The cash flow
hedges had a notional principal amount of $560.5 million and were settled on September 16,
2006,

which
was the date that the forecasted debt was issued. The cash settlement value of
these contracts at September 16, 2006, was $4.4 million. The unamortized
amount of these contracts at December 31, 2006, is $4.3 million and is
included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company
determined that these treasury lock agreements were highly effective in
offsetting future variability of forecasted interest payments. Amounts reported
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to these hedges will
be recognized as additional interest expense on the Company’s hedged fixed-rate
debt that will mature in 2011 and 2016. During 2007, the Company estimates that
$0.5 million will be recognized as additional interest expense.

Impairments

During 2006, 30 properties were deemed impaired
resulting in impairment charges of $9.6 million. Impairment charges principally
arose as a result of the disposition of four properties, the contribution of 25 properties
into a senior housing joint venture in January 2007, and a decrease in
expected cash flows from one property. During 2005, no properties were determined
to be impaired. During 2004, 16 properties were deemed impaired resulting
in impairment charges of $17.1 million. During 2004, impairment charges
principally arose as a result of reduced anticipated holding periods and
planned near-term dispositions. Impairment charges are summarized as follows:

Earnings
Per Common Share

The Company computes earnings per share in accordance
with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per Share

.
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable
to common shares by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated
including the effect of dilutive securities. Approximately 0.9 million and
1.0 million options to purchase shares of common stock that had an
exercise price in excess of the average market price of the common stock during
2005 and 2004 were not included because they are not dilutive. Additionally,
6.0 million shares issuable upon conversion of 3.4 million non-managing member
units in 2006 and 2005, and 5.1 million shares issuable upon conversion of 2.5
million non-managing member units in 2004 were not included since they are
anti-dilutive.

About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables,

because of the short maturities of these instruments. Fair values for secured
loans receivable, senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt are estimates based
on rates currently prevailing for similar instruments of similar maturities.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps were determined through estimates

of grant. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock
options granted was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of
employees and expected turnover rates. Expected volatility was based on
historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option’s expected life,
ending on the day of grant, and calculated on a weekly basis.

Restricted Stock
and Performance Restricted Stock Units

Under the 2006 Incentive Plan, restricted stock and
performance restricted stock units generally vest over a three- to five-year
period. The vesting of certain restricted shares and units may accelerate upon
retirement, a change in control of the Company, as defined, and other events.
When vested, each performance restricted stock unit is convertible into one
share of common stock. The restricted stock and performance restricted stock
units are valued on the grant date based on the market price of a common share
on that date. Generally, the Company recognizes the fair value of the awards
over the applicable vesting period as compensation expense.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $25.5 million
of total unrecognized compensation cost, related to unvested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under the Company’s incentive plans, which is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years.

On August 14, 2006,
the Company granted to the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
219,000 restricted stock units. The restricted stock units vest over a period
of ten years beginning in 2012. Additionally, as the Company pays dividends on
its outstanding common stock, the original award will be credited with
additional restricted stock units as dividend equivalents (as opposed to
receiving a cash payment). The dividend equivalent restricted stock units will
be subject to the same vesting and other conditions as applied to the grant
generally.

Segment
Disclosures

The Company’s business consists of financing and
leasing healthcare-related real estate. The Company evaluates its business and
makes resource allocations on its two business segments—triple-net leased and
medical office building segments. Under the triple-net leased segment, the
Company invests in healthcare-related real estate through acquisition and
secured financing of primarily single tenant properties. Properties acquired
are primarily leased under triple-net leases. Under the medical office building
segment, the Company invests in medical office buildings that are primarily
leased under gross or modified gross leases, generally to multiple tenants, and
generally require a greater level of property management. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies (see Note 2). There are no intersegment
sales or transfers. The Company evaluates performance based upon property net
operating income of the combined properties in each segment.

Non-segment revenue consists mainly of interest on
unsecured loans and other income. Non-segment assets consist of corporate
assets including cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, net and deferred
financing costs. Interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and other
non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual
segments in determining the Company’s performance measure.

Net Operating Income
from Continuing Operations (“NOI”) is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure
used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties. The
Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property
level operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general
and administrative expenses, impairments, interest expense and discontinued
operations. The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful
information because it measures the operating performance of the Company’s real
estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis. The Company uses NOI to
make decisions about resource allocations and assess property level
performance. The Company believes that net income is the most directly
comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative
measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does
not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, NOI may not be comparable
to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different
methodologies for calculating NOI.
