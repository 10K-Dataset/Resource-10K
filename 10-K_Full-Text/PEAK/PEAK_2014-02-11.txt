ITEM 1.    Business

Business Overview

HCP, an S&P 500 company, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. We are a
Maryland corporation organized in 1985 to qualify as a self-administered real estate investment trust ("REIT"). We are headquartered in Long Beach, California, with offices in Nashville, Tennessee and
San Francisco, California. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate, and provide financing to healthcare providers. Our portfolio is comprised of investments in the
following five healthcare segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital. We make
investments in our healthcare segments using the following five investment products: (i) properties under lease, (ii) debt investments, (iii) developments and redevelopments,
(iv) investment management and (v) investments in senior housing operations utilizing the structure permitted by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which is commonly referred
to as "RIDEA."

The
delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that
the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following:

•

Compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services;

•

Specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and

•

Ongoing consolidation of a fragmented healthcare real estate sector.

Our
website address is

www.hcpi.com

. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on
Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") are available on our
website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish them to, the United States ("U.S.") Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Healthcare Industry

Healthcare is the single largest industry in the U.S. based on Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). According to the National Health
Expenditures report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"): (i) national health expenditures are projected to grow 6.1% in 2014 and 5.8% in 2015; (ii) the average
compounded annual growth rate for national health expenditures, over the projection period of 2015 through 2022, is anticipated to be 6.2%; and (iii) the healthcare industry is projected to
represent 18.3% of U.S. GDP in 2014.

Senior
citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services. According to CMS, on a per capita basis, the 75-year and older segment of the population spends 76% more on healthcare
than the 65 to 74-year-old segment and over 200% more than the population average.

Business Strategy

Our primary goal is to increase stockholder value through profitable growth, which allows us to maintain or increase dividends per
share to our stockholders. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification and
(iii) conservative financing.

Opportunistic Investing

We make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create stockholder value. We position ourselves to create
and take advantage of opportunities that will allow us to meet our goals and investment criteria.

Portfolio Diversification

We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment, geography, operator, tenant and investment
product. We monitor, but do not limit, our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, investment product or geographic location, the number
of properties that may be leased to a single operator or tenant, or loans that may be made to a single borrower. With investments in multiple segments and investment products, we can focus on
opportunities with the most attractive risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole. We may structure transactions as master leases, require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications,
obtain credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk.



Conservative Financing

We believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach. We maintain a
conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt-to-equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit facility (the "Facility"), access to
capital markets and secured debt lenders, relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners, and our ability to divest of assets. Our debt obligations are primarily fixed
rate with staggered maturities, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations.

We
finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize the Facility or arrange for other short-term borrowings from
banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing by offering equity and debt securities, placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders.

We
specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in Item 7, "2013 Transaction Overview," of this report.

Competition

Investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment
companies, pension funds, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources
and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete
may also be impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations,
new legislation and population trends.

Income
from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels, including: the quality of care
provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price and range of services offered, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral
sources, location, the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas, and the financial condition of our tenants and operators. Private, federal and state payment programs, as well as
the effect of laws and regulations, may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators. For a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions
affecting our business, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

Healthcare Segments

Senior housing.

At December 31, 2013, we had interests in 444 senior housing facilities, 20 of which are in a RIDEA structure.
Excluding RIDEA
properties, all of our senior housing facilities are triple-net leased to single tenants. Senior housing facilities include assisted living facilities ("ALFs"), independent living facilities ("ILFs")
and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"), which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs. Services provided by our operators or tenants in
these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Our senior
housing property types are further described below:

•

Assisted Living Facilities.

ALFs are licensed care
facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living ("ADL"), such as bathing, eating and dressing, yet require
limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop



access,
hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private
residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of Alzheimer's disease or other
forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. At December 31, 2013, we had interests in 366 ALFs.

•

Independent Living Facilities.

ILFs are designed to meet
the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need assistance with ADL.
However, in some of our facilities, residents have the option to contract for these services. At December 31, 2013, we had interests in 64 ILFs.

•

Continuing Care Retirement Communities.

CCRCs provide
housing and health-related services under long-term contracts. This alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change, thus allowing
residents to "age in place." Some CCRCs require a substantial entry or buy-in fee, and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services. CCRCs
typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry. At December 31, 2013, we had interests in 14 CCRCs.

Our
senior housing segment accounted for approximately 36%, 33% and 30% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following table
provides information about our senior housing operator concentration for the year ended December 31, 2013:

Sunrise Senior Living Inc. ("Sunrise")

(2)



Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. ("Brookdale")



(1)

Percentage
of total revenues includes revenues earned from both senior housing and post-acute/skilled nursing facilities leased to HCR ManorCare.

(2)

These
concentrations include properties that are leased to tenants who have entered into management contracts with Sunrise to operate the respective
property on their behalf.

Post-acute/skilled nursing.

At December 31, 2013, we had interests in 302 post-acute/skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"). SNFs
offer
restorative, rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and complex treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenues from sub-acute care
services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain
injury care and orthopedic therapy, as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain SNFs provide some of the foregoing services on an out-patient basis. Post-acute/skilled
nursing services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by private sources or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. All of our SNFs are triple-net
leased to single tenants.

Our
post-acute/skilled nursing segment accounted for approximately 29% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. During the year ended
December 31, 2013, HCR ManorCare, as our tenant/operator, contributed 83% of our post-acute/skilled nursing segment revenues.



Life science.

At December 31, 2013, we had interests in 115 life science properties, including four facilities owned by our
Investment
Management Platform. These properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies, scientific research institutions, government
agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry. While these properties contain similar characteristics to commercial office buildings, they generally contain more advanced
electrical, mechanical, and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ("HVAC") systems. The facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops
and related amenities. In many instances, life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space, in addition to landlord improvements, to accommodate biology, chemistry or
medical device research initiatives. Life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings. The business park and campus settings allow us
the opportunity to provide flexible, contiguous/adjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants. Our properties are located in well-established geographical markets known for
scientific research, including San Francisco, San Diego and Salt Lake City. At December 31, 2013, 96% of our life science properties were triple-net leased (based on leased square feet).

Our
life science segment accounted for approximately 14%, 15% and 17% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following table
provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended December 31, 2013:

Medical office.

At December 31, 2013, we had interests in 272 medical office buildings ("MOBs"), including 66 facilities owned by
our
Investment Management Platform. These facilities typically contain physicians' offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services
such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings, they require additional plumbing, electrical and
mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room, and special equipment such as x-ray machines. In addition, MOBs are often built to accommodate higher
structural loads for certain equipment and may contain "vaults" or other specialized construction. Our MOBs are typically multi-tenant properties leased to healthcare providers (hospitals and
physician practices), with approximately 77% of our MOBs, based on square feet, located on hospital campuses and 94% are affiliated with hospital systems. At December 31, 2013, 47% of our
medical office buildings were triple-net leased (based on leased square feet).

Our
medical office segment accounted for approximately 17%, 18% and 19% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During the year ended
December 31, 2013, HCA, Inc. ("HCA"), as our tenant, contributed 14% of our medical office segment revenues.

Hospital.

At December 31, 2013, we had interests in 20 hospitals, including four facilities owned by our Investment Management
Platform.
Services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance and Health Maintenance Organizations or "HMOs"), or
through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our hospital property types include acute care, long-term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals. Our hospitals are generally leased to single
tenants or operators under triple-net lease structures.



Our
hospital segment accounted for approximately 4%, 5% and 5% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following table provides
information about our hospital tenant/operator concentration for the year ended December 31, 2013:

Investment Products

Properties under lease.

We primarily generate revenue from properties under long-term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income
from leases
are received under triple-net leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees,
utilities and insurance. However, some of our MOB and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such gross or modified gross leases, we incur
the property operating expenses.

Our
ability to grow income from leased properties depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income by increasing rental rates and occupancy
levels, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries and (iii) control non-recoverable operating expenses. Most of our leases include contractual annual base rent escalation clauses that are either
predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index, which may include minimum and/or maximum percentage increases.

Debt investments.

Our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities, which directly
or indirectly
own properties, and are subordinate to other debt, including mortgages and other mezzanine loans. Our mortgage and construction loans are typically made to healthcare providers, and healthcare real
estate generally secures these loans.

Developments and redevelopments.

We generally commit to development projects that are at least 50% pre-leased or when we believe that
market
conditions will support speculative construction. We work closely with our local real estate service providers, including brokerage, property management, project management and construction management
companies to assist us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments. Our development and redevelopment investments are primarily in our life science and medical office segments.
Redevelopments are properties that require significant capital expenditures (generally more than 25% of acquisition cost or existing basis) to renovate, achieve stabilization or to change the primary
use of the property.

Investment management.

We co-invest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as
partnerships or
limited liability companies. We target institutional investors with long-term investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate. Predominantly, we retain
noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20% to 30% and serve as the managing member. These ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees, and have the
potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture.

Our
Investment Management Platform represents the following unconsolidated joint ventures: (i) HCP Ventures III, LLC, and HCP Ventures IV, LLC, which consists of MOB
portfolios, and (ii) the HCP Life Science ventures. For a more detailed description of these unconsolidated joint ventures, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Operating properties ("RIDEA").

We may enter into contracts with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a
structure permitted
by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as "RIDEA"). Under the provisions of RIDEA, a REIT may lease "qualified healthcare properties" on an arm's length basis to a
taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor." We view RIDEA as a structure primarily to be
used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points and to drive growth by: (i) transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale, operating efficiencies, and/or
ancillary services; or (ii) investing capital to reposition the asset.

Portfolio Summary

At December 31, 2013, we managed $21.7 billion of investments in our Owned Portfolio and Investment Management Platform.
At December 31, 2013, we also owned $517 million of assets under development, redevelopment, and land held for future development.

Employees of HCP

At December 31, 2013, we had 154 full-time employees, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement

Overview

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations
relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare
industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. These
regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with
this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies
and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a
significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

Based
on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators, excluding our medical office segment, at December 31, 2013 we estimate that approximately 17% and 14% of the
annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, respectively.

The
following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers' relationships and
arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from
filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and



fee-splitting
statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or
services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the "Stark Law"), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician
or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent
claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive
sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are
enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants
to bring

qui tam

or "whistleblower" actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws, and may become the subject of governmental
enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws.

Reimbursement

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among others, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal
Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance carriers and HMOs. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the
federal government and many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for
certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators.

Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need

Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and
inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states
require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process
related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants' and operators' abilities to expand or change their businesses.

Life Science Facilities

While certain of our life science tenants include some well-established companies, other such tenants are less established and, in some
cases, may not yet have a product approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or other regulatory authorities, for commercial sale. Creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires
substantial investments of time and money, in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry; it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is
safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance.

Senior Housing Entrance Fee Communities

Certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance fee is an upfront fee or
consideration paid by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form of long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory
oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility's financial condition, establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to
cancel their contracts within a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters.



Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA")

Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are "public
accommodations" as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily
achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by
persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance
with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an ongoing one, and we
continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.

Environmental Matters

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare
facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender.
Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender,
such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating
to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property
damages and the owner's or secured lender's liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such
substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral
which, in turn, could reduce our earnings. For a description of the risks associated with environmental matters, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

The section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

As
set forth below, we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories:

•

Risks related to our business; and

•

Risks related to tax matters, including REIT-related risks.

Risks Related to Our Business

Volatility, disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real
estate and development activities.

The global financial markets have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions. While these conditions have stabilized since the
first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets continue to show signs of improvement, the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain. Additional levels of market disruption,
volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development
activities.



Market
volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures, which may result in a substantial decrease in the value
of our properties and those of our joint ventures. As a result, we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill, if any, which may require us to
recognize impairment charges in earnings.

We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to
meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business.

We may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations. If we are unable to obtain enough internal
capital, we may need to rely on external sources of capital (including debt and equity financing) to fulfill our capital requirements. If we cannot access these external sources of capital, we may not
be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital
depends upon a number of factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including but not limited to:

•

general availability of credit and market conditions, including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost;

•

the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities;

•

the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions;

•

our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility;

•

the financial integrity of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their
willingness to make additional loans to us, and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms, or at all;

•

the stability of the market value of our properties;

•

the financial performance and general market perception of our operators, tenants and borrowers;

•

changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the United States of
its obligations; and

•

issues facing the healthcare industry, including, but not limited to, healthcare reform and changes in government
reimbursement policies.

If
our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations, refinance our debt obligations, fund
dividend payments, acquire properties and development activities.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and negatively impact the market
price of our securities, including our common stock.

The credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall
financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the
terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate, we would
likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain



additional
financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our
current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.

Our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations.

Our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2013 was approximately $8.7 billion. We may incur additional indebtedness
in the future, including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets, which may be substantial. Any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of
our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our
cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, conduct development activities, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy.
Increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive
disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels. Increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance or
refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed.

Covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future,
require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage and leverage ratio, tangible net worth
requirements and maintaining REIT status. Our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants, which
limit our operational flexibility. For example, mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability, without the consent of the lender, to further
encumber or sell the applicable properties, or to replace the applicable tenant or operator. Breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and
cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness, even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee. Additionally, defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to
mortgaged properties, including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator, may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and cross-defaults under certain of
our other indebtedness. Covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

An increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt, and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets and limit
our acquisition, investment and development activities.

If interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt. This increased cost could make the financing of any
acquisition and development activity more costly. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing
and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our
ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We
manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swap
agreements. However, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Swap agreements involve risk, including that counterparties may fail
to honor their



obligations
under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be
limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case. Failure to hedge
effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the denominated currency. The
ownership of investments located outside of the United States subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value
of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, debt covenant ratios, results of operations and
cash flow.

We
may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods. For example, we have a
£137 million GBP investment ($227 million at December 31, 2013) and maintain a £137 million unsecured GBP term loan as a natural hedge.
Additionally, we executed a currency swap contract to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on this investment. However, no amount of hedging activity can fully
insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk, if we choose to engage in such
activities, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 50% of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial
arrangements with the following four companies: HCR ManorCare (28%); Emeritus (13%); Sunrise (5%); and Brookdale (4%). The failure, inability or unwillingness of these operators or tenants to meet
their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations, which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay, cause our stock price to decline and have
other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In
addition, any failure by these operators or tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation
and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These
operators and tenants generally have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective
businesses, and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations.

Economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 41% of our revenue was derived from properties located in California (21%),
Texas (11%) and Florida (9%). As a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local



economies
or changes in local real estate conditions, increased competition or decreased demand, and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

We lease our properties directly to operators in most cases, and in certain other cases, we lease to third-party tenants who enter into
long-term management agreements with operators to manage the properties. Although our leases, financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right
under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict an operator or tenant, or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to
a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies. For example, we cannot
evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing. A debtor has the right to assume, or to assume and assign to a third party, or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy
proceeding. If a debtor were to reject its leases with us, our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which
may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. In addition, the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations
may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities, credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators. In addition,
under certain conditions, defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross-default under our other indebtedness. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the
applicable agreements in those circumstances, the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, delays in the
availability of funding or other material adverse consequences. In addition, many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide long-term custodial care to the elderly; evicting
such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful.

Our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses.

Our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that
covers us, as well as the tenants and operators. Certain losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we
could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless
remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage
provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to require the same level of insurance coverage of our
tenants and operators, or that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future. Also, we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance
proceeds, will not occur in the future.

Our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs.

In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought
litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities. Also, in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect
of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In



addition,
their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or even not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation
environment continues. Cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance,
potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs. In addition, as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits
allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants, for which claims such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against, but which may
require unanticipated expenditures on our part.

Operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, may cease to operate or
be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

Certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal, state and local laws and regulations that are
subject to frequent and substantial changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing
law. See "Item 1—Business—Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement" above. For example, to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant
portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to:

•

statutory and regulatory changes;

•

retroactive rate adjustments;

•

recovery of program overpayments or set-offs;

•

administrative rulings;

•

policy interpretations;

•

payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers;

•

government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities); and

•

interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property.

In
recent years, governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures. Healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of
significant importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators' and
tenants' costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. The failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws, requirements
and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us.

Legislation to address federal government operations and Administration decisions affecting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could have a material adverse
effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

Enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 and Congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt
ceiling, the Affordable Care Act, tax reform, and entitlement programs, including reimbursement rates for physicians, could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial
condition or results of operations. In particular, funding for entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for programs such as



Medicare
Advantage Plans and reductions in reimbursements to providers; Congressional action related to the federal debt ceiling may have an impact on credit markets; tax reform may impact corporate
and individual tax rates as well as impact retirement plans. Additionally, amendments to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, along with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of
2010 (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act"), implementation of the Affordable Care Act by the Administration, and decisions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could impact the
delivery of services and benefits under Medicare, Medicaid or Medicare Advantage Plans. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of
operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us.

Operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to
meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

Certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and
inspection laws, regulations and standards. Our operators' or tenants' failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of
reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or closure of the facility and/or the incurrence of considerable costs
arising from an investigation or regulatory action. For example, certain of our properties may require a license, registration and/or certificate of need to operate. Failure of any operator or tenant
to obtain a license, registration or certificate of need, or loss of a required license, registration or certificate of need, would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such
operator or tenant. Additionally, failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us,
and therefore may materially adversely impact us. See
"Item 1—Business—Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement—Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need" above.

Increased competition, as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast, has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our operators
and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

The healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future. The occupancy levels at, and rental income
from, our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital
resources. These entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels, including the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price,
the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics
of the population in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the
properties and their tenants. Our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at
home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. Such competition, which is due, in part, to historical over-development in some segments in which we invest,
has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease.
We cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Further,
many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants. Thus, our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future
that could



limit
their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us,
potentially decreasing our revenues, impairing our assets, and increasing our collection and dispute costs.

Our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty.

Life science tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique
risks, as follows:

•

some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research, development and clinical testing of their
products and technologies. If private investors, the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities, a tenant's business may be adversely affected or fail;

•

the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal,
state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain;

•

even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, the product may still present
significant regulatory and liability risks, including, among others, the possible later discovery of safety concerns, competition from new products, and ultimately the expiration of patent protection
for the product;

•

our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of
government or private healthcare payors; and

•

our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws.

We
cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses. If our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to
us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be
unable to successfully operate, occupy or reposition the underlying real estate, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.

If an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our
interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property's investment potential. In some cases, as noted above, the
collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and, accordingly, we may not have full
recourse to assets of that entity. Operators, tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other
remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. Foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the facility
may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure, and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. Even if we are able to
successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators, if at all, or equity
interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws, either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment.



Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities.

Transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications,
including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of
commercial operations and other types of real estate. The replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal, state or local government agency
necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. If we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms,
or at all, we may take possession of a facility, which might expose us to successor liability, require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses,
or spend substantial time and funds to adapt the facility to other uses, all of which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase, or develop, suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio.

We face significant competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds,
healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more
challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our
investment, acquisition and development activities. If we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline, identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if
we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

We may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants.

Healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. The improvements
generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, are costly and at times tenant-specific. A new or replacement operator or
tenant may require different features in a property, depending on that operator's or tenant's particular business. If a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and/or vacates a property, we
may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant. Also, if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or
tenants, we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to re-lease the space. These expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

We face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and, under certain circumstances, prevent
completion of development activities once undertaken.

Large-scale, ground-up development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us, including risks
that:

•

a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or
failure to recover expenses already incurred;

•

the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and
higher materials, transportation, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make the completion of the development project less profitable;



•

construction and/or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;

•

the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including
natural disasters, labor conditions, material shortages, regulatory hurdles, civil unrest and acts of war, which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide
tenants or operators with the right to terminate pre-construction leases; and

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the
property profitable.

These
risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.

We have and may continue in the future to develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when
circumstances warrant the use of these
structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including:

•

we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could
require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes, including litigation or arbitration;

•

our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including
the timing, terms and strategies for any investments;

•

our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted;

•

our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to
fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and

•

our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.

From time to time, we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations, our business, results of operations and financial condition
may be materially adversely affected.

Acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. Successful integration of the operations
of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may encounter difficulties in
these integrations. Potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business
or that of the acquired entity, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities,
including:

•

liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;

•

unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller;

•

liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior
to our acquisition;

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the seller; and



•

liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.

In
addition, the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected, including in respect of estimated cost savings. Inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental
or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues. Similarly, we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards
established for their intended use. If we have difficulties with any of these areas, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies,
we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions, and this may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions, which may involve the expenditure of significant funds.

We regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value and believe that currently there are available a
number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business, given the recent industry consolidation trend. In connection with our review of such transactions, we regularly engage
in discussions with potential acquisition candidates, some of which are material. Any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities, the incurrence of debt, assumption of contingent
liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures, any of which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the financing required
for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all.

Loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us.

We are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers, and competition for these individuals is intense. Although our chief
executive officer, chief financial officer, chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us, we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us. The loss or
limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock.

Unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits
allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various
claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, litigation. In addition, litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or
interruption of our normal business operations.

We may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future
revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense.

We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are
adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such



coverage,
and we continually review the insurance maintained by us. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake, windstorm, flood and other natural disasters
and may be subject to other losses. In particular, our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity. While we purchase insurance for earthquake,
windstorm, flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants, there is no assurance that such insurance
will fully cover such losses. These losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property. Following
these events, we may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. The insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to
purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future. In addition, there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is
economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments.

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or previous owner of real estate, we may be
required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage
and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the
government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Although we (i) currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to
deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable, and (ii) generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, such
liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance, the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property. The presence of contamination or the
failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. As the owner of a site, we
may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. Although we are generally indemnified by the current operators or
tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. We may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions
not known to us.

The impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted.

Legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes
in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. Notably, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act. The passage of the Affordable Care Act has resulted
in comprehensive reform legislation that is expanding healthcare coverage to millions of currently uninsured people beginning in 2014 and that provides for significant changes to the U.S. healthcare
system over the next ten years. To help fund this expansion, the Affordable Care Act outlines certain reductions in Medicare reimbursements for various healthcare providers, including long-term acute
care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, as well as certain other changes to Medicare payment methodologies. This comprehensive healthcare legislation provides for extensive future rulemaking by
regulatory authorities, and also may be altered or amended. We cannot accurately predict whether any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, these proposals
would have on our operators and tenants and, thus, our business. Similarly, while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities



will
affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal healthcare programs, we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our
operators and tenants and thus on our business.

The
Supreme Court's decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state Medicaid programs with a
federally mandated expansion of those programs has not reduced the uncertain impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade. We can expect that the federal
authorities will continue to implement the law, but, because of the Supreme Court's mixed ruling, the implementation will take longer than originally expected, with a commensurate increase in the
period of uncertainty regarding the law's full long-term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare.

We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information,
and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, and tenant and lease data. We purchase some of our information
technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of
confidential tenant and other customer information, such as individually identifiable information, including information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the
security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning or
damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer
viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and
availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to certain provisions of Maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations.

The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations,
including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an "interested stockholder"
or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria
are met. An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a Maryland corporation.
Unless our Board of Directors takes action to exempt us, generally or with respect to certain transactions, from this statute in the future, the Maryland Business Combination Act will be applicable to
business combinations between us and other persons.

In
addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the Maryland Business Combination Act, our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations. Our charter
requires that, except in certain circumstances, "business combinations," including a merger or consolidation, and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities, with a "related person,"
including a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock, be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding voting stock.



The
restrictions on business combinations provided under Maryland law and contained in our charter may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such
transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests.

Risk Related to Tax, including REIT-Related risks

Loss of our tax status as a REIT would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely
within our control. We intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a REIT. However, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet, through actual
annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Code. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at
least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,
excluding net capital gains. In addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding
qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we have
operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

If
we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we
issue and to make distributions to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we will be subject to corporate-level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income
at regular corporate rates;

•

we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for
the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a REIT.

As
a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value
of our common stock.

We could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit, delay or impede future sales of our properties.

If, during the ten-year period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies, we recognize gain on the disposition of any property
acquired, then, to the extent of the excess of (i) the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over (ii) our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that
date, we will be required to pay a corporate-level federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate. There can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur,
and these requirements could limit, delay or impede future sales of our properties.



In
addition, the IRS may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies, in which case we will owe these
taxes plus interest and penalties, if any.

There are uncertainties relating to the calculation of non-REIT tax earnings and profits ("E&P") in certain acquisitions, which may require us to distribute E&P.

In order to remain qualified as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated non-REIT E&P of
certain companies that we acquire, prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. Failure to make such E&P distributions would result in our disqualification as a REIT.
The determination of the amount to be distributed in such E&P distributions is a complex factual and legal determination. We may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our
analysis, or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the IRS. We currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such E&P distributions. There are, however,
substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of E&P, including the possibility that the IRS could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased,
which would increase our non-REIT E&P. Moreover, an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated non-REIT E&P, which could require us to pay an
additional taxable distribution to our then-existing stockholders, if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default, or could result in our disqualification as a REIT.

Thus,
we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our non-REIT E&P by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. Moreover, although there
are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our E&P, we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so.

Our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock.

Our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us
in preserving our qualification as a REIT. Under our charter, subject to certain exceptions, no person or entity may own, actually or constructively, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock.

Additionally,
our charter has a 9.9% ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares, which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock. Our
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit. The ownership limits may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that
might involve a
premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

ITEM 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 2.    Properties

We are organized to invest in income-producing healthcare-related facilities. In evaluating potential investments, we consider a
multitude of factors, including:

•

Location, construction quality, age, condition and design of the property;

•

Geographic area, proximity to other healthcare facilities, type of property and demographic profile;

•

Whether the expected risk-adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital;



•

Whether the rent or operating income provides a competitive market return to our investors;

•

Duration, rental rates, operator and tenant quality and other attributes of in-place leases, including master lease
structures;

•

Current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet our operational needs;

•

Availability of security such as letters of credit, security deposits and guarantees;

•

Potential for capital appreciation;

•

Expertise and reputation of the operator or tenant;

•

Occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities;

•

The mix of revenues generated at healthcare facilities between privately-paid and government reimbursed;

•

Availability of qualified operators or property managers and whether we can manage the property;

•

Potential alternative uses of the facilities;

•

The regulatory and reimbursement environment in which the properties operate;

•

Tax laws related to REITs;

•

Prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing; and

•

Our access to and cost of capital.



The following summarizes our property and direct financing lease ("DFL") investments as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 (square
feet and dollars in thousands).

Senior
housing includes average units of 4,620, 4,626 and 1,545 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, that are in a
RIDEA structure in which resident occupancy impacts our annual revenue. The average resident occupancy for these units was 88%, 86% and 86% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. All other senior housing, post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital facilities are generally triple-net leased to single tenants, which were substantially 100% leased.

(2)

Average
annual rent is presented as a ratio of revenues comprised of rental and related revenues, tenant recoveries and income from direct financing leases
divided by the average capacity or average occupied square feet of the facilities and annualized for mergers and acquisitions for the year in which they occurred. Average annual rent for leased
properties (including DFLs) excludes termination fees and non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles and DFL interest
accretion). Average annual rent for properties operated under a RIDEA structure is calculated based on NOI divided by the average capacity of the facilities.

(3)

Capacity
for senior housing facilities is measured in available units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom units). Capacity for post-acute/skilled
nursing and hospitals is measured in available bed count. Capacity for life science facilities and MOBs is measured in square feet. Average capacity for senior housing, post-acute/skilled nursing and
hospitals is as reported by the respective tenants or operators for the twelve month period and one quarter in arrears from the periods presented.

ITEM 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical factual statements are "forward-looking statements." We
intend to have our forward-looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include this statement for purposes of complying with
those provisions. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers' intent, belief or expectations as
identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "project," "expect," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "seek," "forecast," "plan," "estimate," "could," "would," "should" and other comparable
and derivative terms or the negatives thereof. In addition, we, through our officers, from time to time, make forward-looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future
operations, strategies, securities offerings, growth and investment opportunities, dispositions, capital structure changes, budgets and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while
forward-looking statements reflect our good faith belief and reasonable assumptions based upon current information, we can give no assurance that our expectations or forecasts will be attained.
Therefore, readers should be mindful that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult
to predict. As more fully set forth in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors" in this report, factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations contained in
the forward-looking statements include:

(a)

Changes
in global, national and local economic conditions, including a prolonged period of weak economic growth;

(b)

Volatility
or uncertainty in the capital markets, including changes in the availability and cost of capital (impacted by changes in interest rates and the
value of our common stock); which may adversely impact our ability to consummate transactions or reduce the earnings from potential transactions;

(c)

Our
ability to manage our indebtedness level and changes in the terms of such indebtedness;

(d)

The
effect on healthcare providers of recently enacted and pending Congressional legislation addressing entitlement programs and related services, including
Medicare and Medicaid, which may, result in future reductions in reimbursements;

(e)

The
ability of our operators, tenants and borrowers to conduct their respective businesses in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase their revenues and
to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments to us and our ability to recover investments made, if applicable, in their operations;

(f)

The
financial weakness of some operators and tenants, including potential bankruptcies and downturns in their businesses, which results in uncertainties
regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators' and/or tenants' leases;

(g)

Changes
in federal, state or local laws and regulations, including those affecting the healthcare industry that affect our costs of compliance or increase
the costs, or otherwise affect the operations of our operators, tenants and borrowers;

(h)

The
potential impact of future litigation matters, including the possibility of larger than expected litigation costs, adverse results and related
developments;

(i)

Competition
for tenants and borrowers, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases;



(j)

Our
ability to negotiate the same or better terms with new tenants or operators if existing leases are not renewed or we exercise our right to replace an
existing operator or tenant upon default;

(k)

Availability
of suitable properties to acquire at favorable prices and the competition for the acquisition and financing of those properties;

(l)

The
financial, legal, regulatory and reputational difficulties of significant operators of our properties;

(m)

The
risk that we may not be able to achieve the benefits of investments within expected time-frames or at all, or within expected cost projections;

(n)

The
ability to obtain financing necessary to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms;

(o)

The
risks associated with our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities, including our lack of sole decision making authority and our
reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition and continued cooperation; and

(p)

Changes
in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the U.S. of its obligations.

Except
as required by law, we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or
otherwise.

The
information set forth in this Item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.

Executive Summary

We are a self-administered REIT that, together with our unconsolidated joint ventures, invests primarily in real estate serving the
healthcare industry in the U.S. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers. At December 31, 2013, our portfolio of
investments, including properties owned by our Investment Management Platform, consisted of interests in 1,153 facilities.



Our
business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification and (iii) conservative financing. We actively
redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential or shorter investment horizons into assets representing longer term investments with attractive risk-adjusted return potential. We make
investments where the expected risk-adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to capitalize on our operator, tenant and other business relationships to grow our business.

Our
strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our
management team's experience and our infrastructure. We follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of
properties that no longer fit our strategy.

We
primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under long-term leases with fixed and/or inflation indexed escalators. Most of our rents and other earned income from
leases are received under triple-net leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses; however, some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross
or modified gross leases. Operating expenses are generally related to MOBs and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed by eligible independent contractors on our behalf
("RIDEA properties"). Accordingly, for such MOBs, life science facilities and RIDEA properties, we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance,
property management fees, utilities, employee costs for resident care and insurance. Our growth for these assets depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned
income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels; (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures; and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our
operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. At December 31, 2013, the contractual maturities in our portfolio of leased assets were 17%
through 2017 (measured in dollars of expiring base rents).

Access
to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of
additional securities or secured debt. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy.

2013 Transaction Overview

Investment Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we made investments of $598 million, which included the
following:

•

On May 2, 2013, we acquired £121 million ($188 million) of Barchester Healthcare
("Barchester") debt investments at a discount for £109 million ($170 million). On August 23, 2013, we acquired an additional investment in this loan of
£9 million ($14 million) at a discount for £5 million ($8 million). On September 6, 2013, we received £129 million
($202 million) from the par payoff of our Barchester debt investments; resulting in interest income of $24 million primarily from the unamortized discounts.

•

On June 25, 2013, we funded the $102 million second tranche of our 2012 mezzanine loan facility to Tandem
Health Care, an affiliate of Formation Capital, as part of the recapitalization of a post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio. The funds from the second tranche were used to repay debt senior to our loan.
The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 12% and 14% per annum for the first and second transactions, respectively. The facility will have a total term of up to 63 months from the initial
closing in July 2012. The mezzanine loan facility is subordinate to $443 million of senior mortgage debt.



•

In March 2013, we acquired the four remaining senior housing facilities from our previously announced 2012 Blackstone JV
Acquisition for $38 million.

•

We funded $249 million to acquire a senior housing facility and marketable debt securities, and to fund
construction and other capital projects, primarily in our life science, medical office and senior housing segments.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold 12 properties for $96 million. In addition, in September 2013, we exchanged a 62-bed hospital located in Greenfield,
Wisconsin for a 60-bed hospital located in Webster, Texas.

Financing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we repaid $810 million of aggregate senior unsecured and mortgage debt notes
with a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%.

On
November 12, 2013, we issued $800 million of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2023. The notes were priced at 99.54% of the principal amount with an effective
yield-to-maturity of 4.307%; net proceeds from this offering were $789 million.

Dividends

Quarterly dividends paid during 2013 aggregated $2.10 per share, which represents a 5% increase from 2012. On January 30, 2014,
our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.545 per common share. The annualized distribution rate per share for 2014 increased 3.8% to $2.18, compared to $2.10 for 2013. The
dividend will be paid on February 25, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2014.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires our
management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience
and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances
relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated
financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in
subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require
estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that
we control, through voting rights or other means. We consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("VIEs") when we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A variable interest holder is
considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic



performance
and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

We
make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors
includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic
performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate
in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary
beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. When we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the
variable interest entity, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.

If
we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the VIE (either tenant or borrower) rather than
the results of the variable interest in the VIE. We would require the VIE to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal control of the VIE to determine if we could rely on
the financial information they provide. If the VIE has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely
impact the quality and/or timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting.

Revenue Recognition

At the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to
determine the proper lease classification. A lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee,
(ii) lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property's economic life, or
(iv) the future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) are equal to 90% or more of the excess estimated fair value (over retained tax credits) of the leased building. If one of the
four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predicable and collectible, the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease. If the
assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different, our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different; thus the timing and amount of our revenue
recognized would have been impacted, which may be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We
recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls
the physical use of a leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or control of the physical use of
the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the
tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the
tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. The determination
of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment. If our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were different, the timing and amount of
our revenue recognized would be impacted.

Certain
leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is
recognized when



actual
results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. The recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and
to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. Our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for operating lease straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the
inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis. This evaluation considers
industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease.
We exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

We
use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. For leases
accounted for as DFLs, the net investment in the DFL represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties, less the
unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in
DFLs are presented net of unamortized unearned income. The determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment. If these assessments for accounting purposes
were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.

Loans
receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. We recognize interest income
on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the interest method applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums,
discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans.

Loans
and DFLs are placed on non-accrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on non-accrual status,
loans and
DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, were cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or DFL,
based on management's judgment of collectibility.

Allowances
are established for loans and DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses on an individual basis if they are determined to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it
is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is
complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrower's or lessee's overall financial
condition, resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the net realizable value of any collateral. These estimates
consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's or DFL's effective interest rate, the fair value
of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors. While our assumptions are based in part upon historical data, our estimates
may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.



Real Estate

We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based
upon the relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and in-place leases.
In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and
amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our
evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to
execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.

A
variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project
that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development
include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of
the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially
completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

We assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the real
estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are
largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider market conditions, as well as our intent with respect
to holding or disposing of the asset. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment
charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. Potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations, restructuring plans, current macroeconomic conditions, state of
the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount, we apply the required two-step quantitative approach. The quantitative procedures of the two-step approach (i) compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount, including goodwill and, if necessary, (ii) compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business
combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the
amount of impairment, if any. We estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques, including applying capitalization rates to segment
net operating income, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, as necessary. The fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate
a third party would be willing to pay for the company.



The
determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate
assets and reporting units, future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our ability to accurately predict future operating
results, resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may
have a material impact on our financial results.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee's earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of
operations.

The
initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to
the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method
investment to our carrying value. If we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is other-than-temporary, an
impairment is recorded. The determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is "other-than-temporary" of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant
judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and
trends, severity and duration of the fair value deficiency, and other relevant factors. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates
that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a
material impact on our financial results.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our
compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax
expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal, state and local tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) recognition of built-in gain
associated with prior tax-free acquisitions of C corporations, and
(iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision.

Results of Operations

We evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments: (i) senior housing,
(ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital. Under the senior housing, life science, post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital
segments, we invest or co-invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties, through the acquisition and development of real estate, management of operations ("RIDEA") and by debt issued by
operators in these sectors. Under the medical office segment, we invest or co-invest through the acquisition and development of MOBs that are leased under gross, modified gross or triple-net leases,
generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).



We
use net operating income from continuing operations ("NOI") and adjusted NOI to assess and compare property level performance, including our same property portfolio ("SPP"), and to
make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance. We believe these measures provide investors relevant and useful information because they reflect only
income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unleveraged basis. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI
should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since NOI excludes certain components from net income. Further, NOI may not be comparable to
that of other REITs or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment
information and the relevant reconciliations from net income to NOI and adjusted NOI.

Operating
expenses are generally related to MOB and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed by eligible independent contractors on our behalf (RIDEA
properties). We generally recover all or a portion of MOB and life science expenses from the tenants (tenant recoveries). The presentation of expenses as operating or general and administrative is
based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses.

Our
evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of our SPP and our total property portfolio. SPP information allows us to evaluate the performance
of our leased property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties. We identify our SPP as stabilized properties that remained in
operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or RIDEA properties for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented. Accordingly, it takes a stabilized property a
minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our SPP. Newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of
lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) controls the physical use of at least 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. Newly completed developments and redevelopments, are
considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are
allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2013 to the Year Ended December 31, 2012

During the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013, we acquired a portfolio of 133 senior housing communities from the
Blackstone JV (see additional information in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The transaction closed in two stages: (i) 129 senior housing facilities during the fourth
quarter of 2012 for $1.7 billion; and (ii) four senior housing facilities during the first quarter of 2013 for $38 million. The results of operations from the acquisitions are
reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates.

Segment NOI and Adjusted NOI

The tables below provide selected operating information for our SPP and total property portfolio for each of our five business
segments. Our consolidated SPP consists of 909 properties representing properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized on or prior to January 1, 2012 and that remained in operations
under a consistent reporting structure through December 31, 2013. Our consolidated total property portfolio represents 1,079 and 1,071 properties at December 31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, and excludes properties classified as discontinued operations.

SPP NOI and Adjusted NOI.

SPP NOI decreased primarily as a result of mark-to-market rent reductions on renewed leases. SPP adjusted NOI
decreased
primarily as a result of a $4 million rent payment received in February 2012 in connection with a lease amendment and mark-to-market rent reductions, partially offset by annual rent
escalations.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

In addition to the impact of our SPP, our total portfolio NOI increased primarily as a result of
rents on
recent development projects placed in service during 2013 and 2012.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, 545,000 square feet of new and renewal leases commenced at an average annual base rent of $27.43 per square foot compared to 392,000
square feet of expiring and terminated leases with an average annual base rent of $32.83 per square foot.

From
our past presentation of SPP for the year ended December 31, 2012, we removed two MOBs that were placed into redevelopment in 2013, which no
longer meet our criteria for SPP as of the date they were placed into redevelopment.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

Total portfolio NOI and adjusted NOI increased primarily as a result of the impact of our MOB
acquisitions
during 2012.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, 2.1 million square feet of new and renewal leases commenced at an average annual base rent of $21.54 per square foot compared to
2.2 million square feet of expiring and terminated leases with an average annual base rent of $22.06 per square foot.

SPP and Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

SPP and total portfolio NOI primarily decreased due to a net $12 million correction
of an error
that reduced previously recognized straight-line rents and to increasing amortization of below market lease intangibles related to our Medical City Dallas hospital. SPP and total portfolio adjusted
NOI increased due to annual rent increases, a new lease on our Plano hospital and rents on our Fresno hospital that was placed in service in January 2013.

Other Income and Expense Items

Interest income.

Interest income increased $62 million to $86 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase
was
primarily the result of interest income from the repayment of our Barchester loan in September 2013 (acquired earlier in 2013 at a discount), additional interest income earned from the second tranche
of our mezzanine loan facility to Tandem Health Care in June 2013 and interest earned from our Four Seasons senior unsecured notes purchased in 2012 (see Notes 10 and 7, respectively, to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

Interest expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, interest expense increased $19 million to $435 million. The
increase was
primarily the result of increases in the average outstanding indebtedness during 2013 compared to 2012 and a decrease of capitalized interest in 2013 related to assets that were under development in
our life science and medical office segments and were placed in service during 2013 and 2012. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest rates.



Our
exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our interest rate swap contracts. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk,
see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

and £137 million ($227 million) term loan are presented as fixed-rate debt as the interest payments under such debt have been swapped (pay fixed and receive float). At
December 31, 2012, $86 million of variable-rate mortgages and £137 million ($223 million) term loan are presented as fixed-rate debt as the interest payments
under such debt have been swapped (pay fixed and receive float); the interest rates for swapped debt are presented at the swapped rates.

Depreciation and amortization expense.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $70 million to $423 million for the
year ended
December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily the result of the impact of our senior housing facility and MOB acquisitions during 2012.

General and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $30 million to $109 million for the year
ended
December 31, 2013. The year ended December 31, 2013 included $27.2 million of severance-related charges resulting from the termination of our former Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and President (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). The year ended December 31, 2012 included $7 million related to an
insurance recovery for previously incurred legal expenses.

Impairments.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized impairments of $1 million, included in discontinued
operations, as
a result of the reclassification of two MOBs to held for sale (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). During the year ended December 31, 2012,
we recognized an impairment of $8 million as a result of the planned disposition of a life science land parcel (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information).

Other income, net.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, other income, net increased $15 million to $18 million. The
increase
was primarily the result of gains from the sale of marketable equity securities during 2013 of $11 million.



Income taxes.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, income taxes increased by $7 million to $6 million. The increase in
income
taxes was primarily due to the increase in taxable income of our TRS entities during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, equity income from unconsolidated joint
ventures
increased $10 million to $64 million. The increase was primarily the result of: (i) a one-time distribution received from a senior housing development joint venture that exceeded
our investment balance and (ii) the improved operating performance from our HCR ManorCare equity investment.

Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $74 million, compared
to
$46 million for the comparable period in 2012. The increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $38 million, partially offset by a decline in
operating
income from discontinued operations of $8 million and impairment charges in discontinued operations of $1 million.

Preferred stock dividends.

On March 22, 2012, we announced the redemption of all outstanding shares of preferred stock. On
April 23,
2012, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our preferred stock and paid all accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred a
redemption charge of $10 million related to the original issuance costs of the preferred stock (this charge is presented as an additional preferred stock dividend in our consolidated income
statements).

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2012 to the Year Ended December 31, 2011

During the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired 129 senior housing communities from the Blackstone JV (see additional information in
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The results of operations from the acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates.

On
April 7, 2011, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of HCR ManorCare's real estate assets; additionally, we purchased a noncontrolling equity interest in the
operations of HCR ManorCare. On January 14, 2011, we acquired our partner's 65% interest in HCP Ventures II that resulted in the consolidation of HCP Ventures II. On September 1,
2011, we entered into management contracts with Brookdale with respect to 21 senior living communities (these 21 communities were acquired in January 2011 as part of our purchase of HCP Ventures II).
For the communities that are in a RIDEA structure, the respective resident level revenues and related operating expenses are reported in our consolidated financial statements. See additional
information regarding the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, HCP Ventures II purchase and the Brookdale RIDEA transaction in Notes 3, 8 and 12, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The results of operations from our HCR ManorCare, HCP Ventures II and properties managed under a RIDEA structure are reflected in our financial statements from those respective dates.

Segment NOI and Adjusted NOI

The tables below provide selected operating information for our SPP and total property portfolio for each of our five business
segments. Our consolidated SPP consists of 551 properties representing properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized on or prior to January 1,
2011 and that remained in operations under a consistent reporting structure through December 31, 2012. Our consolidated total property portfolio represents 1,071 and 917 properties at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and excludes properties classified as discontinued operations.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

Including the impact of our SPP, our total portfolio NOI and adjusted NOI for the year ended
December 31, 2012 primarily increased as a result of 66 senior housing leased properties classified as DFLs that were acquired on April 7, 2011 from HCR ManorCare and 127 senior
housing communities acquired on October 31, 2012 and two senior housing communities acquired on December 4, 2012 from the Blackstone JV (see Notes 3, 4 and 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, the Blackstone JV acquisition and Net Investments in DFLs, respectively).

Additionally,
HCP Ventures II was consolidated on January 14, 2011 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), resulting in us
recognizing rental and related revenues for the 25 leased properties commencing on that date. On September 1, 2011, for 21 of these 25 properties, we entered into management contracts in a
structure permitted by RIDEA (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), resulting in the termination of the properties' leases. For these properties that
are in a RIDEA structure, the resident-level revenues and related operating expenses are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning on that date.

SPP and Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

NOI increased primarily as a result of lease expansions and extensions and a decline in
non-reimbursable operating expenses, partially offset by a decline in lease termination fees. Adjusted NOI increased primarily as a result of a $4 million rent payment in connection with a
February 2012 amendment to a lease, annual rent escalations, lease expansions and extensions, and a decline in non-reimbursable operating expenses.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, 978,000 square feet of new and renewal leases commenced at an average annual base rent of $21.71 per square foot compared to 776,000
square feet of expiring and terminated leases with an average annual base rent of $24.23 per square foot. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we acquired 77,000 square feet with an average
annual base rent of $9.79 per square foot.

sale; and (ii) three MOBs that were placed into redevelopment in 2012, which no longer meet our criteria for SPP as of the date they were placed into redevelopment.

SPP NOI and Adjusted NOI.

SPP NOI and adjusted NOI increased year-over-year primarily as a result of rent escalations and an increase in
medical
office occupancy.

Total Portfolio NOI and Adjusted NOI.

Including the impact of our SPP, our total portfolio NOI and adjusted NOI increased primarily as
a result of
the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions during 2012.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, 2.2 million square feet of new and renewal leases commenced at an average annual base rent of $21.94 per square foot compared to
2.1 million square feet of expiring and terminated leases with an average annual base rent of $22.43 per square foot.
During the year ended December 31, 2012, we acquired 1.1 million square feet with an average annual base rent of $22.19 per square foot.

NOI and adjusted NOI increased for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a

Other Income and Expense Items

Interest income.

Interest income decreased $75 million to $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease
was
primarily the result of the following: (i) a decrease of $54 million in income earned from and due to the settlement of our HCR ManorCare debt investments in 2011 and (ii) a
decrease of $43 million in income earned from and as a result of prepayment premiums and unamortized discounts recognized in April 2011 upon the early repayment of our loans to Genesis
HealthCare. The decreases in interest income were partially offset by $19 million of interest earned from our loan and senior unsecured notes investments in 2012 (see Notes 7 and 10,
respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

Interest expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, interest expense increased $717,000 to
$416 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $13 million resulting from our senior unsecured notes offerings, net of related maturities of certain senior unsecured
notes during 2011 and 2012. The increase was offset by the $11 million write-off of unamortized loan fees related to a terminated bridge loan commitment in 2011 and a decrease resulting from
the payoff of certain mortgage debt during 2011.



Our
exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is substantially mitigated by our interest r ate swap contracts. For a more detailed discussion of our
interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

$82 million and $88 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of other debt that represents non-interest bearing

and £137 million ($223 million) term loan are presented as fixed-rate debt as the interest payments under such debt have been swapped (pay fixed and receive float). At
December 31, 2011, $88 million of variable-rate mortgages are presented as fixed-rate debt as the interest payments under such debt have been swapped (pay fixed and receive float); the
interest rates for swapped debt are presented at the swapped rates.

Depreciation and amortization expense.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $8 million to $354 million for the
year ended
December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily the result of additive effects of our acquisitions during 2011 and 2012.

General and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses decreased $17 million to $79 million for the year
ended
December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to an insurance recovery of $7 million during 2012 for previously incurred legal expenses and a decrease of $8 million in
acquisition costs incurred during 2012 compared to similar costs incurred during 2011.

Litigation settlement and provision.

On November 9, 2011, we entered into an agreement with Ventas to settle all remaining claims
relating to
Ventas's litigation against us arising out of Ventas's 2007 acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living REIT. As part of the settlement, we paid $125 million to Ventas, which resulted in a charge for
the same amount (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). No similar charges were recognized during the year
ended December 31, 2012.

Impairments.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment of $8 million as a
result of the disposition of a life science land parcel (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). During the year ended December 31, 2011, we
recognized an impairment of $15 million related to a senior secured term loan as a result of concluding that the carrying value of the loan was in excess of the fair value of the related
collateral supporting the loan (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).



Other income, net.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, other income, net decreased $10 million to $3 million. The
decrease was
primarily the result of a gain of $8 million resulting from our acquisition of our partner's 65% interest in and consolidation of HCP Ventures II in January 2011 (see Note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and $6 million received in connection with a litigation settlement in June 2011 that represents proceeds owed to us from a prior
sale of assets. No similar gain upon consolidation was recognized or settlements were received during the year ended December 31, 2012. The decreases were partially offset by a
$5 million charge during the year ended December 31, 2011 for an other-than-temporary impairment of marketable equity securities.

Income taxes.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, income taxes decreased $3 million to a benefit of $2 million. The
decrease
in income taxes was primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from declines in taxable income of our TRS entities during the year ended December 31, 2012.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily the result of our
equity interest in
HCR ManorCare. The October 2011 CMS reduction of skilled nursing reimbursements under Resource Utilization Group-Version 4 ("RUGs-IV"), together with changes in requirements for the delivery of group
therapy services, reduced HCR ManorCare's revenues and increased its therapy costs in 2012. HCR ManorCare partially mitigated these adverse impacts through a cost reduction program. Further, HCR
ManorCare experienced increased exposure to general and professional liability claims resulting in higher charges in 2012, which, together with the circumstances discussed above, reduced our share in
the earnings from our equity interest in HCR ManorCare.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased $8 million to $54 million. This increase primarily was the result
of the full-year share of earnings from our interest in HCR ManorCare, Inc. compared to a partial-year in 2011 (see Notes 3 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information). Our share of earnings from HCR
ManorCare (equity income) increases for the corresponding reduction of related lease expense recognized at the HCR ManorCare level.

Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $46 million, compared to
$18 million for the comparable period in 2011. The increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $28 million, partially offset by a decline in
operating income from discontinued operations of $1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold real estate investments for $151 million, compared to
$19 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund recurring operating expenses, (ii) meet debt service requirements,
including $487 million of senior unsecured notes and $180 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2014, (iii) fund capital expenditures, including tenant
improvements and leasing costs, (iv) fund acquisition and development activities, and (v) make dividend distributions. We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the
next 12 months will be adequate to fund our business operations, debt service payments, recurring capital expenditures and cash dividends to stockholders. Capital requirements relating to
maturing indebtedness, acquisitions, development and redevelopment activities may require funding from borrowings and/or equity and debt offerings.

Access
to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the
issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly



impact
our cost of capital as well. For example, as noted below, our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin that depends upon our debt
ratings. We also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings. As of January 31, 2014, we had a credit rating of BBB+ from Fitch, Baa1 from Moody's
and BBB+ from S&P on our senior unsecured debt securities.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in operating
cash flows is primarily the result of the following: (i) the impact of our investments in 2012 and 2013, (ii) assets placed in service during 2012 and 2013 and (iii) rent
escalations and resets in 2012 and 2013, which increases were partially offset by increased debt interest payments. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of
multi-tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors.

The
following are significant investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013:

•

made investments of $223 million (loans, development and acquisition of real estate), net of loan repayments of
$263 million and real estate sales of $96 million;

•

paid dividends on common stock of $957 million, which were generally funded by cash provided by our operating
activities;

•

repaid $852 million of mortgages and senior unsecured notes; and

•

raised $800 million in senior unsecured notes.

Debt

Bank line of credit and Term Loan.

Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility matures in March 2016 and contains
a one-year
extension option. Borrowings under the Facility accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings. We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving
commitment that depends on our debt ratings. Based on our debt ratings at January 31, 2014, the margin on the Facility was 1.075%, and the facility fee was 0.175%. The Facility also includes a
feature that will allow us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending
institutions. At December 31, 2013, we had no balance outstanding under this Facility.

On
July 30, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million ($227 million at December 31, 2013) four-year
unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") that accrues interest at a rate of GBP LIBOR plus 1.20%, based on our current debt ratings. Concurrent with the closing of the Term Loan, we entered into a
four-year interest rate swap contract that fixes the rate of the Term Loan at 1.81%, subject to adjustments based on our debt ratings. The Term Loan contains a one-year committed extension option. The
Term Loan was used to finance the purchase of our GBP denominated senior unsecured notes (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

The
Facility and Term Loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreements,
(i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Secured Debt to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30%,
(iii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 60%, (iv) require a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.5 times and (v) require a
formula-determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $9.2 billion at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and
requirements of the Facility and Term Loan.



Our
Facility also contains cross-default provisions to other indebtedness of ours, including in some instances, certain mortgages on our properties. Certain mortgages contain default
provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants, including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of
such operator or tenant. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs, such a default may result in
significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences.

Senior unsecured notes.

At December 31, 2013, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of
$7.0 billion. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 1.21% to 6.98% with a weighted average effective interest rate of 4.97% and a weighted average maturity of six years at December 31,
2013. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt,
maintenance of unencumbered assets, cross-acceleration provisions and other customary terms. At December 31, 2013, we believe we were in compliance with these covenants.

Mortgage debt.

At December 31, 2013, we had $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding that is
secured by
126 healthcare facilities (including redevelopment properties) with a carrying value of $1.8 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 0.69% to 8.69% with a weighted average
effective interest rate of 6.19% and a weighted average maturity of three years at December 31, 2013.

Mortgage
debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts
transfer of the encumbered assets, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the assets in good condition, requires maintenance
of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also cross-collateralized by multiple assets and
may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets.

Other debt.

At December 31, 2013, we had $75 million of non-interest bearing life care bonds at two of our continuing care
retirement
communities and non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at two of our senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively, "Life Care Bonds").
The Life Care Bonds are generally refundable to the residents upon the termination of the contract or upon the successful resale of the unit.

Equity

At December 31, 2013, we had 457.0 million shares of common stock outstanding. At December 31, 2013, equity
totaled $10.9 billion, and our equity securities had a market value of $16.8 billion.

As
of December 31, 2013, there were a total of 4 million DownREIT units outstanding in four limited liability companies in which we are the managing member. The DownREIT
units are



exchangeable
for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as
stock splits and reclassifications).

Shelf Registration

We have a prospectus that we filed with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S-3ASR, using a shelf registration
process which expires in July 2015. Under the "shelf" process, we have the option to sell any one or a combination of the securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. The
securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities and warrants.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure—Funds From Operations ("FFO")

We believe FFO applicable to common shares, diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and basic and diluted FFO per common share are
important supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except
on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market
conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address
this issue.

FFO
as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") is net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or
losses from acquisition and dispositions of depreciable real estate or related interests, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and DFL depreciation and
amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. We compute FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT
definition; however, other REITs may report FFO differently or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from ours. In addition, we present FFO before the impact of
severance-related charges, litigation settlement charges, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments (recoveries) of
non-depreciable assets and merger-related items (defined below) ("FFO as adjusted"). Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the
NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP).

Details
of certain items that affect comparability are discussed under

Results of Operations

above. The following is a reconciliation from

Our
Board of Directors terminated our former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President on October 2, 2013. As a result of the termination, we
incurred severance-related charges of $27.2 million that include: (i) the acceleration of $16.7 million of deferred compensation for restricted stock units and options that vested
upon termination; and (ii) severance payments and other costs of approximately $10.5 million. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(2)

In
connection with the redemption of our preferred stock, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred a redemption charge of
$10.4 million related to the original issuance costs.

(3)

The
litigation settlement charge during the year ended December 31, 2011 relates to the Ventas settlement.

(4)

The
year ended December 31, 2012 merger-related items of $0.02 per share attributable to the Senior Housing Portfolio Acquisition include direct
transaction costs and the impact of the negative carry of prefunding the transaction with the $1.0 billion, or 22 million shares, common stock offering completed on October 19,
2012 on the calculation of weighted average shares. Proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Senior Housing Portfolio Acquisition. Merger-related items for the year ended December 31,
2011 are attributable to our HCR ManorCare Acquisition (incurred from January 1st through April 6th 2011), which include the following: (i) $26.8 million of
direct transaction costs, (ii) $23.9 million of interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion senior unsecured notes issued on January 24, 2011, proceeds from which
were obtained to prefund the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, partially offset by (iii) $24.1 million of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the our debt investment in HCR
ManorCare and other miscellaneous items.

(5)

The
following impairments, net of recoveries had an impact on FFO:

•

The impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2012 relates to the
sale of a land parcel in our life science segment.

•

The impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2011 relates to our
senior secured loan to Delphis.

(6)

Our
weighted average shares used to calculate diluted FFO as adjusted eliminate the impact of 30 million shares from our March 2011 common stock
offering (excludes 4.5 million shares sold to the underwriters upon exercise of their option to purchase additional shares), which issuance increased our weighted average shares by
12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Proceeds from this offering were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as
collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our risk of loss for these certain
properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital
resources except those described below under

Interest
on variable-rate debt is calculated using rates in effect at December 31, 2013.

Inflation

Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other
measures, and/or additional rent based on increases in the tenants' operating revenues. Most of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes,
insurance and utilities. Substantially all of our senior housing, life science, post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs
or reimburse us for all such costs. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases
described above.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards. There were no accounting
pronouncements that were issued, but not yet adopted by us, that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not
use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. See Note 24 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

To
illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments. We applied various basis
point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments' change in fair value. Assuming a one
percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates, the estimated change



in
fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed $6 million. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional analysis details.

Interest Rate Risk.

At December 31, 2013, we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on the
following:
(i) properties with a gross value of $83 million that are subject to leases where the payments fluctuate with changes in LIBOR that are partially offset by (ii) $25 million
of variable-rate senior unsecured notes and (iii) $9 million of variable-rate mortgage debt payable (excludes $72 million of variable-rate mortgage notes that have been hedged
through interest-rate swap contracts) . Additionally, our exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates excludes our GBP denominated $227 million
(£137 million) variable-rate Term Loan that has been hedged through interest-rate swap contracts.

Interest
rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated.
However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings
and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable-rate investments and
variable-rate debt, and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2013, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $1 million, or less than
$0.01 per common share on a diluted basis.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.

At December 31, 2013, our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to forecasted
interest
receipts from our GBP denominated senior unsecured notes (see additional discussion of the Four Seasons senior unsecured notes in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our foreign
currency exchange exposure is mitigated by the forecasted interest and principal payments from our GBP denominated unsecured Term Loan (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information), and a foreign currency swap contract for approximately 85% of the forecasted interest receipts from our Four Seasons senior unsecured notes through their non-call period,
which ends on June 15, 2016.

Market Risk.

We have investments in marketable debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, because we have the positive intent and
ability to
hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity. We consider a variety of
factors in evaluating an other-than-temporary decline in value, such as: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted
carrying value; the issuer's financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects; any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry; and our investment
horizon in relationship to an anticipated near-term recovery in the market value, if any. At December 31, 2013, the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were
$281 million and $244 million, respectively.

The
principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value for our senior
unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices. The fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt



payable
are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.

ITEM 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures

None.

ITEM 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be
disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), to allow for timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired



control
objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Also,
we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain
with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

As
required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2013. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2013, at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2013 to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of HCP, Inc.

Long Beach, California

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
financial statement schedules.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of HCP, Inc.

Long Beach, California

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at
Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of HCP, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 11, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)   Business

HCP, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a Maryland corporation that is organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, together
with its consolidated entities (collectively, "HCP" or the "Company"), invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. The Company acquires, develops, leases,
manages and disposes of healthcare real estate and provides financing to healthcare providers.

(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

Management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from management's estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures or variable
interest entities that it controls through voting
rights or other means. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

The
Company is required to continually evaluate its VIE relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations. A VIE is
broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most
significantly impact the entity's economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial
support.

A
variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact
the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company
qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, the Company's ability to direct the activities that
most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the VIE's governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability and the
rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity.

For
its investments in joint ventures, the Company evaluates the type of ownership rights held by the limited partner(s) that may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the
sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership. The assessment of limited partners' rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the
sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of
the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of
outstanding limited partnership interests. The Company similarly evaluates the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

At the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, the Company assesses its terms and
conditions to determine the proper lease classification. A lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria
are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee, (ii) lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of
the underlying property's economic life, or (iv) the future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) are equal to 90% or more of the excess estimated fair value (over retained tax
credits) of the leased building. If one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predicable and collectible, the lease arrangement is generally
accounted for as a direct financing lease.

The
Company recognizes rental revenue for operating lease arrangements when the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset. If a lease arrangement
provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or the Company. When the Company is the owner of the tenant
improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is
the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded by the Company is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term.
Ownership of tenant improvements is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to, the following criteria:

•

lease stipulations of how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;

•

which party to the arrangement retains legal title to the tenant improvements upon lease expiration;

•

whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general purpose in nature; and

•

if the tenant improvements are expected to have significant residual value at the end of the lease term.

Certain
leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is
recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds, and only after any contingency has been removed (when the related
thresholds are achieved). This may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received.

Tenant
recoveries subject to operating leases related to the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue
in the period the expenses are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented gross, as the Company is generally the primary obligor and, with respect to purchasing goods and services from
third party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk.

For
operating leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, the Company recognizes income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured.
Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in recognized revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If the Company determines that
collectibility of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, an allowance for estimated losses
is established.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Resident
fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges, community fees and other resident charges. Residency agreements are generally for
a term of 30 days to one year, with resident fees billed monthly. Revenue for certain care related services is recognized as services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears.

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for operating lease straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults
or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. The Company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on a continuous basis. This
evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For operating lease straight-line rent amounts, the Company's assessment is based on
amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.

The
Company utilizes the direct finance method of accounting to record income from direct financing leases ("DFLs"). For leases accounted for as DFLs, the net investment in the DFL
represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties, less the unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized
to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured.

Loans
receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Loans held-for-investment are
carried at amortized cost and are reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses as necessary. The Company recognizes interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts
and premiums, using the
interest method. The interest method is applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments
over the term of the related loans. Loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale when management's intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future. Loans
held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.

Allowances
are established for loans and DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses on an individual basis if they are determined to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it
is deemed probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. An allowance is based upon the Company's assessment of the
borrower's or lessee's overall financial condition, economic resources, payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and, if appropriate, the net realizable
value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's or DFL's effective interest rate, fair value
of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors, as appropriate.

Loans
and DFLs are placed on non-accrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on non-accrual status, loans
and DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, were cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or
DFL, based on the Company's expectation of future collectibility.

The
Company recognizes gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of a transaction with the purchaser. Gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when the
collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, the Company is not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant, the initial investment from the buyer is
sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
Company receives management fees from its investments in certain joint venture entities for various services it provides as the managing member. Management fees are recorded as
revenue when management services have been performed. Intercompany profit for management fees is eliminated.

Real Estate

The Company's real estate assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements are recorded at their then fair value at the time of
acquisition and/or consolidation. The assumed liabilities, acquired tangible assets and identifiable intangibles are also recorded at their then fair value. The Company assesses fair value based on
cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and other available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including
historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, as well as market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property is based on the value of the property
as if it is vacant. Transaction costs related to acquisitions of businesses, including properties, are expensed as incurred.

The
Company records acquired "above and below market" leases at their fair value using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is
based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for
each in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with bargain renewal options.
Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each property and the respective tenant's
lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the
Company includes estimates of lost rents at estimated market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions and expected trends. In estimating
costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.

The
Company capitalizes direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to
the acquisition, development or construction of a real estate asset. The Company capitalizes construction and development costs while substantive activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its
intended use. The Company considers a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of company owned tenant improvements, but no later than one
year from cessation of significant construction activity. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, or after development activities have ceased, are
expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the Company capitalizes costs based on the net carrying value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for
the construction and improvement incurred in connection with the redevelopment. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings. Expenditures for
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company considers costs incurred in conjunction with re-leasing properties, including tenant improvements and lease commissions, to represent the
acquisition of productive assets and, accordingly, such costs are reflected as investing activities in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.

The
Company computes depreciation on properties using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful life. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as
held-for-sale. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over useful lives ranging up to 50 years. Above and below

F-11

market
lease intangibles are amortized primarily to revenue over the remaining noncancellable lease terms and bargain renewal periods, if any. In-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over
the remaining noncancellable lease term and bargain renewal periods, if any.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company tests its real estate assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows to
the carrying value of the real estate assets. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss will be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the
real estate assets is greater than its fair value.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. Potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations, restructuring plans, current macroeconomic conditions, state of
the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of the Company's market capitalization. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company applies the required two-step quantitative approach. The quantitative procedures of the two-step approach (i) compares the fair
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill and, if necessary, (ii) compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that
goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the
implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment, if any. The Company selected the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to perform its annual impairment test.

Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued Operations

Certain long-lived assets are classified as held-for-sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value
less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. Discontinued operations is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is deemed to be held-for-sale and, (i) the operations
and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction, and (ii) the entity will not have any significant continuing
involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which the Company does not consolidate but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company's share of the investee's earnings or losses are included in the Company's
consolidated results of operations.

The
initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the fair value of the assets prior to the
sale of interests in the joint venture. To the extent that the Company's cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is generally amortized over
the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in the Company's share of equity in earnings of the joint

F-12


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

venture.
The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When the Company determines
a decline in the fair value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. The Company recognizes gains on the sale of
interests in joint ventures to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

The
Company's fair values for its equity method investments are based on discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period
and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums or discounts. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit
spreads utilized in these models are based upon assumptions that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments.

Share-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for share-based awards granted to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the
consolidated statements of income based on their grant date fair market value. Compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules is generally recognized ratably over the period from the
grant date to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional services.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts held by mortgage lenders to provide for (i) real estate tax expenditures, tenant
improvements and capital expenditures, and (ii) security deposits and net proceeds from property sales that were executed as tax-deferred dispositions.

Derivatives

During its normal course of business, the Company uses certain types of derivative instruments for the purpose of managing interest
rate and currency risk. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivative instruments used for risk management purposes must effectively reduce the risk exposure that they are designed to hedge. In
addition, at inception of a qualifying cash flow hedging
relationship, the underlying transaction or transactions, must be, and are expected to remain, probable of occurring in accordance with the Company's related assertions.

The
Company recognizes all derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives required to be bifurcated, as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair
value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the criteria of hedge accounting are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated
in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships, the change in fair value of the effective portion of the derivatives is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), whereas the change
in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings.

The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. This process includes designating all derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship to specific

F-13


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

forecasted
transactions as well as recognized obligations or assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also assesses and documents, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on a
quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives that are designated in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the designated risks associated with the respective hedged items. If
it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or that it is probable the underlying forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting
prospectively and records the appropriate adjustment to earnings based on the current fair value of the derivative.

Income Taxes

HCP, Inc. elected REIT status and believes it has always operated so as to continue to qualify as a REIT under
Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Accordingly, HCP, Inc. will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that it continues to
qualify as a REIT and makes distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of its taxable income. In addition, the Company has formed several consolidated subsidiaries, which have elected REIT
status. HCP, Inc. and its consolidated REIT subsidiaries are each subject to the REIT qualification requirements under Sections 856 to 860 of the Code. If any REIT fails to qualify as a
REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years.

HCP, Inc.
and its consolidated REIT subsidiaries are subject to state and local income taxes in some jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances each REIT may also be subject to
federal excise taxes on undistributed income. In addition, certain activities that the Company undertakes may be conducted by entities which elect to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs").
TRSs are subject to both federal and state income taxes. The Company recognizes tax penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as additional income tax expense. Interest relating to unrecognized
tax benefits is recognized as interest expense.

Marketable Securities

The Company classifies its marketable equity securities as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at their fair value with
unrealized gains and losses recognized in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined based on the specific
identification method. When the Company determines declines in fair value of marketable securities are other-than-temporary, a loss is recognized in earnings.

The
Company classifies its marketable debt securities as held-to-maturity, because the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity.

Capital Raising Issuance Costs

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of common shares are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Costs
incurred in connection with the issuance of preferred shares are recorded as a reduction of the preferred stock amount. Debt issuance costs are deferred, included in other assets and amortized to
interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt utilizing the interest method.

F-14


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Segment Reporting

The Company's segments are based on its internal method of reporting which classifies operations by healthcare sector. The Company's
business operations include five segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital.

Noncontrolling Interests

The Company reports arrangements with noncontrolling interests as a component of equity separate from the parent's equity. The Company
accounts for purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in
consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated statements of income and, upon a gain or loss of control, the interest purchased or sold, as well as any interest retained, is recorded at its
fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.

The
Company consolidates non-managing member limited liability companies ("DownREITs") because it exercises control, and noncontrolling interests in these entities are carried at cost.
The non-managing member LLC Units ("DownREIT units") are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of the Company's common stock or, at the
Company's option, shares of the Company's common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). Upon exchange of DownREIT units for the Company's common stock, the
carrying amount of the DownREIT units is reclassified to stockholders' equity.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into U.S. dollars use exchange rates in effect at the end
of the period, and revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into U.S. dollars use average rates of exchange in effect during the related period. Gains or losses
resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The effects of transaction gains or losses are included in other income,
net in the consolidated statements of income.

Preferred Stock Redemptions

The Company recognizes the excess of the redemption value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock redeemed over its carrying amount as
a charge to earnings.

Life Care Bonds Payable

Certain of the Company's continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs") issue non-interest bearing life care bonds payable to certain
residents of the CCRCs. Generally, the bonds are refundable to the resident or to the resident's estate upon termination or cancellation of the CCRC agreement or upon the successful resale of the
unit. Proceeds from the issuance of new bonds are used to retire existing bonds, and since the maturity of the obligations for the facilities is not determinable, no interest is imputed. These amounts
are included in other debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Fair Value Measurement

The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of
valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value

F-15


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

measurement
are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's
market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These inputs have created the following fair value
hierarchy:

•

Level 1

—quoted prices for

identical

instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2

—quoted prices for

similar

instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical
or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations
in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and

•

Level 3

—fair value measurements derived from valuation
techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are

unobservable

.

The
Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value. When
available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1. In some instances where a market price
is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and classifies the asset or liability in
Level 2.

If
quoted market prices or inputs are not available, fair value measurements are based upon valuation models that utilize current market or independently sourced market inputs, such as
interest rates, option volatilities, credit spreads and/or market capitalization rates. Items valued using such internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 even though there may be some significant
inputs that are readily observable. Internal fair value models and techniques used by the Company include discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes valuation models. The Company also considers its
counterparty's and own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at their fair value. The Company has elected the mid-market pricing expedient when determining fair value.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company accounts for unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or
unpaid) as participating securities, which are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class
method. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by including the effect of dilutive and preferred securities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-10,

Inclusion of the Fed Funds Effective Swap
Rate (or Overnight Index Swap Rate) as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes (a consensus of the FASB Emerging
Issues Task Force)

("ASU 2013-10"). This update permits the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate to be used as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic
815, in addition to the interest rates on direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. government and the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). The amendments are effective prospectively for qualifying
new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after July 17, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2013-10 on July 17, 2013 did not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

(3)   HCR ManorCare Acquisition

On April 7, 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of HCR ManorCare, Inc. ("HCR ManorCare"), for
a purchase price of $6.0 billion (the "HCR ManorCare Acquisition"). The purchase price consisted of the following: (i) $4 billion in cash consideration; and
(ii) $2 billion representing the fair value of the Company's HCR ManorCare debt investments that were settled as part of this acquisition. Through this transaction, the Company acquired
334 HCR ManorCare post-acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The facilities are located in 30 states, with the highest concentrations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois and
Michigan. A wholly-owned subsidiary of HCR ManorCare operates the assets pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement supported by a guaranty from HCR ManorCare. Additionally, the Company
exercised its option to purchase an ownership interest of HCR ManorCare for $95 million that represented a 9.9% equity interest at closing.

(4)   Other Real Estate Property Investments

Senior Housing Portfolio Acquisition

During the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013, the Company acquired 133 senior housing communities for
$1.74 billion from a joint venture between Emeritus Corporation ("Emeritus") and Blackstone Real Estate Partners VI, an affiliate of the Blackstone Group (the "Blackstone JV"). Located in 29
states, the portfolio encompasses a diversified care mix of 61% assisted living, 25% independent living, 13% memory care and 1% skilled nursing based on units. Based on operating performance at
closing, the 133 communities consisted of 99 that were stabilized and 34 that were in lease-up. The transaction closed in two stages: (i) 129 senior housing facilities during the fourth quarter
of 2012 for $1.7 billion; and (ii) four senior housing facilities during the first quarter of 2013 for $38 million. The Company paid $1.73 billion in cash consideration and
assumed $13 million of mortgage debt to acquire: (i) real estate with a fair value of $1.57 billion, (ii) intangible assets with a fair value of $174 million; and
(iii) assumed intangible liabilities with a fair value of $4 million. The lease-up intangibles assets recognized were attributable to the value of the acquired underlying operating
resident leases of the senior housing communities that were stabilized or nearly stabilized (e.g., resident occupancy above 80%).

Emeritus
operates the communities pursuant to two triple-net master leases for 128 properties (the "Master Lease") and five individual leases, all guaranteed by Emeritus (together, the
"Leases"). The Leases provide aggregate contractual rent in the first year of $105.8 million. The contractual rent will increase annually by the greater of the percentage increase in the
Consumer Price Index ("CPI") or 3.7% on average over the initial five years, and thereafter by the greater of CPI or 3.0% for the remaining initial lease term. At the beginning of the sixth lease
year, rent on the 34 lease-up properties will increase to the greater of the percentage increase in CPI or fair market, subject to a floor of 103% and a cap of 130% of the prior year's rent. From the
2012 acquisition dates to December 31, 2012, the Company recognized revenues and income of $22 million and $14 million, respectively, related to its acquisitions of the 129 senior
housing communities.

The
Master Lease properties are grouped into three pools that share comparable characteristics. The Leases have initial terms of 14 to 16 years. Emeritus has two extension
options, which, if exercised, will provide for lease terms of 30 to 35 years.

Concurrent
with the acquisition in 2012, Emeritus purchased nine communities from the Blackstone JV, for which the Company provided secured debt financing of $52 million with a
four-year term. The loan is secured by the underlying real estate and is prepayable at Emeritus' option. The interest rate on the loan was initially 6.1% and will gradually increase during its four
year term to 6.8%.

The
minimum lease payments receivable are primarily attributable to HCR ManorCare, Inc. ("HCR ManorCare") ($23.5 billion and
$24.0 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively). The triple-net master lease with HCR ManorCare provides for annual rent of $506 million beginning April 1, 2013
(prior to April 1, 2013, annual rent was $489 million). The rent increases by 3.5% per year over the next three years and by 3% for the remaining portion of the initial lease term. The
properties are grouped into four pools, and HCR ManorCare has a one-time extension option for each pool with rent increased for the first year of the extension option to the greater of fair market
rent or a 3% increase over the rent for the prior year. Including the extension options, which the Company determined to be bargain renewal options, the four leased pools had total initial available
terms ranging from 23 to 35 years.

F-21


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On
November 21, 2013, the Company reached an agreement with Tenet Healthcare Corporation to modify and extend three acute care hospital leases. The leases were extended at current
rent levels and contain annual CPI-based escalators under staggered terms from three to eight years with purchase options exercisable for a fixed price at the end of each term. As a result of these
lease modifications, the Company reassessed the classification of the leases and accounted for the lease agreements as DFLs.

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2013, the Company placed a 14-property senior housing DFL (the "DFL Portfolio") on non-accrual status. Based on the Company's determination
that the collection of all rental payments is no longer reasonably assured, rental revenue for the DFL Portfolio will be recognized on a cash basis. Furthermore, the Company assessed the DFL Portfolio
for impairment. The Company determined that the DFL Portfolio was not impaired at September 30, 2013, based on its belief that: (i) it is not probable that it will not collect all of the
rental payments under the terms of the lease; and (ii) the fair value of the underlying collateral exceeds the DFL Portfolio's $376 million carrying amount. The fair value of the DFL
Portfolio was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model, the inputs to which are considered to be a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Inputs to this valuation model
include real estate capitalization rates, industry growth rates and operating margins, some of which influence the Company's expectation of future cash flows from the DFL Portfolio and, accordingly,
the fair value of its investment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized DFL income of $24.4 million, $27.8 million and $27.5 million,
respectively, and received cash payments of $24.0 million, $23.8 million and $21.9 million, respectively, from the DFL Portfolio.

On
April 7, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of 334 HCR ManorCare properties subject to a single master lease that the Company classified as a DFL. See discussion of
the HCR ManorCare Acquisition in Note 3.

Certain
leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial investment amount plus
adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements. Certain leases also permit the Company to require the tenants to purchase the properties at the end of the lease terms.

Future
minimum lease payments contractually due under DFLs at December 31, 2013, were as follows (in thousands):

Company
acquired an additional investment in this loan of £9 million ($14 million) at a discount for £5 million ($8 million). This loan accrued
interest on its face value at a floating rate of LIBOR plus a weighted-average margin of 3.14%. This loan investment was financed by a GBP denominated draw on the Company's revolving line of credit
facility that is discussed in Note 11. On September 6, 2013, the Company received £129 million ($202 million) from the par payoff of its Barchester debt
investments; as a result, the Company recognized interest income of $24 million representing primarily the debt investment's unamortized discounts. A portion of the proceeds from the Barchester
repayment were used to repay the total outstanding amount of the Company's GBP denominated draw on its revolving line of credit facility.

Tandem Health Care Loan.

On July 31, 2012, the Company closed a mezzanine loan facility to lend up to $205 million to Tandem
Health
Care ("Tandem"), as part of the recapitalization of a post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio. At closing, this loan was subordinate to $400 million in senior mortgage debt and $137 million
in other senior mezzanine debt. The Company funded $100 million (the "First Tranche") at closing and funded an additional $102 million (the "Second Tranche") in June 2013. The Second
Tranche was used to by Tandem repay the senior mezzanine debt. At December 31, 2013, the loans were subordinate to $443 million of senior mortgage debt. The loans bear interest at fixed
rates of 12% and 14% per annum for the First and Second Tranches, respectively. This loan facility has a total term of up to 63 months from the First Tranche closing, is prepayable at the
borrower's option and is secured by real estate partnership interests. The loans are subject to a prepayment premiums if repaid on or before the third anniversary from the First Tranche closing date.

Delphis Operations, L.P. Loan.

The Company holds a secured term loan made to Delphis Operations, L.P. ("Delphis" or the
"Borrower")
that is collateralized by all of the assets of the Borrower. The Borrower's collateral is comprised primarily of interests in partnerships operating surgical facilities, of which one partnership
leases a property owned by the Company. In December 2009, the Company determined that the loan was impaired. Further, in January 2011 the Company placed the loan on cost-recovery status, whereby
accrual of interest income was suspended, and any payments received from the Borrower are applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan.

As
part of a March 2012 agreement (the "2012 Agreement") between Delphis, certain past and current principals of Delphis and the Cirrus Group, LLC (the "Guarantors"), and the
Company, the Company agreed, among other things, to allow the distribution of $1.5 million to certain of the Guarantors from funds generated from sales of assets that were pledged as additional
collateral for this loan. Further, the Company, as part of the 2012 Agreement, agreed to provide financial incentives to the Borrower regarding the liquidation of the primary collateral assets for
this loan.

Pursuant
to the 2012 Agreement, the Company received the remaining cash ($4.8 million, after reducing this amount by $0.5 million for related legal expenses) and other
consideration ($2.1 million) of $6.9 million from the Guarantors. In addition, during 2012, the Company received $38.1 million in net proceeds from the sales of two of the primary
collateral assets, which proceeds, together with the cash payments and other consideration, were applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. The carrying value of the loan, net of an allowance
for loan losses of $13 million, was $18.1 million and $30.7 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. At December 31, 2013, the Company believes the fair
value of the collateral supporting this loan is in excess of its carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company received cash payments of
$12.6 million, $43 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

HCR ManorCare Loans.

In December 2007, the Company made a $900 million investment (at a discount of $100 million) in HCR
ManorCare
mezzanine loans, which paid interest at a floating rate of

plus 4.0%. Also, in August 2009 and January 2011, the Company purchased $720 million (at a discount of $130 million) and $360 million, respectively, in participations in HCR
ManorCare first mortgage debt, which paid interest at LIBOR plus 1.25%.

On
April 7, 2011, upon closing of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, the Company's $2.0 billion of loans to HCR ManorCare were settled, which resulted in additional interest
income of $23 million, which
represents the excess of the loans' fair values above their carrying values at the acquisition date. See Note 3 for additional discussion related to the HCR ManorCare Acquisition.

Genesis HealthCare Loans.

In September and October 2010, the Company purchased participations in a senior loan and mezzanine note of
Genesis
HealthCare ("Genesis") with par values of $278 million (at a discount of $28 million) and $50 million (at a discount of $10 million), respectively. The Genesis senior loan
paid interest at LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.5%, increasing to 2.5% by maturity) plus a spread of 4.75%, increasing to 5.75% by maturity. The senior loan was secured by all of Genesis' assets. The
mezzanine note paid interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 7.50%. In addition to the coupon interest payments, the mezzanine note required the payment of a termination fee, of which the Company's share
prior to the early repayment of this loan was $2.3 million.

On
April 1, 2011, the Company received $330.4 million from the early repayment of its loans to Genesis, and recognized additional interest income of $34.8 million,
which represents the related unamortized discounts and termination fee.

(3)

The
combined net loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes impairments, net of the related tax benefit, of $865 million related to
HCR ManorCare's goodwill and intangible assets. The impairments at the operating entity were the result of reduced cash flows primarily caused by the reimbursement reductions for the Medicare skilled
nursing facility Prospective Payment System announced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services effective October 1, 2011. The combined net loss for the year ended
December 31, 2013 includes tax expense of $400 million related to recording of a valuation allowance which was necessary to reduce the carrying value of HCR ManorCare's deferred tax
assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized as determined by HCR ManorCare's management. HCR ManorCare's goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets were not previously
considered in the Company's initial investments in the operations of HCR ManorCare; therefore, the related impairments and valuation allowance against the carrying value of the deferred tax assets did
not impact the Company's recorded investment. As such, HCR ManorCare's impairments during the year ended December 31, 2011 and tax expense related to the valuation allowance during the year
ended December 31, 2013 did not have an impact on the Company's share of earnings from or its investment in HCR ManorCare.

(4)

The
Company's joint venture interest in HCR ManorCare is accounted for using the equity method and results in an ongoing reduction of DFL income,
proportional to HCP's ownership in HCR ManorCare. As required to eliminate intercompany profit, the Company recharacterized $62.1 million, $59.4 million and $42.2 million of DFL
income to the Company's share of earnings from HCR ManorCare (equity income) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Four Seasons Health Care Senior Unsecured Notes

On June 28, 2012, the Company purchased senior unsecured notes with an aggregate par value of £138.5 million
at a discount for £136.8 million ($214.9 million). The notes were issued by Elli Investments Limited, a subsidiary of Terra Firma, a European private equity firm, as part of
its financing for the acquisition of Four Seasons Health Care ("Four Seasons"), an elderly and specialist care provider in the United Kingdom. The notes mature in June 2020 and are non-callable
through June 2016. The notes bear interest on their par value at a fixed rate of 12.25% per annum, with an original issue discount resulting in a yield to maturity of 12.5%. This investment was
financed by a GBP denominated unsecured term loan that is discussed in Note 11. These senior unsecured notes are accounted for as marketable debt securities and classified as held-to-maturity.

(11) Debt

Bank Line of Credit and Term Loan

The Company's $1.5 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility (the "Facility") matures in March 2016 and contains a
one-year extension option. Borrowings under the Facility accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin that depends on the Company's debt ratings. The Company pays a facility fee on the entire revolving
commitment that depends upon its debt ratings. Based on the Company's debt ratings at December 31, 2013, the margin on the Facility was 1.075%, and the facility fee was 0.175%. The Facility
also includes a feature that will allow the Company to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, subject to securing additional commitments from existing
lenders or new lending institutions. At December 31, 2013, the Company had no balance outstanding under this Facility.

On
July 30, 2012, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million ($227 million at December 31, 2013)
four-year unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") that accrues interest at a rate of GBP LIBOR plus 1.20%, based on the Company's current debt ratings. Concurrent with the closing of the Term Loan, the
Company entered into a four-year interest rate swap contract that fixes the interest rate of the Term Loan at 1.81%, subject to adjustments based on the Company's debt ratings. The Term Loan contains
a one-year committed extension option.

The
Facility and Term Loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements, including cross-default provisions to other indebtedness. Among other things, these
covenants, using terms defined in the agreements, (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Secured Debt to
Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30%, (iii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 60%, (iv) require a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.5
times and (v) require a formula-determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $9.2 billion at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance
with each of these restrictions and requirements of the Facility and Term Loan.

Senior Unsecured Notes

At December 31, 2013, the Company had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of
$7.0 billion. At December 31, 2013, interest rates on the notes ranged from 1.21% to 6.98% with a weighted average effective rate of 4.97% and a weighted average maturity of six years.
Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related senior unsecured notes. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt,

Mortgage
debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts
transfer of the encumbered assets, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the assets in good condition, requires maintenance
of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into or terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also cross-collateralized by multiple assets and
may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets.

Other Debt

At December 31, 2013, the Company had $75 million of non-interest bearing life care bonds at two of its continuing care
retirement communities and non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at two of its senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively, "Life
Care Bonds"). The Life Care Bonds are generally
refundable to the residents upon the termination of the contract or upon the successful resale of the unit.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of the
Company's business. Except as described in this Note 12, the Company is not aware of any other legal proceedings or claims that it believes may have, individually or taken together, a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company's policy is to accrue legal expenses as they are incurred.

On
May 3, 2007, Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas") filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging, among other
things, that the Company interfered with Ventas's prospective business advantage in connection with Ventas's 2007 acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT").
Ventas sought compensatory damages in excess of $300 million plus punitive damages. Prior to the jury deliberations, the District Court dismissed, among other rulings, Ventas's claim for
punitive damages. On September 4, 2009, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Ventas in the amount of approximately $102 million. The Company recognized $102 million as a
provision for litigation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2009. Both Ventas and the Company appealed various rulings of the District Court and the jury verdict to the United
States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. On May 17, 2011, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred by not submitting Ventas's claim for punitive damages to the jury,
and affirmed the District Court's judgment in all other respects. On August 23, 2011, the Company paid Ventas $102 million resulting from the jury verdict. On November 9, 2011,
the Company and Ventas settled all claims relating to the litigation and the Company paid $125 million to Ventas in addition to the $102 million paid in August 2011.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risks arise when one or more operators, tenants or obligors related to the Company's investments are engaged
in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the
Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. The Company regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio to assess potential concentrations of risks. The Company does not
have significant foreign operations.

The
following table provides information regarding the Company's concentrations with respect to certain operators and tenants; the information provided is presented for the gross assets
and revenues that are associated with certain operators and tenants as percentages of the respective segment's and total Company's assets and revenues:

Certain
of the Company's properties are leased to tenants who have entered into management contracts with Sunrise to operate the respective property on
their behalf. The Company's concentration of gross assets includes properties directly leased to Sunrise and properties that are managed by Sunrise on behalf of third party tenants.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(3)

On
April 7, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of HCR ManorCare's real estate assets, which included the settlement of the Company's HCR
ManorCare debt investments, see Notes 3 and 7 for additional information.

(4)

Percentages
do not include senior housing facilities that Brookdale operates on the Company's behalf under a RIDEA structure.

On September 1, 2011, the Company completed a strategic venture with Brookdale that includes the operation of 37 Company-owned senior
living communities previously leased to or operated by Horizon Bay Retirement Living ("Horizon Bay"). As part of this transaction, Brookdale acquired Horizon Bay
and: (i) assumed an existing triple-net lease for nine HCP communities; (ii) entered into a new triple-net lease related to four HCP communities; (iii) assumed Horizon Bay's
management of three HCP communities, one of which was recently developed by HCP; and (iv) entered into management contracts and a joint venture agreement for a 10% interest in the real estate
and operations for 21 of the Company's communities in a RIDEA structure. In connection with these transactions, the Company purchased approximately one million shares of Brookdale's common stock in
June 2011 (see Note 10 for additional information regarding these marketable equity securities).

To
mitigate credit risk of leasing properties to certain senior housing and post-acute/skilled nursing operators, leases with operators are often combined into portfolios that contain
cross-default terms, so that if a tenant of any of the properties in a portfolio defaults on its obligations under its lease, the Company may pursue its remedies under the lease with respect to any of
the properties in the portfolio. Certain portfolios also contain terms whereby the net operating profits of the properties are combined for the purpose of securing the funding of rental payments due
under each lease.

At
December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company's gross real estate assets in the state of California, excluding assets held-for-sale, represented approximately 23% and 21% of the
Company's total assets, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company's revenues derived from properties located in the states of California, Texas and Florida represented
approximately 21%, 11% and 9% of the Company's total revenues, respectively.

DownREIT LLCs

In connection with the formation of certain DownREIT limited liability companies ("LLCs"), members may contribute appreciated real
estate to a DownREIT LLC in exchange for DownREIT units. These contributions are generally tax-deferred, so that the pre-contribution gain related to the property is not taxed to the member.
However, if a contributed property is later sold by the DownREIT LLC, the unamortized pre-contribution gain that exists at the date of sale is specifically allocated and taxed to the
contributing members. In many of the DownREITs, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with those members who contributed appreciated property into the DownREIT LLC. Under
these indemnification agreements, if any of the appreciated real estate contributed by the members is sold by the DownREIT LLC in a taxable transaction within a specified number of years, the
Company will reimburse the affected members for the federal and state income taxes associated with the pre-contribution gain that is specially allocated to the affected member under the Code
("make-whole payments"). These make-whole payments include a tax gross-up provision. These indemnification agreements have expiration terms that range through 2033.

Credit Enhancement Guarantee

Certain of the Company's senior housing facilities serve as collateral for $112 million of debt (maturing May 1, 2025)
that is owed by a previous owner of the facilities. This indebtedness is

F-36


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

guaranteed
by the previous owner who has an investment grade credit rating. These senior housing facilities, which are classified as DFLs, had a carrying value of $374 million as of
December 31, 2013.

Environmental Costs

The Company monitors its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
liability with respect to the properties that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company carries environmental insurance
and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limitations and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and current
industry practice.

General Uninsured Losses

The Company obtains various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property, business interruption, liability, flood, windstorm,
earthquake, environmental and terrorism related losses. The Company attempts to obtain appropriate policy terms, conditions, limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss, the cost of
such coverage and current industry practice. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not
economically insurable. In addition, the Company has a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake, flood and windstorm occurrences for which the related insurances carry high
deductibles.

Tenant Purchase Options

Certain leases, including DFLs, contain purchase options whereby the tenant may elect to acquire the underlying real estate. Annualized
base rent from leases subject to purchase options, summarized by the year the purchase options are exercisable are as follows (dollars in thousands):

intangibles, DFL interest accretion and deferred revenues).

Rental Expense

The Company's rental expense attributable to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was
approximately $8 million, $7 million and $6 million, respectively. These rental expense amounts include ground rent and other leases. Ground leases generally require fixed annual

4 million DownREIT units were $184 million and $217 million, respectively.

(14) Segment Disclosures

The Company evaluates its business and makes resource allocations based on its five business segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) post-acute/skilled
nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital. Under the senior housing, post-acute/skilled nursing, life science and hospital segments, the Company invests or
co-invests primarily in single operator or tenant properties, through the acquisition and development of real estate, management of operations (RIDEA) and by debt issued by operators in these sectors.
Under the medical office segment, the Company invests or co-invests through the acquisition and development of medical office buildings ("MOBs") that are leased under gross, modified gross or
triple-net leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described under
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). There were no intersegment sales or transfers during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The Company evaluates
performance based upon property net operating income from continuing operations ("NOI"), adjusted NOI (cash NOI) and interest income of the combined investments in each segment.

Non-segment
assets consist primarily of corporate assets including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, net, marketable equity securities, deferred financing
costs and, if any, real estate held-for-sale. Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and non-property specific

NOI
is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. The Company defines NOI as rental and related
revenues, including tenant recoveries, resident fees and services, and income from DFLs, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes interest income, investment management fee income,
interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, litigation settlement, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, income taxes, equity income from and
impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and discontinued operations. The Company believes NOI provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and
operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. Adjusted NOI is calculated as NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL
accretion, amortization of above and below market

lease
intangibles, and lease termination fees. Adjusted NOI is sometimes referred to as "cash NOI." The Company uses NOI and adjusted NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and
compare property level performance. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating
performance to net income as defined by GAAP because it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, the Company's definition of NOI may not be comparable to the definition used by
other REITs or real estate companies, as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.

(16) Compensation Plans

Stock Based Compensation

On May 11, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the 2006 Performance Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "2006
Incentive Plan"). The 2006 Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock and performance restricted stock units to officers, employees
and directors in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. On April 23, 2009, the Company's stockholders amended the 2006 Incentive Plan. As a result of the
amendment, the maximum number of shares reserved for awards under the 2006 Incentive Plan, as amended, is 23.2 million shares. The maximum number of shares available for future awards under the

F-42


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Incentive Plan is 5.6 million shares at December 31, 2013, of which approximately 3.7 million shares may be issued as restricted stock and performance restricted stock units.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted with an exercise price per share equal to the closing market price of the company's common stock on the grant
date. Stock options generally vest ratably over a four- to five-year period and have a 10-year contractual term. Vesting of certain options may accelerate, as provided in the 2006 Incentive Plan or in
the applicable award agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other specified events. Upon the exercise of options, the participant is required to pay the exercise price of the options being
exercised and the related tax withholding obligation. Participants have the ability to elect to have the Company withhold the number of shares to be delivered upon exercise of stock options to pay the
related exercise price and tax withholding obligation. The value of the shares withheld is dependent upon the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date that the relevant
transaction occurs.

The
weighted average fair value per share at the date of grant for options awarded during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $5.89, $6.34 and $5.97,
respectively. The total vesting date intrinsic value (at vesting) of shares under options vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $12 million,
$18 million and $16 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of vested shares under options at December 31, 2013 was $5 million.

Proceeds
received from options exercised under the 2006 Incentive Plan for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $18 million, $52 million and
$31 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (at exercise) of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $25 million, $51 million
and $13 million, respectively.

The
fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model
that uses the assumptions described below. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the
stock options granted was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees and turnover rates. For stock options granted in 2013, 2012 and 2011, the expected volatility was based on the
average of the Company's: (i) historical volatility of the adjusted closing prices of its common stock for a period equal to the stock option's expected life, ending on the grant date,
calculated on a weekly basis and (ii) the implied volatility of traded options on its common stock for a period equal to 30 days ending on the grant date. For stock options granted prior
to 2010, the expected volatility was based on the Company's historical volatility of the adjusted closing prices of its common stock for a period equal to the stock option's expected life, ending on
the grant date and calculated on a weekly basis. The following table summarizes the Company's stock option valuation assumptions used with respect to stock options awarded in 2013, 2012 and 2011:

Restricted Stock and Performance Restricted Stock Units

Under the 2006 Incentive Plan, restricted stock and performance restricted stock units generally have a contractual life or vest over a
three- to five-year period. The vesting of certain restricted shares and

F-44


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

units
may accelerate, as provided in the 2006 Incentive Plan or in the applicable award agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other specified events. When vested, each performance
restricted stock unit is convertible into one share of common stock. The restricted stock and performance restricted stock units are valued on the grant date based on the closing market price of the
Company's common stock on that date. Generally, the Company recognizes the fair value of the awards over the applicable vesting period as compensation expense. Upon any exercise or payment of
restricted shares or units, the participant is required to pay the related tax withholding obligation. Participants generally have the flexibility to elect to have the Company reduce the number of
shares to be delivered to pay the related tax withholding obligation. The value of the shares withheld is dependent on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date that the
relevant transaction occurs. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company withheld 242,000, 361,000 and 136,000 shares, respectively, to offset tax withholding obligations with respect to the restricted
stock and restricted stock unit awards.

At
December 31, 2013, the weighted average remaining vesting period of restricted stock units and restricted stock was two years. The total fair values (at vesting) of restricted
stock and restricted stock units which vested for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $22 million, $39 million and $14 million, respectively.

As
the Company pays dividends on its outstanding common stock, holders of restricted stock awards are generally entitled to any dividends on the underlying restricted shares, and holders
of restricted stock units generally have the right to a cash payment equal to the dividends that would be paid on a number of shares of Company common stock equal to the number of outstanding units
subject to the award.

On
August 14, 2006, the Company granted 219,000 restricted stock units to the Company's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The restricted stock units vest over a period
of 10 years beginning in 2012, subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances as provided in the applicable award
agreement and the Company's employment agreement with its former Chief Executive Officer. Each vested unit will be convertible, upon payment of the award, into one share of common stock. Additionally,
as the Company pays dividends on its outstanding common stock, the original award will be credited with additional restricted stock units as dividend equivalents (in lieu of receiving a cash payment).
Generally, the dividend equivalent restricted stock units will be subject to the same vesting and other conditions as applied to the grant.

The
Company's Board of Directors terminated its former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President on October 2, 2013. As a result of the termination, general and
administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 include charges of $27 million related to: (i) the acceleration of

F-45


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

$17 million
of deferred compensation for restricted stock units and options that vested upon termination; and (ii) severance payments and other costs of approximately $10 million.

In
2012, the Company implemented a clawback policy that is retroactive to prior years pursuant to which its Board of Directors or Compensation Committee shall, in such circumstances as
they determine to be appropriate, require reimbursement or cancellation of all or a portion of any short or long-term cash or equity incentive awards or payments to an officer (or former officer, as
the case may be) of the Company where: (1) the amount of, or number of shares included in, any such payment or award was determined based on the achievement of financial results that were
subsequently the subject of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws; and (2) a lesser payment or award of cash or
shares would have been made to the individual based upon the restated financial results; and (3) the payment or award of cash or shares was received by the individual prior to or during the
12-month period following the first public issuance or filing of the financial results that were subsequently restated.

Total
share-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $40 million, $23 million and $20 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2013, there was $28 million of deferred compensation cost associated with future employee services, related to unvested share-based compensation
arrangements granted under the Company's incentive plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years.

Employee Benefit Plan

The Company maintains a 401(k) and profit sharing plan that allows for eligible participants to defer compensation, subject to certain
limitations imposed by the Code. The Company provides a matching contribution of up to 4% of each participant's eligible compensation. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company's matching contributions
were approximately $0.8 million for each year.

(17) Impairments

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company placed two medical office buildings into assets held for sale. As a result, the Company recognized
impairment charges of $1 million, which reduced the carrying value of the Company's aggregate investments from $7 million to the $6 million sales price. The fair value of the
Company's medical office buildings were based on the projected sales prices from the pending dispositions. The sales prices of the MOBs were considered to be a Level 2 measurement within the
fair value hierarchy.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company executed an agreement for the disposition of a land parcel in its life science segment. As a result of the planned disposition
of the land parcel, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $7.9 million, which reduced the carrying value of the Company's investment from $26 million to the $18 million
sales price. The fair value of the Company's land parcel was based on the projected sales prices from the pending disposition. The sales price of the land parcel was considered to be a Level 2
measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company concluded that its senior secured term loan to Delphis was impaired and established a provision for losses (impairment) of
$15 million. The impairment resulted from the Company's conclusion that the carrying value of its loan was in excess of the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral assets. This provision
for losses reduced the carrying value of its investment from $91 million to its fair value of $76 million. The fair value of the Company's loan investment was based on a discounted cash
flow valuation model and inputs considered to be a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Inputs to this valuation model include real estate

F-46


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

capitalization
rates, discount rates, earnings multiples, industry growth rates and operating margins, some of which influence the Company's expectation of future cash flows from the loan and,
accordingly, the fair value of its investment.

(18) Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $5.9 million as compared to an income tax benefit of
$1.6 million and an income tax expense of $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 respectively. The Company's income tax expense from discontinued operations
was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The Company's deferred income tax expense and its balance in deferred tax assets and liabilities were insignificant as of
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

The
Company files numerous U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax returns. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local tax
examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 2010.

At
December 31, 2013 and 2012, the tax basis of the Company's net assets is less than the reported amounts by $7.7 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively. The
difference between the reported amounts and the tax basis is primarily related to the Slough Estates USA, Inc. ("SEUSA") and HCR ManorCare acquisitions, which occurred in 2007 and 2011,
respectively. Both SEUSA and HCR ManorCare were corporations subject to federal and state income taxes. As a result of these acquisitions, the Company succeeded to the tax attributes of SEUSA and HCR
ManorCare, including the tax basis in the acquired companies' assets and liabilities. The Company generally will be subject to a corporate- level tax on any taxable disposition of SEUSA's
pre-acquisition assets that occur within ten years after its August 1, 2007 acquisition, and any taxable disposition of HCR ManorCare's pre-acquisition assets that occur within ten years after
its April 7, 2011 acquisition.

The
corporate-level tax associated with the disposition of assets acquired in connection with the SEUSA and HCR ManorCare acquisitions would be assessed only to the extent of the
built-in gain that existed on the date of each acquisition, based on the fair market value of the assets on August 1, 2007, with respect to SEUSA, and April 7, 2011, with respect to HCR
ManorCare. The Company does not expect to dispose of any assets included in either acquisition that would result in the imposition of a material tax liability. As a result, the Company has not
recorded a deferred tax liability associated with this corporate-level tax. Gains from asset dispositions occurring more than 10 years after either acquisition will not be subject to this
corporate-level tax. However, from time to time, the Company may dispose of SEUSA or HCR ManorCare assets before the applicable 10-year periods if it is able to effect a tax deferred exchange.

In
connection with the SEUSA and HCR ManorCare acquisitions, the Company assumed unrecognized tax benefits of $8 million and $2 million, respectively. During 2013, the
Company had a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $0.9 million. The decrease was caused by the lapse in the statute of limitations for unrecognized tax benefits assumed in connection with
the HCR ManorCare acquisition. During 2011, the Company had a net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $4.9 million. The decrease was caused by the reversal of the remaining
$6.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits related to the SEUSA acquisition caused by SEUSA's settlement of federal and state tax audits for all years for which the unrecognized tax benefits had
been accrued, net of a $2.0 million increase for unrecognized tax benefits assumed in connection with the HCR ManorCare acquisition. The unrecognized tax benefits balances at both
December 31, 2013 and 2012 were related entirely to the Company's acquisition of HCR ManorCare.

The
Company anticipates that the balance in unrecognized tax benefits will decrease over the next 12 months by approximately $0.9 million due to a lapse in the statute of
limitations.

For
the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded insignificant net increases to interest expense associated with the unrecognized tax benefits. For the year
ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded a net reduction to interest expense of $1.1 million. The net reduction was due to the reversal of $1.3 million of interest expense
associated with the SEUSA unrecognized tax benefits and an increase of $0.2 million associated with unrecognized tax benefits assumed in connection with the HCR ManorCare acquisition.

The
Company has agreements with the sellers of SEUSA and HCR ManorCare whereby any increases in taxes and associated interest and penalties related to years prior to each of these
acquisitions will be the responsibility of the sellers. Similarly, any pre-acquisition tax refunds and associated interest income will be refunded to the sellers.

There
would be no effect on the Company's tax rate if the unrecognized tax benefits were to be recognized.

Restricted
stock and certain of the Company's performance restricted stock units are considered participating securities, because dividend payments are not forfeited even if the
underlying award does not vest, which require the use of the two-class method when computing basic and diluted earnings per share.

Options
to purchase approximately 1.1 million, 1.2 million and 1.7 million shares of common stock that had an exercise price in excess of the average market price of
the common stock during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were not included because they are anti-dilutive.
Additionally, 6 million shares issuable upon conversion of 4 million DownREIT units during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were not included because they are
anti-dilutive.

(21) Variable Interest Entities

Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

At December 31, 2013, the Company leased 48 properties to a total of seven VIE tenants and has additional investments in a loan
and marketable debt securities to VIE borrowers. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.

The
Company holds an interest-only, senior secured term loan made to a borrower (Delphis Operations, L.P.) that has been identified as a VIE (see Note 7 for additional
information on the Delphis loan). The Company does not consolidate the VIE because it does not have the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance.
The loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the borrower (comprised primarily of interests in partnerships that operate surgical facilities, of which one partnership is a tenant of the
Company).

The
Company holds commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") issued by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation through a special purpose entity that has been identified as a VIE. The
Company does not consolidate the VIE because it does not have the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance. The CMBS issued by the VIE are backed
by mortgages on senior housing facilities.

Company's maximum loss exposure related to the VIE tenants represents the future minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the respective
leases, which may be mitigated by re-leasing the properties to new tenants. The Company's maximum loss exposure related to its loans and marketable debt securities to the VIE borrowers represents its
current aggregate carrying amount.

As
of December 31, 2013, the Company has not provided, and is not required to provide, financial support through a liquidity arrangement or otherwise, to its unconsolidated VIEs,
including circumstances in which it could be exposed to further losses (e.g., cash shortfalls). See Notes 6, 7 and 12 for additional descriptions of the nature, purpose and activities of
the Company's unconsolidated VIEs and interests therein.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

In September 2013, the Company made loans to two entities that entered into a tax credit structure ("Tax Credit Subsidiaries"). The
Company consolidates the Tax Credit Subsidiaries because they are VIEs and the Company is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. The assets and liabilities of the Tax Credit Subsidiaries substantially
consist of notes receivable, prepaid expenses, notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated from their operating activities. Assets generated by the operating activities of the
Tax Credit Subsidiaries may only be used to settle their contractual obligations.

In
September 2011, the Company formed a partnership in which it has a 90% ownership interest in a joint venture entity that owned and operated 21 properties in a RIDEA structure ("RIDEA
Entity"). The Company consolidated the RIDEA Entity as a result of the rights it acquired through the joint venture agreement with Brookdale. In the fourth quarter of 2012, upon the occurrence of a
reconsideration event, it was determined that this RIDEA Entity was a VIE and that the Company was the primary beneficiary of the VIE; therefore, the Company continued to consolidate this entity.
During the second quarter of 2013, upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event, it was determined that this RIDEA Entity was no longer a VIE; however, the Company continues to consolidate the RIDEA
Entity. The assets and liabilities of this RIDEA Entity substantially consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated from its
operating activities. The assets generated by the operating activities of the RIDEA Entity may be used to settle its contractual obligations, which include lease obligations to the Company. The
Company is entitled to its ownership share of the RIDEA Entity's assets; however, it does not guarantee its liabilities (or contractual obligations) and is not liable to its general creditors.

(23) Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair
value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair values of loans receivable, bank line of credit, term loan, mortgage debt and other debt are based on rates currently
prevailing for similar instruments with similar maturities. The fair values of interest-rate and currency swap contracts as well as common stock warrants are determined based on observable and
unobservable market assumptions using standardized pricing models. The fair values of senior unsecured notes and marketable equity and debt securities are determined utilizing market quotes.

Currency
swap contract (buy USD/sell GBP) hedges the foreign currency exchange risk related to a portion of the Company's forecasted interest receipts on
GBP denominated senior unsecured notes. Represents five foreign exchange contracts to sell £7.2 million at a rate of 1.5695 on various dates through June 2016.

The
Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations on specific forecasted transactions as well as recognized financial
obligations or assets. Utilizing derivative instruments allows the Company to manage the risk of fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates related to the potential impact these changes could
have on future earnings and forecasted cash flows. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

The
primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market and credit risk. Market risk is defined as the potential for loss in value of a derivative instrument due to adverse
changes in market prices. Utilizing derivative instruments allows the Company to manage the risk of fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates related to the potential impact these changes
could have on future earnings, forecasted cash flows and the fair value of recognized obligations.

Credit
risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation. The Company does not obtain collateral associated with its
derivative contracts, but monitors the credit standing of its counterparties on a regular basis. Should a counterparty fail to perform, the Company would incur a financial loss to the extent that the
associated derivative contract was in an asset position. At December 31, 2013, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties to its outstanding derivative contracts.

On
July 27, 2012, the Company entered into a foreign currency swap contract to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts
from its GBP denominated senior unsecured notes (see additional discussion of the Four Seasons senior unsecured notes in Note 10). The cash flow hedge has a fixed USD/GBP exchange rate of
1.5695 (buy $11 million and sell £7 million semi-annually) for a portion of its forecasted semi-annual cash receipts denominated in GBP. The foreign currency swap contract
matures in June 2016 (the end of the non-call period of the senior unsecured notes). The fair value of the contract at December 31, 2013 was a liability of $3 million and is included in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there was no ineffective portion related to this hedge.

On
July 27, 2012, the Company entered into an interest-rate swap contract that is designated as hedging the interest payments on its GBP denominated Term Loan due to fluctuations
in the underlying benchmark interest rate (see additional discussion of the Term Loan in Note 11). The cash flow hedge
has a notional amount of £137 million and expires in June 2016 (the maturity of the Term Loan). The fair value of the contract at December 31, 2013 was an asset of
$2 million and is included in other assets, net. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there was no ineffective portion related to this hedge.

For
the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company earned additional interest income of $0.1 million and recognized additional interest expense of $3 million,
resulting from its cash flow hedging relationships. At December 31, 2013, the Company expects that the hedged forecasted transactions for each of the outstanding qualifying cash flow hedging
relationships remain probable of occurring, and as a result, no gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified to earnings.

To
illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets, the Company performed a market sensitivity analysis on its outstanding hedging instruments. The
Company applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange

(25) Transactions with Related Parties

Mr. Klaritch, an executive vice president of the Company, was previously a senior executive and limited liability company member of MedCap
Properties, LLC, which was acquired in October 2003 by HCP and a joint venture of which HCP was the managing member. As part of that transaction, MedCap Properties, LLC contributed
certain property interests to a newly-formed entity, HCPI/Tennessee LLC, in exchange for DownREIT units. In connection with the transactions, Mr. Klaritch received 113,431 non-managing
member units in HCPI/Tennessee, LLC in a distribution of his interest in MedCap Properties, LLC. Each DownREIT unit is redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current
market value of two shares of HCP's common stock or, at HCP's option, two shares of HCP's common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications).
During the year ended December 31, 2012, Mr. Klaritch and his affiliates exchanged their remaining approximately 45,000 HCPI/Tennessee, LLC DownREIT units for approximately 90,000
shares of the Company's common stock.
