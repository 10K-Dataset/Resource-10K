ITEM 1.    Business

Business Overview

HCP, an S&P 500 company, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. We are a
self-administered, Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT") organized in 1985. We are headquartered in Long Beach, California, with offices in Chicago, Illinois; Nashville, Tennessee; and San
Francisco, California. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers. Our portfolio is comprised of investments in the
following five healthcare segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical office, (iv) hospital, and (v) skilled nursing. We make investments within our five healthcare segments
using the following five investment products: (i) properties under lease, (ii) investment management, (iii) developments, (iv) mezzanine loans, and (v) non-managing member
LLCs ("DownREITs").

The
delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that
the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the:

•

Compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services;

•

Specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and

•

Ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector.

Our
website address is

www.hcpi.com

. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any
amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable
after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish them to, the United States ("U.S.") Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Healthcare Industry

Healthcare is the single largest industry in the U.S. based on Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). According to the National Health
Expenditures report dated January 2009 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), the healthcare industry was projected to represent 17.6% of U.S. GDP in 2009.

Healthcare Expenditures Rising as a Percentage of GDP

(1)

Compound Annual Growth Rate ("CAGR").



Senior citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services. According to CMS, on a per capita basis, the 75-year and older segment of the
population spends 76% more on healthcare than the 65 to 74-year-old segment and over 200% more than the population average.

Business Strategy

Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on
three principles—opportunistic investing, portfolio diversification and conservative financing.

Opportunistic Investing

We make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value. We attempt to position
ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria.

Portfolio Diversification

We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment, geography, operator, tenant and investment
product. Diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business and allows us to take advantage of opportunities
in different markets based on individual market dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of diversification, we monitor, but do not limit, our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that
may be invested in any one property type, investment product, geographic location, the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant, or loans we may make to a single
borrower. With investments in multiple segments and investment products, we can focus on opportunities with the best risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole.

Conservative Financing

We believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach. We strive to
maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt-to-equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit, access to capital markets and
secured debt lenders and our ability to divest of assets. Our debt is primarily



fixed
rate, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations. Generally, we attempt to match the duration of our investments with fixed-rate financing.

We
may structure transactions as master leases, require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit or security
deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk. We finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of
credit or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing through offerings of securities, placement of mortgage debt and capital from other
institutional lenders and equity investors.

We
specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in Item 7, "2008 Transaction Overview," included elsewhere in this report.

Competition

Investing in real estate is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge
fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom have greater
resources and lower costs of capital than us. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to
compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and
regulations, new legislation and population trends.

Rental
income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels, including: the
quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price and range of services offered, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians,
staff, referral sources, location, the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area, and the financial condition of our tenants and operators. Private, federal and state payment
programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators. For a discussion of the risks associated with competitive
conditions affecting our business, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

Healthcare Property Types

Senior housing.

At December 31, 2008, we had interests in 264 senior housing facilities, including 25 facilities owned by our
Investment
Management Platform

(1)

. Senior housing facilities include independent living facilities ("ILFs"), assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and continuing care retirement communities
("CCRCs"), which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their needs. Services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents
directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Our senior housing property types are further described
below:

•

Independent Living Facilities.

ILFs are designed to meet
the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need assistance with
activities of daily living ("ADL"), such as bathing, eating and dressing. However, residents have the option to contract for these services. At December 31, 2008, we had interests in 49 ILFs.

•

Assisted Living Facilities.

ALFs are licensed care
facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with ADL yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social
activities, exercise and fitness programs,



beauty
or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These facilities are often in apartment-like
buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of
dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. At December 31, 2008, we had interests in 200 ALFs.

•

Continuing Care Retirement Communities.

CCRCs provide
housing and health-related services under long-term contracts. This alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change, thus allowing
residents to "age in place." Some CCRCs require a substantial entry or buy-in fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services. CCRCs
typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry. At December 31, 2008, we had interests in 15 CCRCs.

Our
senior housing segment accounted for approximately 34%, 40% and 38% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table
provides information about our senior housing operator concentration for the year ended December 31, 2008:

(1)

Investment
Management Platform represents the following joint ventures: (i) HCP Ventures II, (ii) HCP Ventures III, LLC, (iii) HCP Ventures IV, LLC, and
(iv) the HCP Life Science ventures.

(2)

Certain
of our properties are leased to tenants who have entered into management contracts with Sunrise to operate the respective property on their behalf.
To determine our concentration of revenues generated from properties operated by Sunrise, we aggregate revenue from these tenants with revenue generated from the two properties that are leased
directly to Sunrise. On December 1, 2008, we transitioned an 11-property portfolio to Emeritus Corporation that was previously operated by Sunrise. The percentage of segment revenues and total
revenues for Sunrise includes revenues from the transferred properties for the 11-month period preceding the transfer date.

In addition to the operator concentration above, HCP Ventures II, a 35% owned joint venture, leases 25 senior housing facilities to Horizon Bay
Retirement Living. During the year ended December 31, 2008, HCP Ventures II's rental and related revenues were $83.4 million.

Life science.

At December 31, 2008, we had interests in 104 life science properties, including eight facilities owned by our
Investment
Management Platform. These properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, scientific research institutions, government agencies and other
organizations involved in the life science industry. While these properties contain similar characteristics to commercial office buildings, they generally contain more advanced electrical, mechanical
and HVAC systems. The facilities generally have equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops, and related amenities. In many instances life science tenants make significant
investments to improve the space in addition to a landlord's improvement allowance to accommodate biology or chemistry research initiatives. Life science properties are primarily configured in
business park or campus settings and include multiple facilities and buildings. The business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible, contiguous/adjacent expansion that
accommodates the growth of existing tenants in place. Our properties are located in well established geographical markets known for scientific research, including San Francisco, San Diego and Salt
Lake City.



Our
life science segment accounted for approximately 24%, 11% and 4% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table
provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended December 31, 2008:

Medical office.

At December 31, 2008, we had interests in 251 medical office buildings ("MOBs"), including 63 facilities owned by
our
Investment Management Platform. These facilities typically contain physicians' offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services
such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings, they require more plumbing, electrical and
mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room, and special equipment such as x-ray machines. Our MOBs are typically multi-tenant properties leased to
multiple healthcare providers (hospitals and physician practices) and are primarily located on hospital campuses. Approximately 83% of our MOBs, based on square feet, are located on hospital campuses.

Our
medical office segment accounted for approximately 30%, 36% and 40% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the year ended
December 31, 2008, HCA, Inc. ("HCA"), as our tenant, contributed 15% of our medical office segment revenues.

Hospital.

At December 31, 2008, we had interests in 24 hospitals, including four facilities owned by our Investment Management
Platform.
Services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance and Health Maintenance Organizations ("HMOs")), or through the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our hospital property types include acute care, long-term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals. Our hospitals are all leased to single tenants or
operators under triple-net lease structures.

Our
hospital segment accounted for approximately 8%, 9% and 11% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table provides
information about our hospital operator/tenant concentration for the year ended December 31, 2008:

recognized income of $95 million from HCA during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Skilled nursing.

At December 31, 2008, we had interests in 51 skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"). SNFs offer restorative,
rehabilitative and
custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenues from sub-acute care services are derived from
providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic
therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain skilled nursing facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an out-patient basis. Skilled nursing services
provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for either



by
private sources or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. All of our SNFs are leased to single tenants under triple-net lease structures.

Our
skilled nursing segment accounted for approximately 4%, 4% and 7% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table
provides information about our skilled nursing operator/tenant concentration for the year ended December 31, 2008:

In addition to our investments in assets under leases, our skilled nursing segment also includes an investment in mezzanine loans to HCR
ManorCare. These loans have an aggregate face value of $1.0 billion, which we purchased, at a discount of approximately $100 million, as part of the financing for The Carlyle Group's $6.3 billion
purchase of HCR ManorCare. These loans bear interest on their face amounts at a floating rate of one-month LIBOR plus 4.0%, and mature in January 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we
earned approximately $84 million of interest income from these mezzanine loans.

Investment Products

Properties under lease.

At December 31, 2008, our investment in properties leased to third parties aggregated approximately $10
billion
representing 586 properties, including 30 properties accounted for as direct financing leases ("DFLs"). We primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under long-term leases. Most of our rents
and other earned income from leases are received under triple-net leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses. However, some of our medical office building ("MOBs")
and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such gross or modified gross leases, we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real
estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance.

Our
ability to grow rental income from properties under lease depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental
rates and occupancy levels, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries and (iii) control non-recoverable operating expenses. Most of our leases include annual base rent escalation clauses that are either
predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index.

Investment Management.

At December 31, 2008, our Investment Management Platform aggregated $2.0
billion in investments, representing 100 properties. We co-invest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as partnerships or limited liability
companies. We target institutional investors with long-term investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate. Predominantly, we retain minority interests in the
joint ventures ranging from 20% to 63% and serve as the managing member. These ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees, and have the potential for promoted interests
or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture.

Developments.

At December 31, 2008, our investment in properties under development, including redevelopment, or land held for
future
development, aggregated $577 million. We generally commit to development projects that are at least 50% pre-leased or when we believe that market conditions will support speculative construction. We
work closely with our local real estate service providers, including brokerage, property management, project management and construction management companies to



assist
us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments. Our development investments are primarily in our life science and medical office segments.

Mezzanine loans.

At December 31, 2008, our mezzanine loans and other debt investments aggregated $1.3 billion. Our mezzanine loans
are
generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities, which directly or indirectly own properties, and are subordinate to more senior debt, including mortgages and more senior
mezzanine loans. Our other debt investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities issued by healthcare providers and mortgages secured by healthcare real estate or real estate interests.

DownREITs.

Our DownREIT partnership structure enables us to acquire and hold real estate properties in an operating partnership. In
connection with
the formation of certain DownREIT partnerships, many partners contribute appreciated real estate to the DownREIT in exchange for DownREIT units that can be redeemed, or, at our election, exchanged at
some future date for shares of our stock. These contributions are generally tax-deferred, so that the pre-contribution gain related to the property is not taxed to the contributing partner. However,
if the contributed property is later sold by the partnership, the unamortized pre-contribution gain that exists at the date of sale is specially allocated and taxed to the contributing partners. Since
the formation of our first DownREIT partnership, we have acquired more than $1.0 billion of properties through DownREIT structures.

Portfolio Summary

At December 31, 2008, we managed $13.2 billion of investments owned in our Owned Portfolio and Investment Management Platform.
At December 31, 2008, we also owned $577 million of assets under development, including redevelopment, or land held for future development.

Employees of HCP

At December 31, 2008, we had 144 full-time employees, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

Taxation of HCP, Inc.

HCP, Inc. believes that it has operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1985, and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. No assurance can be given that HCP,
Inc. has operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified. For a description of the risks associated with HCP, Inc.'s REIT structure and the
related tax provisions governing HCP, Inc., see "Risk Factors—Tax and REIT-Related Risks" in Item 1A. of this report. This summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code
provisions, rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof.

If
HCP, Inc. qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of its net income that is currently distributed to
stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" (i.e., taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from investment in a corporation. However,
HCP, Inc. will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances.

The
Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association which meets the following statutory requirements: (i) it is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (ii) its
beneficial ownership is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) it would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856
through 860 of the Code; (iv) it is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) its beneficial ownership is held by 100 or more
persons; (vi) during the last half of each taxable year



not
more than 50% in value of its outstanding stock is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals; and (vii) it meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the amount of
its distributions and the nature of its income and assets. The Code provides that conditions (i) to (iv), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (v) must be met
during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. In addition, conditions (v) and (vi) do not apply in the first taxable
year for which an election to be treated as a REIT is effective.

At
the close of each taxable year, HCP, Inc. must meet two gross income requirements. First, for each taxable year, at least 75% of HCP, Inc.'s gross income (excluding gross income from
"prohibited transactions" (as defined below), certain hedging transactions entered into after July 30, 2008, and certain foreign currency gains recognized after July 30, 2008) must be derived directly
or indirectly from investments relating to real property, including rents from real property, or mortgages, certain mezzanine loans or from certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at
least 95% of HCP, Inc.'s gross income for each taxable year (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, certain hedging transactions, and certain foreign currency gains recognized after July
30, 2008) must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75% test and other dividends, interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities. A "prohibited transaction" is
a sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property) held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Under newly enacted legislation, after January 1, 2009, rents
received by HCP, Inc. from the lease of certain healthcare properties to its taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a "TRS" and collectively, "TRSs") may qualify as rents for purposes of the gross income
requirements if the property is operated on behalf of the TRS by a person that is an independent contractor and certain other requirements are met.

At
the close of each quarter of HCP, Inc.'s taxable year, it must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of its assets. First, at least 75% of the value of HCP, Inc.'s total
assets must be represented by real estate assets (including shares of stock of other REITs), cash, cash items, or government securities. For purposes of this test, the term "real estate assets"
generally means real property (including interests in real property and mortgages, and certain mezzanine loans) and shares in other REITs, as well as any stock or debt instrument attributable to the
investment of the proceeds of a stock offering
or a public debt offering with a term of at least five years, but only for the one-year period beginning on the date the proceeds are received. Second, not more than 25% of HCP, Inc.'s total assets
may be represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset class. Third, of the investments included in the 25% asset class and except for certain investments in other REITs, "qualified REIT
subsidiaries" and TRSs, the value of any one issuer's securities owned by HCP, Inc. may not exceed 5% of the value of HCP, Inc.'s total assets, and HCP, Inc. may not own more than 10% of the vote or
value of the securities of any one issuer. Solely for purposes of the 10% value test, however, certain securities including, but not limited to, securities having specified characteristics ("straight
debt"), loans to an individual or an estate, obligations to pay rents from real property and securities issued by a REIT, are disregarded as securities. Fourth, not more than 20% (25% for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2009) of the value of HCP, Inc.'s total assets may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs.

HCP,
Inc., directly and indirectly, owns interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a
limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the Code, for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the
partnership or limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of gross income of the partnership or limited liability company, in each case, determined in
accordance with the REIT's capital interest in the entity (subject to special rules related to the 10% asset test). The ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a REIT
may involve special tax risks,



including
the challenge by the Internal Revenue Service of the allocations of income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company, which would affect the computation of taxable
income of the REIT, and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership (as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation) for federal income tax
purposes

.

HCP,
Inc. also owns interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries ("QRS"). A corporation will qualify as a qualified REIT
subsidiary of HCP, Inc. if HCP, Inc. owns 100% of the outstanding stock of the corporation directly or through other disregarded entities, and HCP, Inc. does not elect with the subsidiary to treat it
as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," (or "TRS"), as described below. A QRS is not treated as a separate corporation for federal income tax purposes and all assets, liabilities and items of income,
deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as the assets, liabilities and such items of HCP, Inc. for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests. If any partnership, limited liability
company or QRS in which HCP, Inc. owns an interest were treated as a corporation (other than a TRS or a REIT) for federal income tax purposes, HCP, Inc. could fail to satisfy the REIT income and asset
tests described above and could therefore fail to qualify as a REIT, unless certain relief provisions apply. Except with respect to certain entities in which HCP, Inc. owns less than a 10% interest,
HCP, Inc. believes that each of the partnerships, limited liability companies and subsidiaries (other than TRSs), in which it owns an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership,
disregarded entity (in the case of a 100% owned partnership or limited liability company), REIT or QRS, as applicable, although no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service will not
successfully challenge the status of any such entity.

As
of December 31, 2008, HCP, Inc. and HCP Life Science REIT, Inc. ("HCP Life Science REIT") owned interests in 13 subsidiaries which have elected to be TRSs. A REIT may own any
percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the REIT to be a TRS, provided certain requirements are met. A TRS generally may engage in any
business, including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent REIT and of others, except a TRS may not directly or indirectly manage or operate a lodging or
healthcare facility or directly or indirectly provide to any other person (under a franchise, license or otherwise) rights to any brand name under which any lodging or health care facility is
operated. A TRS is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income taxes at regular corporate rates. In addition, a 100% tax may be imposed on a REIT
if the arrangement between the REIT or its tenants and its TRS are not on arm's length terms and, as a result, the REIT's rents or other income or the TRS's deductions are overstated.

In
order to qualify as a REIT, HCP, Inc. is required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to its stockholders in an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90%
of its "real estate investment trust taxable income" (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net income, if any (after tax), from
foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. Such distributions must be paid, or treated as paid, in the taxable year to which they relate. At HCP, Inc.'s
election, a distribution will be treated as paid in a taxable year if it is declared before HCP, Inc. timely files its tax return for such year and is paid on or before the first regular dividend
payment after such declaration, provided such payment is made during the twelve-month period following the close of such year. To the extent that HCP, Inc. does not distribute all of its net capital
gain or distributes at least 90%, but less than 100%, of its "real estate investment trust taxable income," as adjusted, HCP, Inc. will be required to pay tax on the undistributed amount at regular
corporate tax rates. Furthermore, if HCP, Inc. fails to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of its ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of its capital gain net income
for such year and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, HCP, Inc. would be required to pay a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually
distributed. While historically HCP, Inc. has satisfied the distribution requirements



discussed
above by making cash distributions to its shareholders, a REIT is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited
circumstances, its own stock. For distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2009, recent Internal Revenue Service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90% of the
distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of HCP, Inc. common stock, if certain conditions are met.

On
July 27, 2007, we formed HCP Life Science REIT, Inc. ("HCP Life Science REIT") which elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code commencing with its
initial taxable year ended December 31, 2007. We believe that HCP Life Science REIT has operated in such a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code commencing with its initial
taxable year and HCP Life Science REIT intends to continue to operate in such a manner. Provided that HCP Life Science REIT qualifies as a REIT, HCP, Inc.'s interest in HCP Life Science REIT is
treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset requirements and any dividend income or gains derived by HCP, Inc. from the stock of HCP Life Science REIT is generally treated
as income
that qualifies for purposes of the REIT income requirements. To qualify as a REIT, HCP Life Science REIT must independently satisfy the various REIT qualification requirements, including distributions
of REIT taxable income. If HCP Life Science REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to federal income tax. In
addition, a failure of HCP Life Science REIT to qualify as a REIT could have an adverse effect on HCP, Inc.'s ability to comply with the REIT asset and income requirements described above, and thus
its ability to qualify as a REIT.

If
HCP, Inc. or HCP Life Science REIT fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and certain relief provisions do not apply, the applicable REIT will be required to pay
tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Dividend distributions to stockholders in any year in which it fails to qualify will not be
deductible by the applicable REIT nor will such distributions be required to be made. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, the applicable REIT will also be disqualified from
taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. Failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to stockholders and
could result in us incurring substantial indebtedness (to the extent borrowings are feasible) or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes.

In
addition to federal income taxes, HCP, Inc. and HCP Life Science REIT may be required to pay state and local taxes in various jurisdictions.

HCP,
Inc. and HCP Life Science REIT may also be subject to certain other taxes applicable to REITs, including taxes in lieu of disqualification as a REIT, on undistributed income, on
income from prohibited transactions, on net income from foreclosure property and on built-in gains from the sale of certain assets acquired from C corporations in tax-free transactions (including the
assets of Slough Estates USA Inc. ("SEUSA") held by HCP Life Science REIT) during a specified time period.

Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement

Overview

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations
relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities. These regulations are wide-ranging
and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving
regulatory regime because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the



laws
may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a
significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

We
seek to mitigate the risk to us resulting from the significant healthcare regulatory risks faced by our tenants and operators by diversifying our portfolio among property types and
geographical areas, diversifying our tenant and operator base to limit our exposure to any single entity, and seeking tenants and operators who are not primarily dependent on Medicare or Medicaid
reimbursement for their revenues. As of December 31, 2008, our investments in the senior housing, life science, medical office, skilled nursing and hospital segments represented approximately 36%,
28%, 18%, 10% and 8% of our portfolio, respectively, based on investment amount. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we estimate that approximately 8% and 24% of our tenants' and operators' revenues
were derived from Medicare and Medicaid, respectively, based on information provided by our tenants and operators.

The
following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases, to us, as well as descriptions of some of the specific risks to
which different types of our tenants and operators are subject.

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers' relationships and
arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing
false claims or making false statements to
receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid
anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral
laws (commonly referred to as the "Stark Law"), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv)
the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claims for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state
privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1997, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health
information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can
also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring

qui tam

or "whistleblower" actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to
comply with applicable laws. A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could negatively impact our tenants' and operators' liquidity, financial condition and
results of operations, which could negatively impact their ability to make payments under their agreements with us, or otherwise comply with the terms of such agreements.

Reimbursement

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among other sources, governmental healthcare programs, such as the
federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare
reform initiatives, and as many



states
face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by
some of our tenants and operators. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants or operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue
to participate in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need

Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and
inspection laws and regulations. Many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a "certificate of need," which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion and closure of
certain healthcare facilities. Further, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Failure to comply with
any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or
closure of the facility. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants' and operators' abilities to expand or change their businesses. Failure to comply
with these laws or to obtain required certificates of need may have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the tenants and operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us,
and therefore may adversely impact us.

Life Science Facilities

While certain of our life science tenants include some well-established companies, other such tenants are less established and, in some
cases, may not yet have a product approved by the Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale. Creating a new pharmaceutical product requires significant
investments of time and money, in part, because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry; it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and
effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance. Further, even after a life science company has gained regulatory approval to market a product, the product still presents regulatory
risks. Such risks may include, among others, the possible later discovery of safety concerns, changes in reimbursement policies for the product, competition from new products, litigation over the
validity or infringement of the underlying intellectual property, and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product. All these factors may have an adverse effect on the operations and
financial condition of our life science tenants and therefore may adversely impact us.

Senior Housing Entrance Fee Communities

Certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance
fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form of long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities are subject to
significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility's financial condition, establishment and monitoring of
reserve requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change
of ownership and similar matters. Such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants
and operators and therefore may adversely impact us.



Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA")

Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are "public
accommodations" as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily
achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by
persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance
with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an ongoing one, and we
continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.

Environmental Matters

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare
facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve myriad regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of
these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as
us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to
hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property
damages and the owner's or secured lender's liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such
substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as
collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. For a description of the risks associated with environmental matters, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

Before deciding whether to invest in HCP, you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as
the risks described elsewhere in this report, which risks are incorporated by reference into this section. The risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be
additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely to have a significant impact on us. All of these risks could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

As
the owner of healthcare and other real estate facilities, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Certain of these risks and uncertainties are associated directly with
the business of owning and leasing real estate generally, but others are associated with our specific business model or other attributes of HCP. For example, as described elsewhere in this report,
most of our properties are operated by and/or leased to third parties. Accordingly, adverse developments with respect to these third parties may materially adversely affect us. In addition, we operate
in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a REIT, which involves the application of highly technical and complex laws and regulations. We believe that the risks facing our company generally fall
into the following four categories:

•

Risks related to HCP

•

Risks related to our operators and tenants



•

Risks related to tax matters including REIT-related risks

•

Risks related to our organizational structure

Risks Related to HCP

The recent market disruptions may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

The global financial markets are currently undergoing pervasive and fundamental disruptions. The continuation or intensification of any
such volatility may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Among other things, the capital markets have recently experienced extreme pricing volatility,
dislocations and liquidity disruptions, all of which have exerted downward pressure on stock prices, widened credit spreads on prospective debt financing and led to unprecedented declines in the
market values of U.S. and foreign stock exchanges. The recent dislocations in the debt markets have reduced the amount of capital that is available to finance real estate, which, in turn, has led to
reduced property values and caused an overall slowdown of real estate transaction activity, all of which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

The
current U.S. and global economic and financial crisis has also severely strained the credit markets resulting in the bankruptcies and mergers of large financial institutions and
significant investment in and control by government bodies of financial institutions to avoid further illiquidity and bank failures. At times, certain segments of the credit market have frozen with
banks no longer willing to make loans. The continuation or intensification of current levels of market disruption and volatility could impact our ability to obtain new financing or refinance our
existing debt as it becomes due.

The
recent volatility may also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation, or in the stability of the value, of our investments and those of our joint ventures, that could result
in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures. As a result, we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated
goodwill, if any, which may require us to recognize an impairment charge in earnings. Additionally, certain fees we generate from our joint ventures are dependent upon the value of the investments
held by such joint ventures or the level of contributions we make to the property fund. If property values or our level of contributions decrease, certain fees generated by our joint ventures may also
decrease.

We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is limited or on unfavorable terms, we may not be able to meet
commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business.

In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we are generally required, among other things,
to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our "real estate investment trust taxable income" (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains). For
distributions with respect to the taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2009, recent Internal Revenue Service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90% of this requirement through the
distribution of shares of HCP, Inc. common stock, if certain conditions are met. We may not be able to fund, from cash retained from operations, all future capital needs, including capital needs in
connection with acquisitions and development activities. If we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources, we might not be able to make the investments
needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. As a result, we rely on external sources of capital, including debt and equity financing, to fulfill our capital
requirements. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including:

•

further weakening of the U.S. and global economies and the possibility of a prolonged recession;



•

general availability of credit and market conditions, including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost;

•

the market price of the shares of our equity securities;

•

the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions;

•

the ratings of our debt and preferred securities;

•

our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility;

•

financial deterioration of our lenders that might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their
willingness to make additional loans to us, and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms, or at all;

•

the stability in the market value of our properties;

•

the value of our mezzanine loans and other debt investments;

•

the financial performance of our operators, tenants and borrowers;

•

issues facing the healthcare industry, including regulations and government reimbursement policies;

•

changes in rules or practices governing our financial and SEC reporting; and

•

civil disturbances, natural disasters or acts of war.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and preferred stock financing on favorable terms, if at all, and significantly
reduce the market price of our securities, including our common stock.

We currently have a credit rating of Baa3 (stable) from Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's"), BBB (stable) from Standard & Poor's
Ratings Service ("S&P") and BBB (positive) from Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") on our senior unsecured debt securities, and Ba1 (stable) from Moody's, BB+ (stable) from S&P and BBB- (positive) from Fitch on
our preferred equity securities. The credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt and preferred equity securities are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall
financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the
terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate, we would
likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings
would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. Because we depend on external sources of capital to fund
our acquisition and development activities, adverse changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact our acquisition and development activities, future growth opportunities, financial condition
and the market price of our securities.

Our level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect us in many ways, including reducing funds available for other business purposes and reducing our operational
flexibility.

Our indebtedness as of December 31, 2008 was approximately $5.9 billion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including
in connection with the development or acquisition of assets, which may be substantial. Any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and preferred
equity securities and require a substantial portion of our cash



flow
to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, conduct development activities, make
capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us
more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels. Increased future debt
service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed. Further,
if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or
transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition and ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred equity securities.

Covenants in our existing and future credit agreements and other debt instruments limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach or a default could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness, including additional credit agreements or amendments we may enter into and
other indebtedness we may incur in the future, require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios
and tangible net worth requirements. Our continued ability to incur indebtedness and operate in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants, which limit our operational
flexibility. For example, mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability, without the consent of the lender, to further encumber or sell the
applicable properties, or to replace the applicable tenant or operator. Breaches of such covenants may result in defaults under certain mortgages on our properties, even if we satisfy our payment
obligations to the respective lender. Defaults under the mortgages, including certain tenant or operator bankruptcies and other lease defaults may result in cross-defaults under and acceleration of
certain of our other indebtedness. Covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on existing variable rate debt and new debt, and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing
debt, sell assets and limit our acquisition and development activities.

At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $892 million of variable interest rate indebtedness, which constitutes 15% of our overall
indebtedness. This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.57% per annum. We may incur more variable interest rate indebtedness in the future. If interest rates
increase, so will our interest costs for our existing variable interest rate debt and any new debt. This increased cost could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, decrease our
ability to pay principal and interest on our debt, decrease our ability to make distributions to our security holders and make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly.
Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced
indebtedness. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in
response to changes in economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2008, our exposure to variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by $1.1 billion of variable rate investments.



Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

From time to time, we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. See "Legal Proceedings" in
Part I, Item 3 in this report for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of actions of our operators
and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their
respective businesses. See "Risks Related to Our Operators and Tenants—

Our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and rising liability and insurance costs
that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments

." An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and operations. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental
matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations.

A small number of operators and tenants, some of whom are experiencing significant legal, financial and regulatory difficulties, account for a large percentage of our
revenues.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 37% of our portfolio, based on our total revenues, was operated or leased by
five companies, consisting of Sunrise (15%), HCA (7%), Brookdale (7%), Genentech (4%) and Tenet (4%). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we earned interest of $84 million and $24
million in connection with mezzanine loans to HCR ManorCare and marketable debt securities issued by HCA, respectively. Certain of these companies are experiencing significant legal, financial and
regulatory difficulties. Among other things, Sunrise has disclosed that it does not anticipate being in compliance with certain financial covenants in its bank credit facility as of March 31, 2009,
which could result in an acceleration of the debt under that facility. In addition, several of these major operators and tenants have significant debt and lease obligations and have been affected by
the recent economic downturn, which has led to, in some instances, a precipitous decline in their stock price. The failure or inability of any of these operators or tenants to meet their obligations
to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations, which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay, cause our stock price to decline and have other material
adverse effects. See "Risks Related to Our Operators and Tenants—

The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or
tenants may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

" for additional information on the risks we face from a failure of one or
more of our operators or tenants.

We have investments in mezzanine loans, which are subject to a greater risk of loss than loans secured by the underlying real estate.

At December 31, 2008, we had mezzanine loan investments with a carrying value of $918 million. Our mezzanine loans generally take the
form of subordinated loans secured by a pledge of ownership interests in either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests in the entity that owns, directly or through other
entities, the interest in the entities owning the properties. These types of investments involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage loans secured by income producing real property
because the investment may have a lesser likelihood of being repaid in full as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its
ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to fully repay our mezzanine loans. If a borrower
defaults on our mezzanine loans or debt senior to our loans, or in the event of a borrower



bankruptcy,
our mezzanine loans will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid and consistent with bankruptcy rules. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our investment. In addition,
mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. If our mezzanine loans are
not
repaid, or are only partially repaid, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be
unable to successfully operate or occupy the underlying real estate, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.

If an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our
interest by acquiring title to the collateral. In some cases, as noted above, the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property
and, accordingly, we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity. In addition, if we acquire real estate as a result of a foreclosure, we may be required to make substantial improvements or
repairs in order to maximize the facility's investment potential. Operators, tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our
exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. Foreclosure-related costs, high "loan-to-value" ratios or
declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure. Even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral
securing our real estate-related loans, we may inherit properties for which we are unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators, if at all, which would adversely affect our ability to fully
recover our investment.

Credit enhancements to our leases may terminate or be inadequate, or the provider of a credit enhancement may be unable to fulfill its payment obligations to us, any of
which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Some of our leases have credit enhancement provisions in the form of guarantees or security deposits, for minimum rent payments payable
to us. These credit enhancement provisions may terminate at either a specific time during the lease term or once the property satisfies defined operating hurdles like net operating income. These
provisions may also have limits on the overall amount of the credit enhancement. After the termination of a credit enhancement, or in the event that the maximum limit of a credit enhancement is
reached, we may only look to the tenant or operator to make lease payments. Some of our tenants are thinly capitalized entities that rely on the results of operations generated by the properties to
fund rent obligations under their lease. In the event that a credit enhancement has expired or the maximum limit has been reached, or in the event that a provider of a credit enhancement is unable to
meet its payment obligations, our results of operations and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected if our properties are unable to generate sufficient funds from
operations to meet minimum rent payments and the tenants or operators do not otherwise have the resources to make those rent payments.

Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities.

Transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals, including change of
ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements, that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real
estate. The replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal, state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the
replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. If we are



unable
to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms, or at all, we may take possession of a facility, which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify
subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and operations.

We may not be able to sell properties when we desire because real estate investments are relatively illiquid.

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In addition, some of our properties serve as collateral for our secured debt
obligations and cannot be readily sold. We may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in the real estate market. This inability to respond to changes in the performance of
our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular our ability to service our debt and pay dividends on our common and preferred
stock. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:

•

adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions;

•

changes in interest rates and in the availability, costs and terms of financing;

•

leases or management agreements which are not renewed or are renewed at lower payment amounts at expiration;

•

the exercise of purchase options by operators or tenants resulting in a reduction of our revenues;

•

changes in laws, regulations, fiscal policies, zoning and other ordinances;

•

the costs of complying with existing and new laws and regulations;

•

the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures and the need to make expenditures due to
changes in governmental regulations, including the ADA;

•

environmental hazards created by prior owners or occupants, existing operators or tenants, borrowers or other persons for
which we may be liable;

•

changes in operating expenses; and

•

acts of terrorism, civil unrest, acts of war and natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, which may result in
uninsured and underinsured losses.

We
cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to
us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property or portfolio of properties. In addition, there are provisions under the federal
income tax laws
applicable to REITs that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse
changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Real estate is a competitive business and this competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase, or develop, suitable healthcare and other facilities, to grow our
operations through these activities or to successfully reinvest proceeds.

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Part of our business strategy is growing through acquisitions, which requires us to
identify suitable candidates that meet our acquisition criteria. However, when we attempt to develop, finance or acquire properties, we face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private
equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom have greater resources



and
lower costs of capital than us. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals. Among other things,
from time to time, we have cash proceeds available to us from securities offerings, asset sales, joint venture or other activities, in which competition can negatively affect our ability to reinvest
these proceeds on a timely basis. If we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline, identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices, or reinvest proceeds on
a timely basis, or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

Because of the unique and specific improvements required for healthcare facilities, we may be required to incur substantial development and renovation costs to make certain
of our properties suitable for other operators and tenants, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related
uses. The improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, are costly and often times
tenant-specific. A new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property, depending on that operator's or tenant's particular operations. If a current operator
or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant. Also, if the property needs
to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants, we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to re-lease the space. These
expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not at all and, under certain circumstances, prevent completion of
development activities once undertaken, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Large-scale, ground-up development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us, including risks
that:

•

a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or
failure to recover expenses already incurred;

•

the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and
higher materials, transportation, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make the completion of the development project less profitable;

•

construction and/or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;

•

the project may not be completed on schedule, which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service
expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including: natural disasters, labor conditions, material shortages, regulatory hurdles, civil unrest and acts of war; and

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the
property profitable.

Properties
developed or acquired for development likely generate little or no cash flow from the date of acquisition through the date of completion of development. In addition, new
development activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful, may require a substantial portion of our management's time and attention.



These
risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and thus our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to
stockholders.

Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We intend to develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of
these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that:

•

we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority,
which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes;

•

our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including
the timing, terms and strategies for any investments;

•

our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to
fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and

•

our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.

From time to time, we acquire other companies and need to integrate them into our existing business. If we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired
companies or they fail to perform as expected, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

Acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. Successful integration of the operations
of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We cannot assure you that we will
be able to integrate the operations of the companies that we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, without encountering difficulties. Potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include
the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies and the assumption of
unexpected liabilities. Estimated cost savings in connection with acquisitions are typically projected to come from various areas that our management identifies through the due diligence and
integration planning process; yet, our target companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected. Inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly
optimistic estimates of future revenues. Similarly, we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or
market position. If we have difficulties with any of these areas, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies, we might not achieve
the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions, and this may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
stock price.

Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over
financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of



such
control. Changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or
overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we
fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business,
results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.

Loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us.

We are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers. Although our chief executive officer has an employment agreement with us, we
cannot assure you that he will remain employed with us. The loss or limited availability of the services of our chief executive officer or any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit
and retain qualified personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

We may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property or decrease anticipated
future revenues.

We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are
adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake, windstorm and flood and may be
subject to other losses. In particular, our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity. While we purchase insurance for earthquake, windstorm and flood
that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses. These losses can
decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property. The insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile
and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future. In addition, there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not
believe it is economically feasible to do so.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments.

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or previous owner of real estate, we may be
required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous substances released at a property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation
and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages
and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Although we (i) currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe
are commercially reasonable, and (ii) generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, such liabilities could exceed the amount
of our insurance, the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may
adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. As the owner of a site, we may also be liable under common law to third parties for



damages
and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. We may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us.

Risks Related to Our Operators and Tenants

The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

We lease our properties directly to operators in most cases, and in certain other cases, we lease to third-party tenants who enter into
long-term management agreements with operators to manage the properties. Although our leases, financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide
us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict an operator or tenant, or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a
party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies. For example, we cannot evict
a tenant or operator solely
because of its bankruptcy filing. A debtor has the right to assume, or to assume and assign to a third party, or reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding. If a debtor were to reject
its leases with us, our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may be substantially less than the
remaining rent actually owed under the lease. In addition, the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with
certain covenants contained in the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators. Moreover, certain tenant or operator bankruptcies or other lease defaults may result in
defaults under the mortgages on the relevant properties and cross-defaults under and acceleration of our other indebtedness. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the
applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs, such default may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, delays in the availability of funding or
other material adverse consequences.

Many
of our operating leases also contain non-contingent rent escalators for which we recognize income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This method
results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received, creating a straight-line rent receivable asset included in the caption "Other assets, net" on
our consolidated balance sheets. At some point during the lease, depending on its terms, the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straight-line rent which results in the
straight-line rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term. We assess the collectibility of the straight-line rent that is expected to be
collected in a future period, and, depending on circumstances, we may provide a reserve against the previously recognized straight-line rent receivable asset for a portion, up to its full
value, that we estimate may not be recoverable. In addition, upon acquisition of a leased property that we account for as an operating lease, we may record lease-related intangible assets,
to the extent the purchase price for the asset exceeds its fair market value. The balance of straight-line rent receivable at December 31, 2008, net of allowances was $112 million.
We had approximately $465 million of lease-related intangible assets, net of amortization, and $231 million of lease-related intangible liabilities, net of
amortization, associated with our operating leases at December 31, 2008. To the extent any of the operators or tenants for our properties, for the reasons discussed above, become unable to pay
amounts due, we may be required to write down the straight-line rents receivable or lease intangibles or may impair the related carrying value of leased properties.

The current U.S. housing and strained credit markets may adversely affect our operators' and tenants' ability to increase or maintain occupancy levels at, and rental income
from, our senior housing facilities.

Our tenants and operators may have relatively flat or declining occupancy levels in the near-term due to falling home prices, declining
incomes, stagnant home sales and other economic factors. Seniors



may
choose to postpone their plans to move into senior housing facilities rather than sell their homes at a loss, or for a profit below their expectations. Moreover, tightening lending standards and
the strained credit market have made it more difficult for potential buyers to obtain mortgage financing, all of which have contributed to the declining home sales. In addition, the senior housing
segment may experience a decline in occupancy associated with private pay residents choosing to move out of the facilities to be cared for at home by relatives due to the weakening economy. A material
decline in our tenants' and operators' occupancy levels and revenues may make it more difficult for them to meet their financial obligations to us, which could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, licensing and certification
requirements, fraud and abuse regulations or new legislative developments may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us.

Our operators and tenants are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and
substantial changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. The ultimate
timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted. These changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators' and tenants' costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by both
government and other third-party payors. The failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws, requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet
their financial and contractual obligations to us. Regulations that affect our operators and tenants include the following:

•

Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations.

There are various
extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers' relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws
include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or
other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid
anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state
physician self-referral laws, including the Stark Law, which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial
relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claims for certain healthcare services and
(v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1997, which provide for the privacy and
security of personal health information.

Furthermore,
violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws can carry substantial civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions, including potential exclusion or debarment from Medicare, Medicaid or
other federal or state health care programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things,
federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring

qui tam

or "whistleblower" actions.

•

Medicare and Medicaid.

During 2008, our skilled nursing
segment accounted for approximately 4% of our revenues. A portion of our skilled nursing operators' revenues is derived from governmentally-funded reimbursement programs, primarily
Medicare and Medicaid, and are consequently subject to the potential adverse effects of decreased reimbursement rates in these programs. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform
initiatives, and as many



states
face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by
some of our tenants and operators. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants or operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue
to participate in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs could cause the revenues of our operators and
borrowers to decline, potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us causing the value of our affected properties or investments to decline.

State
licensing and Medicare and Medicaid laws also require operators of nursing homes and ALFs to comply with extensive standards governing operations. Federal and state agencies administering those
laws regularly inspect such facilities and investigate complaints. Our operators, borrowers and their managers receive notices of potential sanctions and remedies from time to time, and such sanctions
have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them. If they are unable to cure deficiencies, sanctions may be imposed that reduce our operators' and borrowers' revenues or cause them
to cease operations, thereby potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us.

•

Licensing and Certification.

Certain healthcare
facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure, certification, and inspection laws and regulations. These facilities are audited periodically by federal,
state, and local authorities to confirm compliance. Further, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials, and operate equipment.
Finally, many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a "certificate of need" prior to the construction, expansion, or closure of certain healthcare facilities. Our skilled nursing
facilities in particular tend to require certificates of need prior to the addition or construction of new beds, the addition of services, or certain capital expenditures. Some of our facilities may
be unable to satisfy current and future certificate of need requirements and may for this reason be unable to continue operating in the future. In such event, our revenues from those facilities could
be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently. Furthermore, failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition
of fines, suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or closure of the facility.

•

Legislative and Regulatory Developments.

Each year,
legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. We cannot
accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and, thus, our business.

Increased competition as well as increased operating costs have resulted in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet
their financial and other contractual obligations to us.

The healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future. The occupancy levels at, and rental income
from, our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources. These entities compete with other operators and tenants
on a number of different levels, including: the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for
healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location, and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area. Private, federal and
state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators. Our operators and tenants also



compete
with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement
communities and convalescent centers. Such competition, which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest, has caused the fill-up rate of newly constructed
buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease. We cannot be certain that the operators and tenants
of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Further, many competing companies may have resources and
attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants. Thus, our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract
residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability meet their financial and other contractual obligation to us, potentially decreasing our revenues and
increasing our collection and dispute costs.

Our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses.

Our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that
covers us, as well as the tenants and operators. Some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur,
we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless
remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators. However, we cannot assure
you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future.

Our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and rising liability and insurance costs that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments.

In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought
litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities. Also, in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses. The
effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition,
their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be very significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues. Cost increases could cause our
operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance, potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our
collection and litigation costs. Moreover, to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities from our operators and tenants, our revenues from those facilities could be reduced or
eliminated for an extended period of time. In addition, as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our
operators or tenants, which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part.

Our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to make payments to us and,
consequently, materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Life science tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique
risks, as follows:

•

some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research, development and clinical testing of their
products and technologies. If private investors, the government or other



sources
of funding are unavailable to support such activities, a tenant's business may be adversely affected or fail.

•

the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal,
state and foreign regulatory approvals. The approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. Even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may
fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, some tenants may only have a small number of products under development. If one product fails to receive the
required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly adversely affect our tenant's entire business and its ability to make payments to us.

•

even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, the product still presents regulatory
and liability risks. Such risks may include, among others, the possible later discovery of safety concerns, competition from new products, and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the
product. These factors may have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our life science tenants and therefore may adversely impact us.

•

our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform efforts and the reimbursement policies
of government or private healthcare payors.

•

our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws.
Failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition.

We
cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses. If our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to
us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Tax and REIT-Related Risks

Loss of HCP, Inc.'s tax status as a REIT would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences to us.

HCP, Inc. currently operates and has operated commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1985 in a manner that
is intended to allow it to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Code. In addition, as described below, we own the stock of HCP Life Science REIT which elected to be
treated as a REIT commencing with its initial taxable year ended December 31, 2007.

Qualification
as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The
determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect the ability of HCP, Inc. and HCP Life Science REIT to qualify as REITs. If
HCP Life Science REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, HCP, Inc. also would fail to qualify as a REIT unless HCP, Inc. (or HCP Life Science REIT) could make use of
certain relief provisions provided under the Code. To qualify as REITs, HCP, Inc. and HCP Life Science REIT must each satisfy a number of organizational, operational, stockholder
ownership, dividend distribution, asset, income and other requirements. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of HCP, Inc.'s gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying
sources, and HCP, Inc. must make distributions to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In addition, new legislation,
treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors if such future events affected HCP, Inc.'s ability to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes.
Although we believe that HCP, Inc. and HCP Life Science REIT have been organized and have operated in such manner, we can give no assurance that HCP, Inc. or HCP Life
Science REIT have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes.



If HCP, Inc. loses its REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal
and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders. If HCP, Inc. fails to qualify as a REIT:

•

it would not be allowed an income tax deduction for dividends distributed to stockholders and would be subject to federal
and state income tax at regular corporate rates or alternative minimum tax rates;

•

it could also be subject to increased local income taxes; and

•

unless HCP, Inc. is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, it could not elect to be subject to tax as a
REIT for four taxable years following the year for which it was disqualified.

In
addition, if HCP, Inc. fails to qualify as a REIT, it would not be required to make distributions to stockholders; however, all distributions to stockholders would be subject
to tax as qualifying corporate dividends to the extent of HCP, Inc.'s current and accumulated earnings and profits.

As
a result of all these factors, HCP, Inc.'s failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could materially adversely
affect the value of our common stock.

Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of
properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since
we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are properly treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is
held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain
transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Service were
to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain from the prohibited transaction.
In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.

To qualify as a REIT, each year we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our "real estate investment trust taxable
income" (computed without regard to our dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain). If we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any year, we will be subject to regular
corporate income taxes. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary
income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. For distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2009, recent
Internal Revenue Service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90% of these requirements through the distribution of shares of HCP, Inc. common stock, if certain conditions are met. To maintain
our REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the
then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of
cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax



purposes,
or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt principal payments.

As a result of the acquisition of SEUSA, HCP Life Science REIT may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from SEUSA.

HCP Life Science REIT is the successor to the tax attributes, including tax basis, and earnings and profits, if any, of SEUSA.
If HCP Life Science REIT recognizes gain on the disposition of any properties formerly owned by SEUSA during the ten-year period beginning on the date on which it acquired the
SEUSA stock, it will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on such gain to the extent of the excess of (a) the fair market value of the asset over (b) its adjusted
basis in the asset, in each case determined as of the date on which it acquired the SEUSA stock. Any taxes paid by HCP Life Science REIT would reduce the amount available for distribution by
HCP Life Science REIT to us.

As a result of the CRP merger and the CRC merger, we may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from CRP and CRC.

In connection with the CRP merger, CRP's REIT counsel rendered an opinion to us, dated as of the closing date of the merger,
substantially to the effect that on the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions, CRP qualified as a REIT under the Code for the taxable years
ending December 31, 1999 through the closing date of the merger. If, however, contrary to the opinion of CRP's REIT counsel, CRP failed to qualify as a REIT for any of its taxable years, it
would be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Because the CRP merger was treated for income tax
purposes as if CRP sold all of its assets in a taxable transaction to HCP, Inc., if CRP did not qualify as a REIT for the taxable year of the merger, it would be subject to tax on the excess of
the fair market value of its assets over their adjusted tax basis. As a successor in interest to CRP, HCP, Inc. would be required to pay this tax.

As
a result of the CRC merger, HCP, Inc. succeeded to the assets and the liabilities of CRC, including any liabilities for unpaid taxes and any tax liabilities created in
connection with the CRC merger. At the closing of the CRC merger, we received an opinion of our counsel substantially to the effect that on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions, for federal income tax purposes the CRC merger qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. If,
however, contrary to the opinion of our counsel, the CRC merger did not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the CRC merger would have been
treated as a sale of CRC's assets to HCP, Inc. in a taxable transaction, and CRC would have recognized taxable gain. In such a case, as CRC's successor-in-interest,
HCP, Inc. would be required to pay the tax on any such gain.

As a result of the CRC merger and the acquisition of SEUSA, HCP, Inc. and/or our subsidiary, HCP Life Science REIT, may be required to distribute
earnings and profits.

HCP, Inc. succeeded to the tax attributes, including the earnings and profits of CRC (assuming the CRC merger qualified
as reorganizations under the Code). Similarly, HCP Life Science REIT succeeded to the tax attributes, including the earnings and profits of SEUSA. To qualify as a REIT, HCP, Inc. and
HCP Life Science REIT must have distributed any non-REIT earnings and profits by the close of the taxable year in which each of these transactions occurred. Any adjustments to the
income of CRC or SEUSA for taxable years ending on or before the closing date of the applicable transactions, including as a result of an examination of the tax returns of either company by the
Internal Revenue Service, could affect the calculation of such company's earnings and profits. If the Internal Revenue Service were to determine that HCP, Inc. or HCP Life Science REIT
acquired



non-REIT
earnings and profits from one or more of these predecessor entities that HCP, Inc. or HCP Life Science REIT failed to distribute prior to the end of the taxable year
in which the applicable transaction occurred, HCP, Inc. and HCP Life Science REIT could avoid disqualification as a REIT by paying a "deficiency dividend." Under these procedures,
HCP, Inc. or HCP Life Science REIT generally would be required to distribute any such non-REIT earnings and profits to its respective stockholders within 90 days of the
determination and pay a statutory interest charge at a specified rate to the Internal Revenue Service. Such a distribution would be in addition to the distribution of REIT taxable income necessary to
satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and may require that HCP, Inc. or HCP Life Science REIT, as applicable, borrow funds to make the distribution even if the
then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for borrowings. In addition, payment of the statutory interest charge could materially adversely affect the cash flow of the applicable
REIT.

Risks Related to our Organizational Structure

Our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock.

Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock
that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a REIT. Under our charter, subject to certain exceptions, no person or
entity may own, actually or constructively, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common or preferred stock.

Additionally,
our charter has a 9.9% ownership limitation on the company's voting shares, which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock. Our board of directors, in its
sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit. The ownership limits may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price
for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Certain provisions of Maryland law and our charter and bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control transaction, even if the transaction involves a premium
price for our common stock or our stockholders believe such transaction to be otherwise in their best interests.

Certain provisions of Maryland law, our charter and our bylaws have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing transactions
that involve an actual or threatened change in control, even if these transactions involve a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe such transaction to be otherwise in their
best interests. These provisions include the following:

•

Removal of Directors.

Subject to the rights of one or more
classes or series of preferred stock to elect one or more directors, our charter provides that a director may only be removed by the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding shares or by a unanimous vote of all other members of the board of directors.

•

Stockholder Requested Special Meetings.

Our bylaws only
permit our stockholders to call a special meeting upon the written request of the stockholders holding, in the aggregate, not less than 50% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the business
proposed to be transacted at such meeting.

•

Advance Notice Provisions for Stockholder Nominations and
Proposals.

Our bylaws do not permit stockholders to nominate persons for election as directors at, or to bring other business before,
any meeting of stockholders unless we are notified in a timely manner, in writing, prior to the meeting.

•

Preferred Stock.

Under our charter, our board of directors
has authority to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without the approval of our
stockholders.



•

Duties of Directors with Respect to Unsolicited
Takeovers.

Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the
duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations. The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person
seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (c) act or fail to
act solely because of the effect that the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be
offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition. Moreover, an act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not
subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director. Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation
satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law.

•

Unsolicited Takeovers.

Under Maryland law, a Maryland
corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and at least three independent directors may elect to be subject to certain statutory
provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers which, among other things, would automatically classify the board of directors into three classes with staggered terms of three years each and vest in the
board of directors the exclusive right to determine the number of directors and the exclusive right, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, to fill vacancies on the board of
directors, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum. These statutory provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers also provide that any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold
office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred, rather than the next annual meeting of directors as would otherwise be the case, and until the
director's successor is elected and qualified.

An
election to be subject to any or all of the foregoing statutory provisions may be made in our charter or bylaws, or by resolution of our board of directors without stockholder approval. Any such
statutory provision to which we elect to be subject will apply even if other provisions of Maryland law or our charter or bylaws provide to the contrary. Neither our charter nor our bylaws provides
that we are
subject to any of the foregoing statutory provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers. However, our board of directors could adopt a resolution, without stockholder approval, to elect to become
subject to some or all of these statutory provisions.

If
we made an election to be subject to such statutory provisions and our board of directors was divided into three classes with staggered terms of office of three years each, the classification and
staggered terms of office of our directors would make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors since at least two annual meetings of stockholders, instead of one,
generally would be required to effect a change in the majority of our board of directors.

•

Maryland Business Combination Act.

The Maryland Business
Combination Act provides that, unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10% or more of its assets, issuances of shares of
stock and other specified transactions, with an "interested stockholder" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder
became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met. An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the
voting power of the outstanding stock of a Maryland corporation. Unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us, generally or with respect to certain transactions, from this statute in the
future, the Maryland Business Combination Act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons. In addition to the restrictions on business combinations provided under Maryland
law, our charter also contains restrictions on business



combinations.
Our charter requires that, except in some circumstances, "business combinations" between us and a "related person," including a beneficial holder of 10% or more of our outstanding voting
stock, be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our outstanding voting shares.

•

Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act.

Maryland law
provides that "control shares" of a corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes
eligible to be cast on the matter under the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act. "Control shares" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the
acquiror, would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power: one-tenth or more but less than
one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power. A "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of control shares, subject
to certain exceptions.

If
voting rights or control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholder's meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or
all of the control shares for fair value. If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholder's meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock
entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. If any of our shares are control shares acquired in a control share acquisition, they will be subject to the Maryland Control
Share Acquisition Act unless our bylaws are amended in the future to exempt the acquisition of control shares generally or with respect to certain transactions.

Our issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock, warrants or debt securities may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and reduce the market
price for our shares.

As of December 31, 2008, we had 253.6 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. We cannot predict the
effect, if any, that potential future sales of our common or preferred stock, warrants or debt securities, or the availability of our securities for future sale, will have on the market price of our
outstanding securities, including our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock, warrants or debt securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for,
common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price of our common stock. The sales of any such securities could also dilute the interests of
existing common stockholders and may cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. Additionally, we maintain equity incentive plans for our employees. We have historically made grants of
stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees under such plans, and we expect to continue to do so. As of December 31, 2008, there were options to purchase
approximately 5.1 million shares of our common stock outstanding of which 2.0 million shares are exercisable, approximately 380,000 unvested shares of restricted stock issued and
outstanding and approximately 864,000 unvested restricted stock units issued and outstanding under our equity incentive plans.

ITEM 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 2.    Properties

We are organized to invest in income-producing healthcare-related facilities. In evaluating potential investments, we consider a
multitude of factors, including:

•

Location, construction quality, age, condition and design of the property;



•

Geographic area, proximity to other healthcare facilities, type of property and demographic profile;

•

Whether the rent provides a competitive market return to our investors;

•

Duration, rental rates, operator and tenant quality and other attributes of in-place leases;

•

Current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet our operational needs;

•

Availability of security such as letters of credit, security deposits and guarantees;

•

Potential for capital appreciation;

•

Expertise and reputation of the operator or tenant;

•

Occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities;

•

The mix of revenues generated at healthcare facilities between privately-paid and government reimbursed;

•

Availability of qualified operators or property managers and whether we can manage the property;

•

Potential alternative uses of the facilities;

•

Regulatory and reimbursement environment in which the properties operate;

•

Tax laws related to REITs;

•

Prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing; and

•

Our access to and cost of capital.

ITEM 3.    Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Regardless of their merits, these matters may force us to expend significant financial resources. Except as described below, we are not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that we believe may
have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Our policy is to accrue legal expenses as they are incurred.
The information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part III, Item 15 of this Report, is incorporated herein by reference.

On
May 3, 2007, Ventas, Inc. filed a complaint against HCP in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky asserting claims of tortious interference with
contract and tortious interference with prospective business advantage. The complaint alleges, among other things, that we interfered with Ventas' purchase agreement with Sunrise Senior Living Real
Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT"); that we interfered with Ventas' prospective business advantage in connection with the Sunrise REIT transaction; and that our actions caused Ventas to suffer
damages. As set forth in a statement filed by Ventas on January 20, 2009, Ventas claims damages of $122 million representing the



difference
between the price it initially agreed to pay for Sunrise REIT and the price it ultimately paid, additional claimed damages of $188 million for alleged financing and other costs and punitive
damages.

We
believe that Ventas' claims are without merit and intend both to vigorously defend against Ventas' lawsuit and to aggressively pursue our counterclaims against Ventas as successor to
Sunrise REIT. As set forth in a statement filed by us on January 20, 2009, we seek recovery of damages in excess of $300 million against Ventas. Our counterclaims allege, among other things, that
Sunrise REIT (i) fraudulently or negligently induced us to participate in a rigged, flawed and unfair auction process, (ii) fraudulently or negligently induced us to enter into a confidentiality and
standstill agreement that was materially different from the agreement entered into with Ventas, (iii) provided unfair assistance to Ventas, and (iv) changed the rules of the auction at the last minute
and such change prevented us from bidding. The counterclaims further allege that at all times Sunrise REIT knew that we were the highest bidder and presumptive winner of the auction. Absent such
misconduct by Sunrise REIT, we allege that we would have succeeded in acquiring Sunrise REIT. The amended counterclaims allege that Ventas, in acquiring Sunrise REIT, assumed the liability of Sunrise
REIT to us. On December 23, 2008, Ventas filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings seeking dismissal of our counterclaims, and we have responded to Ventas' motion. The District Court has not
rendered a decision on Ventas' motion.

The
Court has set a trial date of August 18, 2009. We intend to pursue our claims described above vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that we will prevail on any of these
claims or the amount of any recovery that may be awarded. We expect that defending our interests and pursuing our own claims in the above matters will require us to expend significant funds. We are
unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary gain, loss or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2008.

ITEM 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical factual statements are "forward-looking statements." We intend to
have our forward-looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include this statement for purposes of complying with those
provisions. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers' intent, belief or expectations as identified by the use of words such as "may," "will,"
"project," "expect," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "seek," "forecast," "plan," "estimate," "could," "would," "should" and other comparable
and derivative terms or the negatives thereof. In addition, we, through our officers, from time to time, make forward-looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future
operations, strategies, securities offerings, growth and investment opportunities, dispositions, capital structure changes, budgets and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while
forward-looking statements reflect our good faith belief and reasonable assumptions based upon current information, we can give no assurance that our expectations or forecasts will be attained.
Therefore, readers should be mindful that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult
to predict. As more fully set forth in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors" in this report, factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations contained in the

(a)

Changes
in national and local economic conditions, including a prolonged recession;

(b)

Continued
volatility in the capital markets, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital;

(c)

The
ability of the Company to manage its indebtedness level, and changes in the terms of such indebtedness;

(d)

Changes
in federal, state or local laws and regulations, including those affecting the healthcare industry that affect our costs of compliance or increase
the costs, or otherwise affect the operations of our operators, tenants and borrowers;

(e)

Changes
in the reimbursement available to our tenants and borrowers by governmental or private payors, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment
levels and the availability and cost of third party insurance coverage;

(f)

Competition
for tenants and borrowers, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases;

(g)

Availability
of suitable properties to acquire at favorable prices and the competition for the acquisition and financing of those properties;

(h)

The
ability of our operators, tenants and borrowers to conduct their respective businesses in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase their revenues and
to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments to us;

(i)

The
financial weakness of some operators and tenants, including potential bankruptcies and downturns in their businesses, which results in uncertainties
regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators' and/or tenants' leases;

(j)

The
risk that we will not be able to sell or lease properties that are currently vacant, at all or at competitive rates;

(k)

The
financial, legal and regulatory difficulties of significant operators of our properties, including Sunrise Senior Living, Inc.;



(l)

The
risk that we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or achieve the operating efficiencies and other benefits of acquisitions
within expected time-frames or at all, or within expected cost projections;

(m)

The
ability to obtain financing necessary to consummate acquisitions or on favorable terms; and

(n)

The
potential impact of existing and future litigation matters, including related developments.

Except
as required by law, we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or
otherwise.

The
information set forth in this Item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. We

Executive Summary

We are a self-administered REIT that, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, invests primarily in real estate serving the
healthcare industry in the United States. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers. At December 31, 2008, our portfolio of
investments, excluding assets held for sale but including properties owned by our Investment Management Platform, consisted of interests in 694 facilities.

Our
business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) conservative financing. We actively redeploy capital from
investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorter-term to longer-term investments. We make investments where the expected risk-adjusted
return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator, tenant and other business relationships.

Our
strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us. We attempt to structure transactions that are tax-advantaged and mitigate risks in our
underwriting process. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our management team's experience and our infrastructure.

We
follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 51 properties for $643 million. At December 31, 2008, we had six properties with a carrying amount of $15.4 million classified as held for sale.

We
primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under long-term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triple-net leases or
leases that



provide
for substantial recovery of operating expenses; however, some of our MOBs and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such MOBs and life science
facilities we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our growth depends, in part, on our
ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels; (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures; and (iii)
control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions.

Access
to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy. Generally, we attempt to match the long-term duration of most of our investments with long-term
fixed-rate financing. At December 31, 2008, 15% of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates, which includes a balance of $520 million outstanding under our bridge and term loans. We intend
to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters.

Access
to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of
additional securities or secured debt. During 2008 we have raised $1.0 billion of equity capital, $656 million from asset dispositions, $566 million from the placement of Federal National Mortgage
Association ("Fannie Mae") secured debt and $197 million in a bank term loan. In 2008, there was a decline in the availability of financing from the capital markets and widening credit spreads. Our
ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions and the continuing slowdown in the economy, interest rates, credit ratings on our
securities, and any changes to these ratings, the market price of our capital stock, the performance of our portfolio, tenants, borrowers and operators, including any restructurings, disruptions or
bankruptcies of our tenants, borrowers and operators, the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any
deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us.

2008 Transaction Overview

Investment Transactions

During 2008, we made investments aggregating $228 million through the acquisition of a senior housing facility for $11 million,
purchase of marketable debt securities for $30 million, purchase of a joint venture interest valued at $29 million and funding an aggregate of $158 million for construction, tenant and capital
improvement projects primarily in the life science and medical office segments.

During
2008, we sold assets valued at $656 million, which included the sale of 51 properties for approximately $643 million and other investments for $13 million. Our sales of properties
and other investments during 2008 were made from the following segments: (i) $438 million of hospital, (ii) $97 million of skilled nursing, (iii) $94 million of medical office and (iv)
$27 million of senior housing.

During
2008, three of our life science facilities located in South San Francisco were placed into service representing 229,000 square feet.

Financing Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we raised $1.8 billion in capital through the issuance of common stock, placement of Fannie
Mae secured debt and the bank term loan market, which includes the transactions discussed below:

In
connection with HCP's addition to the S&P 500 Index on March 28, 2008, we issued 12.5 million shares of our common stock on April 2, 2008. In a separate transaction, we issued 4.5
million



shares
to a REIT-dedicated institutional investor on April 2, 2008. The net proceeds received from these two offerings in the aggregate were approximately $560 million, which were used to repay a
portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility.

In
May 2008, we placed $259 million of seven-year mortgage financing on 21 of our senior housing assets. The assets are cross-collateralized and the debt has a fixed interest rate of
5.83%. We received
net proceeds aggregating $254 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan.

In
June 2008, we settled two forward-starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $900 million. Upon settlement of these contracts and for the year ended December 31, 2008, we
recognized ineffectiveness charges of $3.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share of common stock, in interest and other income, net.

On
August 11, 2008, we issued 14.95 million shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of $481 million, which were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under
our bridge loan facility.

In
September 2008, we placed mortgage financing on senior housing assets through Fannie Mae aggregating $319 million, which was comprised of $140 million of five-year mortgage financing
on four assets and $179 million of eight-year financing on 12 assets. The assets are cross-collateralized and the debt has a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 6.39%. We received net proceeds
aggregating $312 million, which were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility.

On
October 24, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a $200 million unsecured term loan. The term loan accrues interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00%,
based on our current debt ratings, and matures in August 2011. The net proceeds of $197 million received by us from the term loan were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our
bridge loan facility.

On
December 19, 2008, we recognized a gain of $2.4 million related to the negotiated early repayment of $120 million of mortgage debt, at a discount, with an original maturity of January
27, 2009. The mortgage debt was repaid with funds available under our revolving line of credit facility.

Other Events

On July 30, 2008, we received and recognized lease termination income of $18 million from a tenant in connection with the early
termination of three leases representing 149,000 square feet in our life science segment. Upon termination of the leases, we recognized an impairment of $4 million related to intangible assets
associated with these leases.

On
September 19, 2008, we completed the restructuring of our hospital portfolio leased to Tenet and settled various disputes. The settlement provided for, among other things, the sale of
our hospital in Tarzana, California, valued at $89 million, the purchase of Tenet's minority interest in a joint venture valued at $29 million and the extension of the terms of three other hospitals
leased by us to Tenet. As a result of the sale of our hospital in Tarzana, California and the settlement of our legal disputes with Tenet, we recognized income of $47 million.

On
December 1, 2008, we completed the transfer of an 11-property senior housing portfolio to Emeritus. In connection with the transfer, we recognized impairments of lease related
intangible assets of $12 million.

Dividends

Quarterly dividends paid during 2008 aggregated $1.82 per share. On February 2, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors declared
a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.46 per



share.
The common stock dividend was paid on February 23, 2009 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2009.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires our
management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been
different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. For a description of the risk associated
with our critical accounting policies, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to HCP" in Item 1A. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or
assumptions prove to be different from actual
results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control,
through voting rights or other means. We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

, as revised ("FIN 46R"), for arrangements with variable interest entities ("VIEs"). We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE
at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event. We also apply Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5,

Investor's Accounting for an Investment in a
Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain
Rights

("EITF 04-05"), to investments in joint ventures.

Our
judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors including,
but not limited to, the form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, various cash flow scenarios related to the VIE, our
ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if
applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or upon a reconsideration event and determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE,
affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we were to perform a primary beneficiary analysis upon the occurrence of a future reconsideration event, our
assumptions may be different, which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.

If
we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE our consolidated financial statements would include the results of the VIE (either tenant or borrower) rather than the
results of our lease or loan to the VIE. We would depend on the VIE to provide us timely financial information, and we would rely on the internal controls of the VIE to provide accurate financial
information. If the VIE has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely impact our financial reporting
and our internal controls over financial reporting.



Revenue Recognition

Rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with GAAP, including SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

("SAB 104"). We recognize rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and
the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has
taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by
the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the
tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a
reduction of revenue over the lease term. The determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various
factors including, but not limited to:

•

whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;

•

whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;

•

whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and

•

whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease.

If
our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.

Certain
leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized
when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. The recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts
owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. Our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants
to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic
conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. We exercise judgment
in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our
consolidated financial statements.

We
use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference
between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the
lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized unearned income.

Loans
receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Loans held-for-investment are
carried at



amortized
cost, reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses. We recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the effective interest
method applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans.
Loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale when management's intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future. Loans held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of
cost or fair value.

Allowances
are established for loans and DFLs based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is deemed
probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and
requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrower's or lessee's overall financial condition,
resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if
appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan's or DFL's effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors. While our
assumptions are based in part upon historical data, our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Loans
and DFLs are placed on non-accrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on non-accrual status,
loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of
the loan or DFL, based on management's judgment of collectibility.

Real Estate

Real estate, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, is recorded at cost. We allocate the cost of the acquisition, including
the assumption of liabilities, to the acquired tangible assets and identified intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business
Combinations

. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141R,

Business
Combinations

, as revised ("SFAS No. 141R"). SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141R on
January 1, 2009 will, among other things, require us to prospectively expense all transaction costs for business combinations. The implementation of SFAS No. 141R on January 1, 2009 could
materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred rather than our past practice
of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.

We
assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash
flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired
property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant.

We
record acquired "above and below" market leases at fair value using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based on the
present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for each in-place lease, measured over a
period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus extended term for any



leases
with below market renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's
lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs,
we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases,
we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.

We
are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our
estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, ground leases, tenant improvements, in-place tenant leases,
favorable or unfavorable market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us. Each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve
complex calculations and judgments about useful lives. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities are not
subject to depreciation or amortization and those that are have different lives. Additionally, the amortization of value assigned to favorable or unfavorable market rate leases is recorded as an
adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in-place leases, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

We assess the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long Lived Assets

("SFAS No. 144"). We test our real estate assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows to the
carrying amount of the real estate asset or asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of
the real estate assets to their estimated fair value. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and to accurately estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing
and recognition of real estate asset impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions, such as the anticipated hold period for an asset, may have a material
impact on our financial results.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment by applying the two-step approach defined in SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,

at least annually and whenever we identify triggering events that may indicate impairment. Potential impairment indicators include a significant decline in real estate
valuations, restructuring plans or a decline in our market capitalization below book value. We test for impairment of our goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill
to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment. The second step requires the fair
value of the reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess
fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. We selected the fourth quarter of
each fiscal year to perform our annual impairment test.

The
evaluation of goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates when determining fair value, including, but not limited to, real estate market capitalization rates, projected
future cash flows, discount rates and the fair value of HCP. We estimated the fair value of HCP based on the market capitalization of our outstanding shares at December 31, 2008 and a control
premium of approximately ten percent. This control premium approximates comparable sale transactions during the 18 months



prior
to our impairment test. We also performed various sensitivity analyses in which real estate capitalization rates, discount rates and the control premium were expanded or contracted by 50 to 100
basis points, noting that the results would not lead to an impairment of our goodwill assets. Our estimates may differ from actual results due to, among other things, economic conditions or changes in
operating performance. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions, such as significant expansions in real estate market capitalization rates, may have a material
impact on our financial results.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee's earnings or losses are included in our consolidated
results of operations.

The
initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to
the sale of interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value.
When we determine that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary
and is below its carrying value, an impairment is recorded. The determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider
all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, and other relevant factors.
While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our
compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax
expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) the potential for built-in-gain recognized related to
prior-tax-free acquisitions of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included in income, other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired
in business combinations, which are adjusted through goodwill.

Results of Operations

We evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments—(i) senior housing, (ii) life science,
(iii) medical office, (iv) hospital, and (v) skilled nursing. Under the senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments, we invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties
through the acquisition and development of real estate and by providing financing to operators in these segments. Under the medical office segment, we invest through acquisition in MOBs that are
primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007
resulted in a change to our reportable segments. Prior to the SEUSA acquisition, we operated through two reportable segments—triple-net leased and medical office buildings. The senior
housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments were previously aggregated under our triple-net leased segment. SEUSA's results are included in our consolidated financial statements from
the date of acquisition of August 1, 2007. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).



Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007

We completed our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 and an investment in mezzanine loans with an aggregate face value of
$1.0 billion on December 21, 2007. SEUSA's results of operations and the results of these mezzanine loans are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective
dates.

•

Senior housing.

Senior housing rental and related revenues
decreased by $3.5 million to $289.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of income of $9.1 million recognized in 2007, resulting from our
change in estimate relating to the collectibility of straight-lined rents due from Emeritus, which was partially offset by the additive effect of our acquisitions during 2008 and 2007. No
significant changes in estimates related to the collectibility of straight-lined rents were made during the year ended December 31, 2008.

•

Life science.

Life science rental and related revenues
increased by $128.8 million, to $208.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. In addition,
included in life science rental and related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, is lease termination income of $18 million received from a tenant in connection with the early
termination of three leases on July 30, 2008 and rental revenues related to three development projects that were placed into service in 2008.

•

Medical office.

Medical office rental and related revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $18 million from assets that are no longer consolidated and are now in the HCP Ventures IV, LLC joint venture
("HCP Ventures IV"). The decrease in medical office rental and related revenues resulting from HCP Ventures IV was partially offset by the additive effect of our
MOB acquisitions during 2007.

The increase in tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on
August 1, 2007, three development projects that were placed into service in 2008, and the additive effect of our other acquisitions during 2007, partially offset by tenant recoveries related to
the assets contributed to HCP Ventures IV.

Income from direct financing leases.

Income from DFLs decreased $5.7 million to $58.1 million for the year ended
December 31,
2008. The decrease was primarily due to two DFL tenants exercising their purchase options on our leased assets during 2007 and two additional DFLs that were placed on non-accrual status
and accounted for on a cost-recovery basis beginning October 2008. No purchase options were exercised during 2008. We expect that income from DFLs will decline in 2009 as a result
of the two DFLs that are accounted for on a cost-recovery basis.

Investment management fee income.

Investment management fee income decreased $7.7 million, to $5.9 million, for the year ended
December 31, 2008. The decrease in investment management fee income was primarily due to the acquisition fees earned related to our HCP Ventures II joint venture of
$5.4 million on January 5, 2007 and HCP Ventures IV of $3.0 million on April 30, 2007. No acquisition fees were earned for the year ended December 31,
2008.

Depreciation and amortization expenses.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $55.7 million, to $314.6 million,
for the year
ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily related to our SEUSA acquisition and three development projects that were placed into service in 2008. The increase in depreciation
and amortization related to SEUSA was partially offset by our other acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 and by the 2007 expenses related to the assets contributed to HCP Ventures IV.

Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover a portion of those
expenses under the respective leases. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and
administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the
underlying nature of the expense.

•

Life science.

Life science operating expenses increased by
$17.3 million, to $43.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 and three development projects
that were placed into service in 2008.

•

Medical office.

Medical office operating expenses
decreased $0.9 million, to $135.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Medical office operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 include
$7.2 million related to assets contributed to HCP Ventures IV. The decrease in medical office operating expenses resulting from HCP Ventures IV was partially



offset
by the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions during 2007 and increased operating expenses in 2008.

•

Hospital.

Hospital operating expenses increased
$1.4 million, to $3.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result the additive effect of our hospital acquisitions during 2007.

General and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $7.3 million, to $75.7 million, for the
year ended
December 31, 2008. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in legal fees of $7 million primarily resulting from litigation and an increase of
$11 million related to compensation related expenses and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $10 million in merger and
integration-related expenses associated with the SEUSA acquisition and our merger with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. and CNL Retirement Corp., and a $2 million decrease in costs
related to acquisitions that were not consummated in 2007.

The
information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report, is incorporated herein by reference.

Impairments.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized impairments of $24.7 million as follows:
(i) $16.9 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of leases and (ii) $7.8 million related to three senior housing properties and one
hospital as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows. No assets were determined to be impaired during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Gain on sale of real estate interest.

On April 30, 2007, we sold an 80% interest in HCP Ventures IV, which resulted
in a
gain of $10.1 million. No similar transactions occurred during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Interest and other income, net.

Interest and other income, net increased $81.2 million, to $156.8 million, for the year ended
December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily related to an increase of $81.0 million of interest income from our HCR ManorCare mezzanine loan investment made in December 2007 and
$28.6 million related to the settlement of litigation with Tenet. The increase in interest and other income, net was partially offset by (i) $7.1 million of lower interest earned
on cash balances in 2008, (ii) a decrease in gains resulting from insurance proceeds of $4.9 million in 2007, (iii) an increase in losses from derivatives and hedge
ineffectiveness of $6.4 million, (iv) an increase in recognized losses of marketable equity securities and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $4.4 million,
(v) $3.5 million of fee income related to the early repayment of a loan in 2007, and (vi) a decrease in gains from the sale of marketable debt securities of $3.2 million.

Our
mezzanine investment bears interest on the $1.0 billion aggregate face amount at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 4.0%. During the second half of 2008, LIBOR significantly
declined. If interest rates stay at current levels or continue to decline, we expect interest income will decline in 2009 relative to amounts in 2008. For a more detailed description of our mezzanine
loan investments, see Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate loans is partially mitigated by our
variable rate indebtedness. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

Interest expense.

Interest expense decreased $7.1 million, to $348.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The
decrease
was primarily due to: (i) a decrease of $17 million related to the average outstanding balance under our bridge loan and a decline in LIBOR, (ii) an increase of $15 million
of capitalized interest related to an increase in assets under development in our life science



segment,
(iii) a decrease of $10 million resulting from the repayment of $300 million senior unsecured floating rate notes in September 2008, and (iv) a charge of
$6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees associated with our previous revolving line of credit facility that was terminated in 2007. The decrease in interest
expense was partially offset by: (i) an increase of $34 million of interest expense from the issuance of $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2007 and (ii) an
increase of $6 million related to the average outstanding balances under our line of credit and term loan. Our exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness
is mitigated by our variable rate investments. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

Income taxes.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, income taxes increased $2.8 million to $4.3 million. This increase
is
primarily due to an increase in taxable income related to a portion of one of our mezzanine loan investments, which was contributed to a TRS in January 2008.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, equity income from unconsolidated joint
ventures
decreased $2.3 million, to $3.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to a change in the expected useful life of certain intangible assets of one of our unconsolidated joint ventures
that resulted in higher amounts of amortization expense.

Minority interests' share in earnings.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, minority interests' share in earnings decreased
$2.3 million, to $21.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to the conversion of 2.8 million of DownREIT units into shares of our common stock during 2008, and to a lesser
extent, the purchase in September 2008 of Tenet's minority interest in Health Care Property Partners ("HCPP"), a joint venture between HCP and an affiliate of Tenet. We expect that these
conversions and the purchase of Tenet's minority interest in HCPP will decrease distributions of minority interests during 2009 relative to amounts in 2008. See Notes 2 and 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in this report for additional information on DownREIT units and HCPP. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements—An Amendment of ARB No. 51

("SFAS No. 160"). Upon
adoption on January 1, 2009, SFAS No. 160 requires us to include the net income attributable to the minority interests in our consolidated net income. However, the adoption of SFAS
No. 160 is not expected to significantly change the amount of net income applicable to common shares.



Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $244.2 million,
compared to
$473.4 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we
sold 51 properties for $643 million, as compared to 97 properties for $922 million in the year-ago period. Additionally, the decrease was attributable to a year over year decline in
operating income from discontinued operations of $51.4 million and an increase in impairment charges of $2.8 million. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008
included 57 properties compared to 154 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Also included in discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $6 million of
rental income we recognized, as
a result of a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight-line rental income from Emeritus.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006

We completed our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007, mergers with CRP and CRC on October 5, 2006 and the acquisition
of an interest held by an affiliate of General Electric ("GE") in HCP MOP on November 30, 2006, which resulted in the consolidation of HCP MOP beginning on that date. The results
of operations from our SEUSA, CRP and HCP MOP transactions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates.

Senior housing.

Senior housing rental and related revenues
increased $130.3 million, to $293.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $98 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the
CRP merger. Additionally, the results for the year ended December 31, 2007, include income of $9 million resulting from our change in estimate relating to the collectibility of
straight-line rents due from Summerville Senior Living, Inc. The remaining increase in senior housing rental and related revenues primarily relates to rent escalations and resets, and the
additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2007 and 2006.

•

Life science.

Life science rental and related revenues
increased by $64.7 million, to $79.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007.

•

Medical office.

Medical office rental and related revenues
increased $120.2 million, to $276.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $31 million of the increase relates to MOBs acquired in the
CRP merger and $64.7 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in medical office rental and related revenues primarily relates to the additive effect
of our MOB acquisitions in 2007 and 2006.

•

Hospital.

Hospital rental and related revenues increased
by $31.4 million, to $81.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $29.7 million of the increase relates to the

Hospital tenant recoveries increased as a result
of our hospital acquisitions in 2007.

Income from direct financing leases.

Income from direct financing leases increased $48.8 million, to $63.9 million, for the
year ended
December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of properties acquired from CRP, which are accounted for using the direct financing method. At December 31, 2007, these leased properties had a
carrying value of $640.1 million and accrued income at a weighted average interest rate of 8.5%. During the year ended December 31, 2007, two DFL tenants exercised their purchase options
and we received proceeds of $51 million and recognized additional income of $4.3 million.

Investment management fee income.

Investment management fee income increased $9.7 million, to $13.6 million, for the year
ended
December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition fees related to HCP Ventures II of $5.4 million on January 5, 2007 and
HCP Ventures IV of $3.0 million on April 30, 2007, partially offset by the decline in fees of $3.1 million resulting from our purchase of GE's interests in
HCP MOP on November 30, 2006.

Depreciation and amortization expenses.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $140.6 million, to $258.9 million,
for the
year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $64.8 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger, $19.2 million relates to the consolidation of
HCP MOP and $33.5 million relates to the SEUSA acquisition. The remaining increase in depreciation and amortization primarily relates to the additive effect of our other acquisitions in
2007 and 2006.

Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover a portion of those
expenses under the lease. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative or
operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of
the expense.

•

Senior housing.

Included in operating expenses are
facility-level operating expenses for three senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple-net basis. Periodically, tenants default on their leases, which
causes us to take possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third-party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the
property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in healthcare rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported operating
expenses for these facilities of $0.9 million, to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily due to an increase in the overall occupancy of such properties.

•

Life science.

Life science operating expenses increased by
$21.3 million, to $26.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007.

•

Medical office.

Medical office operating expenses
increased $70.9 million, to $136.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $34.8 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP and
$16.6 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger. The remaining increase in medical office operating expenses relates to the additive effect of our
acquisitions in 2007 and 2006.

•

Hospital.

Hospital operating expenses increased as a
result of our hospital acquisitions in 2007.

General and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $21.5 million, to $68.4 million, for the
year ended
December 31, 2007. Included in general and administrative expenses are merger and integration-related expenses associated with the CRC and CRP mergers and the SEUSA
acquisition of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $5 million in the prior year. Merger and integration-related expenses are primarily costs
from our CRP merger, such as employee transition costs as well as severance costs for certain of our employees whose responsibilities became redundant after the completion of the merger. The
remaining increase was primarily due to various items including increased professional and legal fees, federal and state taxes, and compensation related expenses.

Impairments.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized impairments of $3.6 million as follows:
(i) $1.0 million as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows from a senior



housing
facility and (ii) $2.6 million as a result of the contribution of 25 properties into a senior housing joint venture in January 2007. No properties were determined to be
impaired during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Gain on sale of real estate interest.

On April 30, 2007, we sold an 80% interest in HCP Ventures IV, which resulted in a
gain of
$10.1 million. There were no interests in joint ventures sold during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Interest and other income, net.

Interest and other income, net increased $40.9 million, to $75.6 million, for the year ended
December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily related to an increase of $24.0 million of interest income from $275 million of marketable debt securities, $9.3 million of
interest income from an $85 million loan acquired in the CRP merger and $7.6 million of interest income from cash and cash equivalents. During 2007, our marketable debt securities
accrued interest at rates ranging from 9.25% to 9.625%, and our $85 million loan accrued interest at a rate of 14%.

Interest expense.

Interest expense increased $144.0 million, to $355.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007.
This
increase was primarily due to (i) $106 million of interest expense from the issuance of $2.65 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2006 and 2007,
(ii) $43 million increase in our
outstanding mortgage debt resulting primarily from our acquisitions of CRP, consolidation of HCP MOP and other property acquisitions, (iii) $17 million from the increase in
outstanding indebtedness under our bridge and term loans and line of credit facilities, and the related amortization and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. The increase in
interest expense is partially offset by $11 million increase in the amount of capitalized interest relating to the increase in assets under development primarily from our acquisition of SEUSA
and $10 million decrease related to the repayment of $275 million of maturing senior unsecured notes during 2006 and 2007.

Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, equity income decreased $2.7 million,
to
$5.6 million. This decrease is primarily due to our consolidation of HCP MOP, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment, partially offset by equity income from
HCP Ventures II, III and IV.

Minority interests' share in earnings.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, minority interests' share in earnings increased
$9.5 million, to $23.5 million. This increase was primarily due to the



issuance
of 4.2 million non-managing member units of HCP DR MCD, LLC, in connection with our February 9, 2007 acquisition of a medical campus.

Discontinued operations.

Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $473.4 million, compared
to
$384.1 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $128.3 million and a decline in
impairment charges of $6 million year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold 97 properties for $922 million, as compared to 83 properties for
$512 million in the year-ago period. The increase was partially offset by a year over year decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $45.0 million.
Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 included 154 properties compared to 237 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in discontinued operations during the
year ended December 31, 2007 was income of $6 million, resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight-line rental income from Emeritus
Corporation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal liquidity needs are to (i) fund normal operating expenses, (ii) repay the $320 million outstanding
balance on the bridge loan, (iii) meet debt service requirements, including $155 million of our mortgage debt maturing in 2009, (iv) fund capital expenditures, including tenant
improvements and leasing costs, (v) fund acquisition and development activities, and (vi) make minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code. We
believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations, provided by financing activities and from sales of assets during the next twelve months.

Access
to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of
additional securities or secured debt. During 2008, we raised $1 billion of equity capital, $656 million from asset dispositions, $566 million from the placement of Fannie Mae
secured debt and $197 million in the bank term loan market. As of January 31, 2009, we had a credit rating of Baa3 (stable) from Moody's, BBB (stable) from S&P and BBB (positive)
from Fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities, and Ba1 (stable) from Moody's, BB+ (stable) from S&P and BBB- (positive) from Fitch on our preferred equity securities. During 2008,
there was a decline in the availability of financing from the capital markets and widening credit spreads. Our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including
general market conditions and the continuing slowdown in the economy, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, and any changes to these ratings, the market price of our capital stock, the
performance of our portfolio, tenants, borrowers and operators, including any restructurings, disruptions or bankruptcies of our tenants, borrowers and operators, the perception of our potential
future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet
their obligations to us.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $568.7 million and $453.1 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash flow from operations reflects increased revenues
partially offset by higher costs and expenses, as well as fluctuations in receivables, payables, accruals and deferred revenue. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of
multi-tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors.

Net
cash provided by investing activities was $427.3 million during 2008 and principally reflects the net effect of: (i) $639.6 million received from the sales of
facilities, (ii) $155.5 million used to fund acquisitions and development of real estate, and (iii) $30.1 million used to purchase marketable securities. During 2008 and
2007, we used $60.0 million and $49.7 million, respectively, to fund lease



commissions
and tenant and capital improvements. We expect to fund development commitments of $36.5 million for 2009.

Net
cash used by financing activities was $1.0 billion for 2008 and included proceeds of (i) $1.1 billion from common stock issuances and exercise of options,
(ii) $579.6 million from the placement of mortgage debt and draws on construction loans, and (iii) $200 million from borrowings under our term loan. These proceeds were
partially offset by or used for (i) repayments of $801.7 million of borrowings under our line of credit, (ii) repayment of $1.0 billion of borrowings under our bridge loan,
(iii) repayment of $300 million of senior unsecured notes, (iv) repayment of mortgage debt aggregating $225.3 million and (v) payment of common and preferred
dividends aggregating $457.6 million. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding capital gains, to our
stockholders. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock.

At
December 31, 2008, we held approximately $15.0 million in deposits and $38.2 million in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants'
lease obligations and borrowers' loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts, subject to certain restrictions by mortgage lenders, if there are defaults under the
related leases or loans. Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors, and such changes may be material.

Debt

Bank line of credit and bridge and term loans.

Our revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks provided for an aggregate $1.5
billion of
borrowing capacity at December 31, 2008. This revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.325% to 1.00%, depending upon
our debt ratings. We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, depending upon our debt ratings. Based on our debt ratings on December 31, 2008, the
margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 0.55% and the facility fee was 0.15%. Our revolving line of credit facility matures on August 1, 2011. At December 31,
2008, we had $150 million outstanding under this revolving line of credit facility with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 1.36%.

At
December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our bridge loan was $320 million. The bridge loan had an initial maturity date of July 31, 2008 that has been
extended to July 30, 2009 through the exercise of two extension options. This bridge loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.425% to 1.25%,
depending upon our debt ratings (weighted-average effective interest rate of 2.19% at December 31, 2008). Based on our debt ratings on December 31, 2008, the margin on the
bridge loan facility was 0.70%.

Our
revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. A portion of these financial covenants become more
restrictive through the period ending March 31, 2009. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement, (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to
Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75 times,
and (iv) require a formula-determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance
with each of these restrictions and requirements of our credit revolving credit facility and bridge loan.

On
October 24, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a $200 million unsecured term loan, which matures on August 1, 2011. The term
loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.825% to 2.375%, depending upon our debt ratings (weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.68% at
December 31, 2008). Based on our



debt
rating on December 31, 2008, the margin on the term loan was 2.00%. We received net proceeds of $197 million, which were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness
under our bridge loan facility. The term loan contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements, similar to those included in our revolving line of credit and bridge loan. At
December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the term loan.

Our
revolving line of credit facility and bridge and term loans also contain cross-default provisions to other indebtedness of ours, including in some instances, certain
mortgages on our properties. Certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants,
including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy of such operator or tenant. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as
described above occurs, such default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse
consequences.

Senior unsecured notes.

At December 31, 2008, we had $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes
outstanding.
Interest rates on the notes ranged from 2.90% to 7.07% with a weighted average effective rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2008. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the
term of the related debt.

In
September 2008, we repaid $300 million of maturing senior unsecured notes which accrued interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus 0.45%. The notes were repaid
with funds available under our revolving line of credit facility.

The
senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt, cross-acceleration provisions and other customary terms. At December 31, 2008, we were in
compliance with these covenants.

Mortgage debt.

At December 31, 2008, we had $1.6 billion in mortgage debt secured by 198 healthcare facilities with a
carrying amount
of $2.8 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 1.03% to 8.63% with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 6.10% at December 31, 2008.

In
May 2008, we placed $259 million of seven-year mortgage financing on 21 of our senior housing assets. The assets are cross-collateralized and the
debt has a fixed interest rate of 5.83%. We received net proceeds aggregating $254 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility and
bridge loan.

In
September 2008, we placed mortgage financing on our senior housing assets through Fannie Mae aggregating $319 million, which was comprised of $140 million of
five-year mortgage financing on four assets and $179 million of eight-year financing on 12 assets. The assets are cross-collateralized and the debt
has a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 6.39%. We received net proceeds aggregating $312 million, which were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving
line of credit facility.

On
December 19, 2008, we recognized a gain of $2.4 million related to the negotiated early repayment of $120 million of mortgage debt, at a discount, with an
original maturity of January 27, 2009. The mortgage debt was repaid with funds available under our revolving line of credit facility.

Mortgage
debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by certain properties and is generally non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically
restricts transfer of the
encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the properties in good condition, requires maintenance of
insurance on the properties and includes requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also cross-collateralized by multiple
properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such properties.



Other debt.

At December 31, 2008, we had $102.2 million of non-interest bearing Life Care Bonds at two of our CCRCs and
non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of our senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively "Life Care Bonds").
At December 31, 2008, $42.4 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death, and $59.8 million of the
Life Care Bonds were refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

During October and November 2007, we entered into two forward-starting interest rate swap
contracts with notional amounts aggregating $900 million. In June 2008, we terminated these hedges per the cash settlement provisions of the derivative contracts. The termination of the
$500 million notional contract resulted in a payment of $14.8 million and the termination of the $400 million notional contract resulted in a cash receipt of $5.2 million.
We also have three interest rate swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008, which hedge fluctuations in interest payments on variable rate secured debt. At December 31, 2008, these
interest rate swap contracts had an aggregate notional amount of $45.6 million and a fair value of a $2.3 million liability, respectively. For a more detailed description of our
derivative financial instruments, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

We have a prospectus on file with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S-3, using a shelf registration process which expires in
2009. Under this "shelf" process, we may sell from time to time any combination of the securities in one or more offerings. The securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred
stock and debt securities. Each time we sell securities under the shelf registration, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities
being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through
agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include
repayment of indebtedness, working capital and potential acquisitions. During 2008, we issued approximately $1.0 billion of common stock under the shelf.



Equity

On April 2, 2008, we issued 17 million shares of our common stock and used the net proceeds received of approximately $560 million to
repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility.

On
August 11, 2008, we issued 14.95 million shares of our common stock and used the net proceeds received of approximately $481 million to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness
under our bridge loan.

At
December 31, 2008, we had 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, 7.8 million shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock and
253.6 million shares of common stock outstanding.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued approximately 438,000 shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, at an average price per share
of $30.71 for aggregate proceeds of $13.5 million. We also received $11.5 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. At December 31, 2008, stockholders' equity totaled $5.2 billion and our
equity securities had a market value of $3.8 billion.

As
of December 31, 2008, there were a total of 4.8 million DownREIT units outstanding in six limited liability companies in which we are the managing member: (i) HCPI/Tennessee, LLC;
(ii) HCPI/Utah, LLC; (iii) HCPI/Utah II, LLC; (iv) HCP DR California, LLC; (v) HCP DR Alabama, LLC; and (vi) HCP DR MCD, LLC. The DownREIT units are redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the
then-existing market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). For the year ended
December 31, 2008, we issued 3.7 million shares of our common stock upon the conversion of 2.8 million DownREIT units.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP Ventures II, HCP Ventures III and HCP Ventures IV, as
described under Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans
receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Our risk of loss for these properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect
would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under "Contractual Obligations."

Inflation

Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other
measures, and/or additional rent based on increases in the tenants' operating revenues. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real
estate taxes, insurance and utilities. Substantially all of our senior housing, life science, skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating
costs or reimburse us for all such costs. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases
described above.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

At December 31, 2008, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately
$1.0 billion of
variable rate mezzanine loans receivable and $111 million investment in leased assets whose rental payments fluctuate with changes in LIBOR. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable
rate investments is partially offset by (i) $150 million of variable rate line of credit borrowings, (ii) $520 million of variable rate bridge and term financing, (iii) $197 million of variable rate
mortgage notes payable, excluding $46 million variable rate mortgage notes which have been hedged through interest rate swap contracts, and (iv) $25 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes. Of
our consolidated debt of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2008, excluding the $46 million of variable rate debt where the rates have been swapped to a fixed rate, $892 million or 15% is at variable
interest rates.

Interest
rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt, loans receivable and debt securities unless such instruments mature or are
otherwise



terminated.
However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future
earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable-rate investments and
variable-rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2008, net interest income would improve by approximately $2.2 million, or $0.01 per common share on a diluted
basis. Assuming a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates under the above circumstances and taking into consideration that the index underlying many of our arrangements is currently below 50 basis
points and is not expected to go below zero, net interest income would decline by $1.1 million.

We
use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information in this regard.

At
December 31, 2008, we had three interest rate swap contracts outstanding which are designated in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships. On December 31 2008, the interest rate
swap contracts have an aggregate notional amount and fair value of $45.6 million and a $2.3 million liability, respectively. The derivative contracts mature in July 2020 and are currently recognized
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

To
illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on the noted hedging instruments. To do so, we applied various basis point
spreads, to the underlying interest rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments' change in fair value. The following table summarizes the analysis performed (dollars in
thousands):

Market Risk.

We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity and bond markets. We have investments in marketable debt
and equity
securities classified as available for sale. Gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized and losses are recognized when an other-than-temporary decline in value is
identified. The initial indicator of an other-than-temporary decline in value for marketable equity securities is a sustained decline in market price below the carrying value for that investment. We
consider a variety of factors in evaluating an other-than-temporary decline in value, such as: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost; the issuer's
financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects; any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry; and our investment horizon in relationship to an
anticipated near-term recovery in the stock or bond price, if any. At December 31, 2008, the fair value and cost, or the new basis for those securities where a realized loss was recorded, of
marketable equity securities was $3.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively, and the fair value and cost of marketable debt securities was $229 million and $295 million, respectively.

The
principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value for our debt
securities and senior unsecured notes payable are based on prevailing market prices. The fair value estimates for loans



receivable
and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.

See Index to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

ITEM 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures

None.



ITEM 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be
disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Also,
we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain
with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2008. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2008, at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2008 to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of HCP, Inc.

We
have audited HCP, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). HCP, Inc.'s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, HCP, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of HCP, Inc. as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 and our report dated February
9, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of HCP, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HCP, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also include the financial statement schedules-Schedule II: Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and
Schedule III: Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation. These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of HCP, Inc. at December 31, 2008
and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)   Business

HCP, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a Maryland corporation that is organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, together with its
consolidated entities (collectively, "HCP" or the "Company"), invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. The Company acquires, develops, leases, manages and
disposes of healthcare real estate and provides financing to healthcare providers.

(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

Management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that it controls,
through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, as
revised ("FIN 46R"), for arrangements with variable interest entities. FIN 46R provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights
("variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and the determination of which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where
either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without
additional subordinated financial support. The Company consolidates investments in VIEs when the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE at either the creation of the variable interest entity or
upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event. Qualifying reconsideration events include, but are not limited to, the modification of contractual arrangements that affects the
characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2008, the Company did not
consolidate any significant variable interest entities.

The
Company uses qualitative and quantitative approaches when determining whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes, but is
not limited to, the form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, various cash flow scenarios related to the VIE, our
ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace the Company as manager and/or liquidate the
venture, if applicable.

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had 81 properties leased to a total of nine tenants that have been identified as VIEs ("VIE tenants") and a loan to a borrower that has been identified
as a VIE. The Company acquired these leases and loan on October 5, 2006 in its merger with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. ("CRP"). CRP determined it was not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, and
the

F-7


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Company
is required to carry forward CRP's accounting conclusions after the acquisition relative to their primary beneficiary assessments, provided the Company does not believe CRP's accounting to be
in error. The Company believes that its accounting for the VIEs is the appropriate application of FIN46R. On December 21, 2007, the Company made an investment of approximately $900 million in
mezzanine loans where each mezzanine borrower has been identified as a VIE. The Company has also determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.

The
carrying amount and classification of the related assets, liabilities and maximum exposure to loss as a result of the Company's involvement with VIEs are presented below (in
thousands):

The
Company's maximum loss exposure related to the VIE tenants represents the future minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the respective
leases, which may be mitigated by re-leasing the respective properties. The Company's maximum loss exposure related to loans to VIEs represents the carrying amount of the respective loan.

See Notes 7 and 14 for additional description of the nature, purpose and activities of the Company's variable interest entities and the Company's
interests therein.

The
Company applies Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5,

Investor's Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole
General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

("EITF 04-5"), to investments in joint ventures. EITF 04-5 provides guidance on the type of rights held by the
limited partner(s) that preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with GAAP. The assessment of limited
partners' rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be
reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited
partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. EITF 04-5 also applies to managing member interests in limited liability
companies.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which the Company does not consolidate but for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant
influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company's share of the investee's earnings or losses are
included in the Company's consolidated results of operations.

The
initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to
the sale of interests in the joint venture. To the extent that the Company's cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is generally amortized
over the life of the related assets and liabilities and included in the Company's share of equity in earnings of the joint venture. The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment
based upon a

F-8


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

comparison
of the fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When the Company determines a decline in the estimated fair value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint
venture below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. The Company recognizes gains on the sale of interests in joint ventures to the extent the economic substance of the
transaction is a sale in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in Real Estate
Ventures

, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 66,

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate

("SFAS No. 66").

Revenue Recognition

Rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with GAAP, including SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

("SAB 104"). The Company recognizes rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably
assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, the Company recognizes revenue upon acquisition of the asset
provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for
accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or the Company. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of
the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is
treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement
ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:

•

whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;

•

whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;

•

whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and

•

whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease.

Certain
leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized
when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized in accordance with SAB 104, which requires that
income is recognized only after the contingency has been removed (when the related thresholds are achieved), which may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such
payments are received.

Tenant
recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable
expenses are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with EITF Issue 99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
Agent

("EITF 99-19"). EITF 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded gross, as the Company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and
services from third-party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the credit risk.

For
leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, the Company recognizes income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental
income on a straight-line basis for leases results in recognized revenue exceeding amounts contractually due from

tenants.
Such cumulative excess amounts are included in other assets and were $112 million and $76 million, net of allowances, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. If the Company
determines that collectibility of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, the Company limits future recognition to amounts contractually owed, and, where appropriate, establishes an allowance
for estimated losses.

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability
of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. The Company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers
industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, the Company's assessment is based on amounts recoverable over the term of
the lease. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had an allowance of $40.3 million and $35.8 million, respectively, included in other assets, as a result of the Company's determination
that collectibility is not reasonably assured for certain straight-line rent amounts.

The
Company receives management fees from its investments in certain joint venture entities for various services provided as the managing member of the entities. Management fees are
recorded as revenue when management services have been performed.

The
Company recognizes gains on sales of properties in accordance with SFAS No. 66 upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Gains on properties sold are recognized using
the full accrual method when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, the Company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale, the initial investment from the
buyer is sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition under SFAS
No. 66 have been met.

The
Company uses the direct finance method of accounting to record income from direct financing leases ("DFLs"). For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are
recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is
deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized
unearned income.

Loans
receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Loans held-for-investment are
carried at amortized
cost, reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses. The Company recognizes interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the effective interest
method applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans.
Loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale when management's intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future. Loans held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of
cost or fair value.

Allowances
are established for loans and DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is
deemed probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. The allowance is based upon the Company's
assessment of the borrower's or lessee's overall financial condition, resources and payment record; the prospects

for
support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the
present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's or DFL's effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry
loss experience, and other relevant factors.

Loans
and DFLs are placed on non-accrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on non-accrual status,
loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of
the loan or DFL, based on the Company's judgment of collectibility.

Real Estate

Real estate, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, is recorded at cost. The Company allocates the cost of the acquisition,
including the assumption of liabilities, to the acquired tangible assets and identifiable intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

.

The
Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of
future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an
acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant.

The
Company records acquired "above and below" market leases at fair value using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based
on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each in-place lease,
measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with below market renewal options. Other intangible
assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of
carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes estimates of lost rents at
market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing
commissions, legal and other related costs.

The
Company capitalizes direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to
the acquisition, development or construction of a real estate project. In accordance with SFAS No. 34,

Capitalization of Interest Cost

, and SFAS No. 67,

Accounting for Costs and
Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects

, construction and development costs are capitalized while substantive
activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. The Company considers a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant
improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, or after development
activities have ceased, are expensed as incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.

The Company computes depreciation on properties using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. Depreciation is discontinued when a
property is identified as held for sale. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over useful lives ranging up to 45 years. Above and below market lease intangibles are amortized primarily to
revenue over the remaining noncancellable lease terms and bargain renewal periods, if any. Other in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining noncancellable lease term and
bargain renewal periods, if any.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets

("SFAS No. 144"). The Company tests its real estate assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted
cash flows to the carrying amount of the real estate asset or asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the
carrying amount of the real estate assets to its estimated fair value.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment by applying the two-step approach defined in SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,

at least annually and whenever the Company identifies
triggering events that may indicate impairment. Potential impairment indicators include a significant decline in real estate valuations, restructuring plans or a decline in the Company's market
capitalization below book value. The Company tests for impairment of its goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. If the carrying value
exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment. The second step requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to
all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair
value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. The Company selected the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to perform its annual
impairment test.

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

Certain long-lived assets are classified as held-for-sale in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value less cost to sell and are no longer depreciated. Discontinued operations is defined in SFAS No. 144 as a component of an entity that
has either been disposed of or is deemed to be held for sale if, (i) the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of the disposal
transaction, and (ii) the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.

Assets Held for Contribution

Properties classified as held for contribution to joint ventures qualify as held for sale under SFAS No. 144, but are not included in
discontinued operations due to the Company's continuing interest in the ventures.

Stock-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense is recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based
Payments

, as revised ("SFAS No. 123R"). On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application transition method which provides for
only current and future period stock-based awards to be measured and recognized at fair value.

SFAS
No. 123R requires all share-based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006 to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based
on their fair values. Compensation expense for awards with graded vesting is generally recognized ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on
the employee providing additional services. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company applied SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, as amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

,
for stock-based awards granted prior to January 1, 2006.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased. The Company maintains cash deposits with major financial institutions which periodically exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. The Company has not experienced
any losses to date related to cash or cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts held by mortgage lenders to provide for (i) future real estate tax expenditures, tenant
improvements and capital improvements, and (ii) security deposits and net proceeds from property sales that were executed as tax-deferred dispositions.

Derivatives

During its normal course of business, the Company uses certain types of derivative instruments for the purpose of managing interest
rate risk. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivative instruments used for risk management purposes must effectively reduce the risk exposure that they are designed to hedge. In addition, at
inception of a qualifying hedging relationship, the underlying transaction or transactions, must be, and are expected to remain, probable of occurring in accordance with the Company's related
assertions.

The
Company applies SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended ("SFAS No. 133"). SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. It requires the recognition of
all derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives required to be bifurcated, as assets or liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133 are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as hedging
instruments in qualifying hedging relationships, the change in fair value of the effective portion of the derivatives is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) whereas the change
in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings.

The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions.

F-13


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

This
process includes designating all derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship to specific forecasted transactions or recognized obligations in the balance sheet. The Company also assesses
and documents, both at the hedging instrument's inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes
in cash flows associated with the respective hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or that it is probable the underlying forecasted
transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and reclassifies amounts recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings.

Income Taxes

In 1985, HCP, Inc. elected REIT status and believes it has always operated so as to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to
860 of the Internal Revenue
code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Accordingly, HCP, Inc. will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that it continues to qualify as a REIT and makes distributions to stockholders
equal to or in excess of its taxable income. On July 27, 2007, the Company formed HCP Life Science REIT, a consolidated subsidiary, which elected REIT status for the year ended December 31, 2007. HCP,
Inc., along with its consolidated REIT subsidiary, are each subject to the REIT qualification requirements under Sections 856 to 860 of the Code. If either REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any
taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years.

HCP,
Inc. and HCP Life Science REIT are subject to state and local income taxes in some jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances each REIT may also be subject to federal excise taxes
on undistributed income. In addition, certain activities the Company undertakes must be conducted by entities which elect to be treated as TRSs. TRSs are subject to both federal and state income
taxes.

On
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes

("FIN 48"). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in a company's financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. It prescribes a recognition threshold as well as measurement criteria for evaluating tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition of previously recognized positions and the treatment of potential interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes tax penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as additional tax expense. Interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized as interest
expense.

Marketable Securities

The Company classifies its marketable equity and debt securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. These securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
recognized in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined based on the specific identification method. When
the Company determines declines in fair value of marketable securities are other-than-temporary, a realized loss is recognized in earnings.

Capital Raising Issuance Costs

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of common shares are recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital. Costs
incurred in connection with the issuance of preferred shares are recorded as a reduction of the preferred stock amount. Debt issuance costs are deferred, included in other assets and amortized to
interest expense based on the effective interest method over the remaining term of the related debt.

Segment Reporting

The Company reports its consolidated financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

("SFAS No. 131"). The Company's segments are based on the Company's method of internal reporting which classifies its
operations by healthcare sector. The Company's business includes five segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical office, (iv) hospital and (v) skilled nursing.

Prior
to the Slough Estates USA Inc. ("SEUSA") acquisition on August 1, 2007, the Company operated through two reportable segments—triple-net leased and medical office
buildings. As a result of the Company's acquisition of SEUSA, the Company added a significant portfolio of real estate assets under different leasing and property management structures and made
corresponding organizational changes. The Company believes the change to its reportable segments is appropriate and consistent with how its chief operating decision maker reviews the Company's
operating results. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 131, all prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Minority Interests and Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments

As of December 31, 2008, there were 4.8 million non-managing member units outstanding in six limited liability companies, all of which
the Company is the managing member: (i) HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; (ii) HCPI/Utah, LLC; (iii) HCPI/Utah II, LLC; (iv) HCP DR California, LLC; (v) HCP DR Alabama, LLC; and (vi) HCP DR MCD, LLC. The Company
consolidates these entities since it exercises control and carries the minority interests at cost. The non-managing member LLC Units ("DownREIT units") are exchangeable for an amount of cash
approximating the then-current market value of shares of the Company's common stock or, at the Company's option, shares of the Company's common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock
splits and reclassifications). Upon exchange of DownREIT units for the Company's common stock, the carrying amount of the
DownREIT units is reclassified to stockholders' equity. In April 2008, as a result of the non-managing member converting its remaining HCPI/Indiana, LLC DownREIT units, HCPI/Indiana, LLC became a
wholly-owned subsidiary. At December 31, 2008, the carrying value and market value of the 4.8 million DownREIT units were $193.7 million and $178.8 million, respectively.

SFAS
No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

("SFAS No. 150"), requires,
among other things, that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments be classified as a liability and recorded at settlement value. Consolidated joint ventures with a limited-life are considered
mandatorily redeemable. Implementation of the provisions of SFAS No. 150 that require the valuation and establishment of a liability for limited-life entities was subsequently deferred. As of December
31, 2008, the Company has nine limited-life entities that have a settlement value of the minority interests of approximately $6.2 million, which is approximately $4.6 million more than the
carrying amount.

Preferred Stock Redemptions

The Company recognizes the excess of the redemption value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock redeemed over its carrying amount as
a charge to income in accordance with FASB—EITF Topic D-42,

The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of
Preferred Stock

("EITF Topic D-42"). In July 2003, the SEC staff issued a clarification of the SEC's position on the application of FASB EITF Topic D-42. The SEC staff's
position, as clarified, is that in applying EITF Topic D-42, the carrying value of preferred shares that are redeemed should be reduced by the amount of original issuance costs, regardless of where in
stockholders' equity those costs are reflected (see Note 15).

Life Care Bonds Payable

Two of the Company's continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs") issue non-interest bearing life care bonds payable to certain
residents of the CCRCs. Generally, the bonds are refundable to the resident or to the resident's estate upon termination or cancellation of the CCRC agreement. An additional senior housing facility
owned by the Company collects non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits that are refundable to the resident or the resident's estate upon the earlier of the re-letting of the unit or after two years
of vacancy. Proceeds from the
issuance of new bonds are used to retire existing bonds, and since the maturity of the obligations for the three facilities is not determinable, no interest is imputed. These amounts are included in
other debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Fair Value Measurement

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented the requirements of SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

("SFAS No. 157"), for its financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 refines the definition of fair value, expands disclosure requirements about
fair value measurements and establishes specific requirements as well as guidelines for a consistent framework to measure fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. Further, SFAS No. 157 requires the Company to maximize the use of observable
market inputs, minimize the use of unobservable market inputs and disclose in the form of an outlined hierarchy the details of such fair value measurements.

SFAS
No. 157 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a
marketplace. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable
market data when available. These inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1

—quoted prices for

identical

instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2

—quoted prices for

similar

instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations
in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and

•

Level 3

—fair value measurements derived from valuation
techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are

unobservable

.

The
Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all financial assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value.
When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third party source to determine fair

F-16


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

value
and classifies such items in Level 1. In some instances where a market price is available, but in an inactive or over-the-counter market where significant fluctuations in pricing can occur, the
Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and classifies the financial asset or liability in Level 2.

If
quoted market prices or inputs are not available, fair value measurements are based upon valuation models that utilize current market or independently sourced market inputs, such as
interest rates, option volatilities, credit spreads, etc. Items valued using such internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement. As a result, a financial asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
Internal fair value models and techniques used by the Company include discounted cash flow and Black Scholes valuation models.

Based
on the guidelines of SFAS No. 157, the Company has amended its techniques used in measuring the fair value of derivative and other financial asset and liability positions.
These enhancements include the impact of the Company's or counterparty's credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value as well as the election of the mid-market pricing
expedient outlined in the standard. The implementation of these enhancements and the adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

On
February 12, 2008, the FASB postponed the implementation of SFAS No. 157 related to non-financial assets and liabilities until fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2008.
As a result, the Company has not applied the above fair value procedures to its goodwill and long-lived asset impairment analyses during the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company believes that the
adoption of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations upon implementation for fiscal
periods beginning after November 15, 2008.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

("SFAS No. 159").
SFAS No. 159 permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. SFAS No. 159 was effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year after
November 15, 2007, and reporting periods thereafter. Currently the Company has not adopted the guidelines of SFAS No. 159 and continues to evaluate whether or not it will in future periods based on
industry participant elections and financial reporting consistency with its peers.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,

Business Combinations

, as revised
("SFAS No. 141R"). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed (including intangibles), and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS No. 141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business
combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141R on January 1, 2009 will require the Company to prospectively expense all transaction costs for business combinations
for which the acquisition date is on or subsequent to that date. Retroactive application of SFAS No. 141R to fiscal years preceding the effective date is not permitted. The implementation of this
standard on January 1,

could materially impact the Company's future financial results to the extent that it acquires significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred rather
than the Company's current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB 51

("SFAS No. 160"), which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of
equity separate from the parent's equity. Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income
attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and, upon a gain or loss of control, the interest purchased or sold, as well
as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009 and applies prospectively,
except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which apply retrospectively. To the extent that the Company purchases or disposes of interests in entities or real estate partnerships that
cause a change in control of periods subsequent to adoption, the impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations could be material, as these interests will be recognized at fair
value with gains and losses recorded to earnings.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No.

("SFAS No. 161"). SFAS No. 161 establishes, among other things, the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 161 requires
entities to provide enhanced disclosures about (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and
its related interpretations and (iii) how derivative instruments
and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008.
The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In
April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") Financial Accounting Standard 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets

("FSP FAS 142-3"). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142. In developing assumptions about renewal or extension, FSP FAS 142-3 requires an entity to consider its own historical experience (or, if no experience,
market participant assumptions) adjusted for relevant entity-specific factors in paragraph 11 of SFAS No. 142. FSP FAS 142-3 expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 142 and is effective

million among buildings and improvements, development costs and construction in progress, land, intangible assets and investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures from its preliminary
allocation at December 31, 2007. The changes from the Company's initial purchase price allocation did not have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations for the year ended December
31, 2008.

In connection with the Company's acquisition of SEUSA, the Company obtained, from a syndicate of banks, a financing commitment for a $3.0 billion
bridge loan under which $2.75 billion was borrowed at closing. See Note 11 for further details.

CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. and CNL Retirement Corp.

On October 5, 2006, HCP acquired CRP. CRP was a REIT that invested primarily in senior housing and medical office buildings located
across the United States. At the time of the CRP merger, CRP owned or held an ownership interest in 273 properties in 33 states.

Under
the merger agreement with CRP, each share of CRP common stock was exchanged for $11.1293 in cash and 0.0865 of a share of HCP's common stock, equivalent to approximately
$2.9 billion in cash and 22.8 million shares. Fractional shares were paid in cash. The Company financed the cash consideration paid to CRP stockholders and the expenses related to the
transaction through a $1.0 billion offering of senior unsecured notes and draw downs under term and bridge loans and a three year revolving line of credit facility. As of January 22, 2007, the
term and bridge facilities had been repaid with proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, secured debt and common stock, disposition of certain properties and from real estate joint ventures.
Simultaneously with the closing of the merger with CRP, HCP also merged with CNL Retirement Corp. ("CRC") for aggregate consideration of approximately $120 million, which included the issuance of 4.4
million shares of HCP common stock.

The DFLs were acquired in the Company's merger with CRP. CRP determined that these leases were DFLs, and the Company is required to carry forward
CRP's accounting conclusions after the acquisition date relative to their assessment of these leases, provided that the Company does not believe CRP's accounting to be in error. The Company believes
that its accounting for the leases is the appropriate accounting in accordance with GAAP. Certain leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the properties during or at the
end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial investment amount plus adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements. Certain leases also permit the Company to require the tenants to
purchase the properties at the end of the lease terms.

Lease
payments due to the Company relating to three land-only DFLs, along with the land, with a carrying value of $58 million at December 31, 2008, are subordinate to and serve as

On
October 5, 2006, through its merger with CRP, the Company assumed an agreement to provide an affiliate of the Cirrus Group, LLC with an
interest-only, senior secured term loan. The loan provides for a maturity date of December 31, 2008, with a one-year extension at the option of the borrower,
subject to certain conditions, under which amounts were borrowed to finance
the acquisition, development, syndication and operation of new and existing surgical partnerships. This loan accrues interest at a rate of 14.0%, of which 9.5% is payable monthly and the balance of
4.5% is deferred until maturity. The loan is subject to equity contribution requirements, borrower financial covenants, is collateralized by assets of the borrower (comprised primarily of interests in
partnerships operating surgical facilities, some of which are on the premises of properties owned by HCP Ventures IV or the Company) and is guaranteed up to $34.6 million through
a combination of (i) a personal guarantee of up to $9.0 million by a principal of Cirrus, and (ii) a guarantee of the balance by other principals of Cirrus under arrangements for
recourse limited only to their interests in certain entities owning real estate. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the borrower made principal payments aggregating $11.8 million
reducing the carrying value of this loan to $79 million at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the borrower did not meet the conditions necessary to exercise its extension
option and new terms are being negotiated. The Company has determined the loan to be impaired but no allowance has been provided based on the value of the collateral underlying the loan.

On
July 12, 2007, the Company received $44 million in proceeds, including $4 million in excess of the carrying value upon the early repayment of a secured loan
receivable due December 28, 2015. The

F-26

amount
received in excess of the carrying value of the secured loan receivable is included in interest and other income. This loan was secured by a hospital in Texas and carried an interest rate of
8.75% per annum.

On
December 21, 2007, the Company made an investment in mezzanine loans having an aggregate face value of $1.0 billion, for approximately $900 million, as part of
the financing for The Carlyle Group's $6.3 billion purchase of HCR ManorCare. These interest-only loans mature in January 2013 and bear interest on their face amounts
at a floating rate of one-month LIBOR plus 4.0%. These loans are mandatorily pre-payable in January 2012 unless the borrower satisfies certain financial conditions. The
loans are secured by an indirect pledge of equity ownership in 339 HCR ManorCare facilities located in 30 states and are subordinate to other debt of approximately
$3.6 billion at closing. At December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of these loans was $918 million.

earnings, if any.

Marketable securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2008 are not considered to be other-than-temporarily
impaired as the Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. The Company's marketable debt
securities accrue interest ranging from 9.25% to 9.625%, and mature between November 2016 and May 2017.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company purchased $32 million of senior secured notes for $30 million that accrue interest at 9.625% and mature on
November 15, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company sold marketable debt securities for $11 million and $49 million, which resulted in gains of
approximately $0.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company realized gains from the sale of various marketable
equity securities totaling $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company also recognized losses

Bank Line of Credit and Bridge and Term Loans

In connection with the completion of the SEUSA acquisition, on August 1, 2007, the Company terminated its former
$1.0 billion line of credit facility and closed on a $2.75 billion bridge loan and a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The Company incurred
a charge of $6.2 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees associated with its previous line of credit facility in the year ended December 31, 2007.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company's revolving line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks provided for an aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2008. This revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.325% to 1.00%, depending upon the Company's debt
ratings. The Company pays a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, depending upon its debt ratings. Based on the Company's debt ratings at December 31,
2008, the margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 0.55% and the facility fee was 0.15%. The Company's revolving line of credit facility matures on August 1, 2011. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had $150 million outstanding under this revolving line of credit facility with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 1.36%.

At
December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of the Company's bridge loan was $320 million. The bridge loan had an initial maturity date of July 31, 2008 that has
been extended to July 30, 2009 through the exercise of two extension options. This bridge loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.425% to 1.25%,
depending upon the Company's debt ratings (weighted-average effective interest rate of 2.19% at December 31, 2008). Based on the Company's debt ratings at December 31, 2008,
the margin on the bridge loan facility was 0.70%.

The
Company's revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements, including cross-default provisions to
other indebtedness. A portion of these financial covenants become more restrictive through the period ending March 31, 2009. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the
agreement (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value
to 65%, (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75 times, and (iv) require a formula-determined Minimum
Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the
revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan.

On
October 24, 2008, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a $200 million unsecured term loan, which matures on August 1, 2011.
The term loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.825% to 2.375%, depending upon the Company's debt ratings (weighted-average effective
interest rate of 3.68% at December 31, 2008). Based on the Company's debt ratings on December 31, 2008, the margin on the term loan is 2.00%. The Company received net proceeds of
$197 million, which were used to repay a portion of its outstanding indebtedness under the bridge loan facility. The term loan contains certain financial restrictions and other customary
requirements, similar to those included in the revolving line of credit and bridge loan. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of
the term loan.

Senior Unsecured Notes

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes
outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 2.90% to 7.07% at December 31, 2008. The weighted-average effective interest rate on the senior unsecured notes at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, was 6.25% and 6.18%, respectively. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.

On
January 22, 2007, the Company issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes were priced at 99.323% of
the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.09%. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $493 million,

In April 2007, in anticipation of the formation of HCP Ventures IV, $122 million of 10-year term mortgage
notes were placed with an interest rate of 5.53%. The proceeds
from the placement of these notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company's previous $1.0 billion revolving line of credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.

In
May 2008, the Company placed $259 million of seven-year mortgage financing on 21 of its senior housing assets through Federal National Mortgage
Association ("Fannie Mae"). The assets are cross-collateralized and the debt has a fixed interest rate of 5.83%. The Company received net proceeds aggregating $254 million, which
were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan.

In
September 2008, the Company placed mortgage financing on its senior housing assets through Fannie Mae aggregating $319 million, which was comprised of $140 million of
five-year mortgage financing on four assets and $179 million of eight-year financing on 12 assets. The assets are cross-collateralized and the debt
has a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 6.39%. The Company received net proceeds aggregating $312 million, which were used to repay its outstanding indebtedness under the
revolving line of credit facility.

On
December 19, 2008, the Company recognized a gain of $2.4 million related to the negotiated early repayment of $120 million of mortgage debt, at a discount, with
an original maturity of January 27, 2009. The mortgage debt was repaid with funds available under our revolving line of credit facility.

Mortgage
debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by certain properties and is generally non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically
restricts transfer of the encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the properties in good condition,
requires maintenance of insurance on the properties and includes requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also
cross-collateralized by multiple properties and may require

or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such properties.

Other Debt

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $102.2 million of non-interest bearing Life Care Bonds at two of its
CCRCs and non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of its senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively "Life Care
Bonds"). At
December 31, 2008, $42.4 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death, and $59.8 million of the Life Care
Bonds were refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, payables, and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair value because
of the short maturities of these instruments. Fair values for loans receivable, bank line of credit, bridge and term loans, mortgage debt and other debt are estimates based on rates currently
prevailing for similar instruments of similar maturities. The fair values of the interest rate swaps and warrants were determined based on observable market assumptions and standardized derivative
pricing models. The fair values of the

(14) Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of the
Company's business. Regardless of their merits, these matters may force the Company to expend significant financial resources. Except as described in this Note 14, the Company is not aware of
any other legal proceedings or claims that it believes may have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition or results of
operations. The Company's policy is to accrue legal expenses as they are incurred.

On
May 3, 2007, Ventas, Inc. filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky asserting claims of
tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with prospective business advantage. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company interfered with Ventas' purchase
agreement with Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT"); that the Company interfered with Ventas' prospective business advantage in connection with the
Sunrise REIT transaction; and that the Company's actions caused Ventas to suffer damages. As set forth in a statement filed by Ventas on January 20, 2009, Ventas claims damages of
$122 million representing the difference between the price it initially agreed to pay for Sunrise REIT and the price it ultimately paid, additional claimed damages of $188 million
for alleged financing and other costs and punitive damages.

The
Company believes that Ventas' claims are without merit and intends both to vigorously defend against Ventas' lawsuit and to aggressively pursue its counterclaims against Ventas as
successor to Sunrise REIT. As set forth in a statement filed by the Company on January 20, 2009, the Company seeks recovery of damages in excess of $300 million against Ventas.
The Company's counterclaims allege, among other things, that Sunrise REIT (i) fraudulently or negligently induced the Company to participate in a rigged, flawed and unfair auction
process, (ii) fraudulently or negligently induced the Company to enter into a confidentiality and standstill agreement that was materially different from the agreement entered into with Ventas,
(iii) provided unfair assistance to Ventas, and (iv) changed the rules of the auction at the last minute and such change prevented the Company from bidding. The

F-36


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

counterclaims
further allege that at all times Sunrise REIT knew that the Company was the highest bidder and presumptive winner of the auction. Absent such misconduct by Sunrise REIT,
the Company alleges that it would have succeeded in acquiring Sunrise REIT. The amended counterclaims allege that Ventas, in acquiring Sunrise REIT, assumed the liability of
Sunrise REIT to the Company. On December 23, 2008, Ventas filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings seeking dismissal of the Company's counterclaims, and the Company has responded to
Ventas' motion. The District Court has not rendered a decision on Ventas' motion.

The
Court has set a trial date of August 18, 2009. The Company intends to pursue its claims vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will prevail on any of the
claims or the amount of any recovery that may be awarded. The Company expects that defending its interests and pursuing its own claims in the foregoing matters will require it to expend significant
funds. The Company is unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary gain, loss or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2008.

On
June 30, 2008, the Company, Health Care Property Partners ("HCPP"), a joint venture between the Company and an affiliate of Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet"), and Tenet
executed a definitive settlement agreement relating to complaints filed by certain Tenet subsidiaries against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles
in May, 2007, arbitration proceedings initiated by the Tenet subsidiaries during September, 2007, and counterclaims by the Company and HCPP, respectively, in such actions. The complaints
and proceedings relate to disputes arising out of default notices and lease terminations sent out by the Company and HCPP to Tenet and certain Tenet subsidiaries on or about April, 2007. On
September 19, 2008, the parties closed the transactions contemplated by the settlement agreement, effecting, among other things: (i) the sale of a hospital in Tarzana, California, by the
Company to a Tenet affiliate, (ii) the extension of the terms of three other hospitals leased by the Company to affiliates of Tenet, (iii) and the acquisition by the Company of Tenet's
23% interest in HCPP. The Company recognized $28.6 million of income from this settlement of the above disputes, which was included in interest and other income, net and a gain on sale
of real estate for the sale of the hospital in Tarzana, California, of $18.0 million.

Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of operators, tenants or obligors related to the Company's investments are engaged
in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the
Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. The Company regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio to assess potential concentrations of risks. Management believes
the current portfolio is reasonably diversified across healthcare related real estate and does not contain any other significant concentration of credit risks, except as disclosed herein. The Company
does not have significant foreign operations.

On
December 21, 2007, the Company made an investment in mezzanine loans to HCR ManorCare with an aggregate face value of $1.0 billion, for approximately
$900 million. At December 31, 2008, these loans represented approximately 77% of the Company's skilled nursing segment assets and 7% of its total segment assets.

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had 81 of its senior housing facilities leased to nine tenants that have been identified as VIEs ("VIE Tenants"). These VIE Tenants
are thinly capitalized entities that rely on the cash flow generated from the senior housing facilities to pay operating expenses, including rent obligations under their leases. The 81 senior
housing facilities leased to the VIE Tenants are operated by Sunrise Senior Living Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. ("Sunrise").
Sunrise is publicly traded and is subject to the informational filing requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is required to file periodic reports on
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the SEC.

To
mitigate credit risk of certain senior housing leases, leases are combined into portfolios that contain cross-default terms, so that if a tenant of any of the properties
in a portfolio defaults on its obligations under its lease, the Company may pursue its remedies under the lease with respect to any of the properties in the portfolio. Certain portfolios also contain
terms whereby the net operating profits of the properties are combined for the purpose of securing the funding of rental payments due under each lease.

At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company's gross real estate assets in the state of California, excluding assets held for sale, represented approximately 32% and 31% of the
Company's total segment assets, respectively.

DownREIT Partnerships

In connection with the formation of certain DownREIT partnerships, many partners contribute appreciated real estate to the partnership
in exchange for DownREIT units. These contributions are generally tax-deferred, so that the pre-contribution gain related to the property is not taxed to the partner. However,
if the contributed property is later sold by the partnership, the unamortized pre-contribution gain that exists at the date of sale is specially allocated and taxed to the contributing
partners. In many of the DownREITs, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with those partners who contributed appreciated property into the partnership. Under these indemnification
agreements, if any of the appreciated real estate contributed by the partners is sold by the partnership in a taxable transaction within a specified number of years after the property was contributed,
HCP will reimburse the affected partners for the federal and state income taxes associated with the pre-contribution gain that is specially allocated to the affected partner under
the Code ("make-whole payments"). These make-whole payments include a tax gross-up provision.

Master Trust Liabilities

Certain residents of two of the Company's senior housing facilities have entered into a master trust agreement with the operator of the
facilities whereby amounts paid upfront by such residents were deposited into a trust account. These funds were then made available to the senior housing operator in the form of a
non-interest bearing loan to provide permanent financing for the related communities. The operator of the senior housing facility is the borrower under these arrangements; however, two of
the Company's properties are collateral under the master trust agreements. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining obligation under the master trust agreements for these two properties is
$13.1 million. The Company's property is released as collateral as the master trust liabilities are extinguished.

Earn-out Obligations

Pursuant to the terms of certain acquisition-related agreements, the Company may be obligated to make additional payments
("Earn-outs") upon the achievement of certain criteria. If it is probable at the time of acquisition that the related properties Earn-out criteria will be achieved, the
Earn-out payments are accrued. Otherwise, the additional purchase consideration is recognized when the performance criteria are met. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
Earn-out obligations of $2.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively.

Credit Enhancement Guarantee

Certain of the Company's senior housing facilities are collateral for $136 million of debt (maturing May 1, 2025) that is
owed by a previous owner of the facilities. This indebtedness is guaranteed by the previous owner who has an investment grade credit rating. These senior housing facilities, which are classified as
DFLs, were acquired in the Company's merger with CRP. As of December 31, 2008, the facilities have a carrying value of $352 million.

Environmental Costs

The Company monitors its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
liability with respect to the properties that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company carries environmental insurance
and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limitations and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and current
industry practice.

HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

General Uninsured Losses

The Company obtains various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property, business interruption, liability, flood, windstorm,
earthquake, environmental and terrorism related losses. The Company attempts to obtain appropriate policy terms, conditions, limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss, the cost of
such coverage and current industry practice. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not
economically insurable. In addition, the Company has a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake, flood and windstorm and the insurance for such losses carries high deductibles. Should
a significant uninsured loss occur at a property, the Company's assets may become impaired for a period of time.

Tenant Purchase Options

Leases with certain tenants contain purchase options whereby the tenant may elect to acquire the underlying real estate. Annualized
lease payments to be received from leases,
including DFLs, subject to purchase options, in the year that these purchase options are exercisable, are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

(16) Segment Disclosures

The Company evaluates its business and makes resource allocations based on its five business segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical
office, (iv) hospital, and (v) skilled nursing. Under the senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments, the Company invests primarily in single operator or tenant properties
through acquisition and development of real estate and provides financing to operators in these sectors. Under the medical office segment, the Company invests through acquisition and development of
medical office buildings that are primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The
acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 resulted in a change to the Company's reportable segments. Prior to the SEUSA acquisition, the Company operated through two reportable
segments—triple-net leased and medical office buildings. The senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments were previously aggregated under the Company's triple-net
leased segment. SEUSA's results are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of the Company's acquisition on August 1, 2007. The accounting policies of the segments
are the same as those described under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see
Note 2). There were no intersegment sales or transfers during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company evaluates performance based upon property net operating income from continuing
operations ("NOI") of the combined properties in each segment.

Non-segment
assets consist primarily of real estate held for sale and corporate assets including cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, net and deferred financing costs. Interest
expense, depreciation and amortization and non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments in determining the Company's performance measure. See Note 14 for other
information regarding concentrations of credit risk.

Net
Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI") is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real
estate. The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant recoveries and income from direct financing leases, less property-level operating expenses. NOI excludes investment management fee
income, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain on sale of

F-44


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

real
estate interest, interest and other income, net, interest expense, income taxes, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests' share in earnings and discontinued
operations. The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an
unleveraged basis. The Company uses NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and assess property-level performance. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP
measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, the
Company's definition of NOI may not be comparable to the definition used by other real estate investment trusts, as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.

The following is a reconciliation from NOI to reported net income, the most direct comparable financial measure calculated and presented in
accordance with GAAP (in thousands):

(17) Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative instruments as hedges to mitigate interest rate fluctuations on specific forecasted transactions and recognized obligations. The
Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

The
primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market and credit risk. Market risk is defined as the potential for loss in value of the derivative instruments due to
adverse changes in market prices (interest rates). Utilizing derivative instruments allows the Company to effectively manage the risk of increasing interest rates with respect to the potential effects
these fluctuations could have on future earnings and cash flows.

Credit
risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation. The Company does not obtain collateral associated with its
derivative instruments, but monitors the credit standing of its counterparties, primarily global institutional banks, on a regular basis. Should a counterparty fail to perform, the Company would incur
a financial loss to the extent that the associated derivative contract was in an asset position. At December 31, 2008, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by counterparties to its
outstanding derivative contracts.

In
July 2005, the Company entered into three interest rate swap contracts that are designated as hedging the variability of expected cash flows related to floating rate debt assumed in
connection with the acquisition of a real estate portfolio. The cash flow hedges have a notional amount of $45.6 million and mature in July 2020. The aggregate fair value of the derivative contracts
is a $2.3 million liability and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. At December 31, 2008, no amounts of ineffectiveness for the derivative contracts were recorded.

In
August 2006, the Company entered into two treasury lock contracts that were designated as hedging the variability in forecasted interest payments, attributable to changes in the U.S.
Treasury rate, on the
forecasted issuance of long-term, fixed rate debt between September 1 and October 31, 2006. The cash flow hedges had a notional amount of $560.5 million and were settled with the counterparty on
September 16, 2006, which was the date that the forecasted debt was issued. The cash settlement value of these contracts at September 16, 2006, was $4.4 million. The unamortized amount of these
contracts at December 31, 2008, is $3.2 million and is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company determined that these treasury lock agreements were highly effective in
offsetting the variability in the forecasted interest payments. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to these hedges will be recognized as additional interest
expense on the Company's hedged fixed-rate debt, maturing 2011 and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized increased interest expense of $0.5 million and expects to
recognize an additional $0.5 million attributable to these contracts during 2009.

During
October and November 2007, the Company entered into two forward-starting interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $900 million. The interest rate swap
contracts are designated in qualifying, cash flow hedging relationships, to hedge the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate component of interest payments on forecasted,
unsecured, fixed-rate debt expected to be issued during the current fiscal year. As of September 30, 2008, the Company terminated these hedges per the cash settlement provisions of the derivative
contracts. The termination of the $500 million notional contract resulted in a payment of $14.8 million and the

F-46


HCP, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

termination
of the $400 million notional contract resulted in a cash receipt of $5.2 million. Upon settlement of these derivative contracts and at December 31, 2008, the Company revised its best
estimate of the hedged forecasted transactions, and as a result an ineffectiveness charge of $3.5 million was recognized in interest and other income, net during the year ended December 31, 2008. At
December 31, 2008, the Company expects that the hedged forecasted transactions remain probable of occurring. During the year ended December 31, 2007, there was no ineffective portion related to these
hedges.

Other Financial Derivative Instruments

As part of the Company's acquisition of SEUSA in August 2007, the Company received two warrants to purchase common stock in publicly
traded corporations that expire in 2013 and 2015. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, these derivative instruments had an aggregate fair value of $1.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively, and are
included in other assets. During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized expense of $1.1 million and income of $1.8 million, respectively, in interest and other
income, net due to changes in the fair value of the warrants.

(18) Income Taxes

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company's income tax expense was $3.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively. During the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company's income tax expense from continuing operations was $4.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The Company's federal and state income tax expense in 2006 was
insignificant. State taxes comprised $1.3 million, or 34%, of total income tax expense in 2008, and $1.7 million, or 49%, of total income tax expense in 2007. The Company's deferred income tax expense
and its ending balance in deferred tax assets and liabilities were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the tax basis of the Company's net assets is less than the reported amounts by $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. The difference between the
reported amounts and the tax basis is primarily related to the Company's acquisitions of SEUSA.

The
Company files numerous U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax returns. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local tax
examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 2004.

CRC Merger

On October 5, 2006, the Company merged with CRC, a corporation subject to federal and state income taxes. For federal income tax
purposes, the CRC merger was treated as a tax-free transaction resulting in a carry-over tax basis in its assets. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company's net tax basis in the CRC assets is less
than reported amounts by $70.1 million and $68.4 million, respectively.

SEUSA Acquisition

On August 1, 2007, HCP Life Science REIT, a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired the stock of SEUSA, causing SEUSA to become a qualified
REIT subsidiary. As a result of the acquisition, HCP Life Science REIT succeeded to SEUSA's tax attributes, including SEUSA's tax basis in its net assets. Prior to the acquisition, SEUSA was a
corporation subject to federal and state income taxes. HCP Life Science REIT will be subject to a corporate-level tax on any taxable disposition of SEUSA's pre-acquisition assets that occurred within
ten years after the August 1, 2007 acquisition. The corporate-level tax would be assessed only to the extent of the built-in gain that existed on the date of acquisition, based on the fair market
value of the asset on August 1, 2007. The Company does not expect to dispose of any asset included in the SEUSA acquisition, if such a disposition would result in the imposition of a material tax
liability. As a result, the Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability associated with this corporate-level tax. Gains from asset dispositions occurring more than 10 years after the acquisition
will not be subject to this corporate-level tax. However, the Company may dispose of SEUSA assets before the 10-year period if it is able to affect a tax deferred exchange. At December 31, 2008 and
2007, the tax basis of the Company's net assets included in the SEUSA acquisition is less than the reported amounts by $1.8 billion.

In
connection with the SEUSA acquisition, the Company assumed SEUSA's unrecognized tax benefits of $8.0 million. In addition, during 2008 the Company recognized other increases to
unrecognized tax
benefits of $0.9 million. A reconciliation of the Company's beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits follows (in thousands):

The Company anticipates that the balance in unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by $0.9 million in 2009 related to a request the Company
expects to file with federal and state taxing authorities to pay the unrecognized taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded interest expense associated with the
unrecognized tax benefits assumed in connection with the SEUSA acquisition of $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Interest expense associated with all other unrecognized tax benefits is not
significant.

The
Company has an agreement with the seller of SEUSA where any increases in taxes and associated interest and penalties related to years prior to the SEUSA acquisition will be the
responsibility of the seller. Similarly, any pre-acquisition tax refunds and associated interest income will be refunded to the seller.

There
would be no effect on the Company's tax rate if the unrecognized tax benefits were to be recognized.

(21) Compensation Plans

Stock Based Compensation

On May 11, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the 2006 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2006 Incentive Plan"). The 2006
Incentive Plan replaces the Company's 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Stock Incentive Plans") and provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options,
restricted stock and performance restricted stock units to officers, employees and directors in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. The maximum number of shares
originally reserved for awards under the 2006 Incentive Plan is 8.2 million shares. The maximum number of shares available for future awards under the 2006 Incentive Plan is 4.9 million shares at
December 31, 2008, of which approximately 2.5 million shares may be issued as restricted stock and performance restricted stock units.

Stock Options

Stock options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
Stock options generally vest ratably over a five-year period and have a 10-year contractual term. Vesting of certain options may accelerate upon retirement, a change in control of the Company, as
defined, and other events.

The
fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that
uses the assumptions noted in the table below. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of
the stock options granted was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees and turnover rates.

Restricted Stock and Performance Restricted Stock Units

Under the 2006 Incentive Plan, restricted stock and performance restricted stock units generally vest over a three- to five-year period
and have a 10-year contractual term. The vesting of certain restricted shares and units may accelerate upon retirement, a change in control of the Company, as defined, and other events. When vested,
each performance restricted stock unit is convertible into one share of common stock. The restricted stock and performance restricted stock units are valued on the grant date based on the market price
of a common share on that date. Generally, the Company recognizes the fair value of the awards over the applicable vesting period as compensation expense. Upon any exercise or payment of restricted
shares or units, the participant is required to pay the related tax withholding obligation. The 2006 Incentive Plan enables the participant to elect to have the Company reduce the number of shares to
be delivered to pay the related tax withholding obligation. The value of the shares withheld is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs. During
2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company withheld 99,000, 84,000 and 50,000 shares, respectively, to offset tax withholding obligations.

On
August 14, 2006, the Company granted 219,000 restricted stock units to the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The restricted stock units vest over a period of ten years
beginning in 2012. Additionally, as the Company pays dividends on its outstanding common stock, the original award will be credited with additional restricted stock units as dividend equivalents (as
opposed to receiving a cash payment). The dividend equivalent restricted stock units will be subject to the same vesting and other conditions as applied to the grant generally.

common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is
calculated by including the effect of dilutive securities. Options to purchase approximately 3.0 million and 0.6 million shares of common stock that had an exercise price

Mr.
Elcan, a former Executive Vice President of the Company through April 30, 2008, and certain members of Mr. Elcan's immediate family, including without limitation his wife and
father-in-law, may be deemed to own directly or indirectly, in the aggregate, greater than 10% of the outstanding common stock of HCA, Inc. ("HCA") at April 29, 2008. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, HCA
contributed $95 million, $83 million and $37 million, respectively, in aggregate revenues and interest income, for the lease of certain assets and obligations under debt securities.

Mr.
Elcan and Mr. Klaritch, an Executive Vice President of the Company, were previously senior executives and limited liability company members of MedCap Properties, LLC, which was
acquired in October 2003 by HCP and a joint venture of which HCP was the managing member. As part of that transaction, MedCap Properties, LLC contributed certain property interests to a newly-formed
entity, HCPI/Tennessee LLC, in exchange for DownREIT units. In connection with the transactions, Messrs. Elcan and Klaritch received 610,397 and 113,431 non-managing member units, respectively,
in HCPI/Tennessee, LLC in a distribution of their respective interests in MedCap Properties, LLC. Each DownREIT unit is redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of
two shares of HCP's common stock or, at HCP's option, two shares of HCP's common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications). In addition, the
HCPI/Tennessee, LLC agreement provides for a "make-whole" payment, intended to cover grossed-up tax liabilities, to the non-managing members upon the sale of certain properties acquired by
HCPI/Tennessee, LLC in the MedCap transactions and other events.

The
HCPI/Tennessee, LLC agreement was amended, with an effective date of January 1, 2007, to change the allocation of the taxable income among the members, to more closely correspond
with the relative cash distributions each member receives. Previously, taxable income was allocated disproportionately to the non-managing members to reflect the priority rights of the non-managing
member unit holders in distributions of cash. The amendment has no effect on the amounts of cash distributions to the non-managing members.
