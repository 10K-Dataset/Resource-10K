theft,” could adversely affect our business and financial performance or our reputation, and we could be liable for financial
losses incurred by third parties due to breaches of data shared between financial institutions;

·

natural or other disasters, including acts of domestic or foreign terrorism, could have an adverse
effect on BB&T in that such events could materially disrupt BB&T’s operations or the ability or willingness of BB&T’s
customers to access the financial services BB&T offers;

·

costs related to the integration of the businesses of BB&T and its merger partners may be
greater than expected;

·

failure to execute on strategic or operational plans, including the ability to successfully complete
and/or integrate mergers and acquisitions or fully achieve expected cost savings or revenue growth associated with mergers and
acquisitions within the expected time frames could adversely impact financial condition and results of operations;

·

significant litigation could have a material adverse effect on BB&T;

·

deposit attrition, customer loss and/or revenue loss following completed mergers and acquisitions
may be greater than expected;

·

higher than expected costs related to information technology infrastructure or a failure to successfully
implement future system enhancements could adversely impact BB&T’s financial condition and results of operations and
could result in significant additional costs to BB&T; and

·

widespread system outages, caused by the failure of critical internal systems or critical services
provided by third parties, could adversely impact BB&T’s financial conditions and results of operations.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied
by any forward-looking statement. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, BB&T undertakes no obligation

is a competitive advantage that strengthens the Company’s ability to effectively provide financial products and services
to businesses and individuals in its markets. Furthermore, BB&T believes its current market area will support growth in assets
and deposits in the future.


TableofContents

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive and constantly
evolving. BB&T’s subsidiaries compete actively with national, regional and local financial services providers, including
banks, thrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers, finance companies and insurance companies. In recent years, competition has
increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and BHCs. Consumers have the opportunity
to select from a variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The industry frequently sees merger activity, which affects
competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the franchises of acquirers. For additional
information concerning markets, BB&T’s competitive position and business strategies and recent government interventions,
see “Market Area” above and “General Business Development” below.

General Business Development

BB&T is a regional FHC and has maintained a long-term focus
on a strategy that includes expansion of asset size and diversification in terms of revenues and sources of profitability. This
strategy encompasses both organic growth and acquisitions of complementary banks and financial businesses.

Merger and Acquisition Strategy

BB&T’s growth in business, profitability and market share
has historically been enhanced by strategic mergers and acquisitions. Management intends to remain disciplined and focused with
regard to future merger and acquisition opportunities. BB&T will continue to assess bank and thrift acquisitions subject to
market conditions, primarily within or contiguous to BB&T’s existing footprint, and will pursue economically advantageous
acquisitions of insurance agencies, specialized lending businesses, and fee income generating financial services businesses. BB&T’s
strategy is currently focused on meeting the following acquisition criteria:

·

the organization must be a good fit with BB&T’s  culture;

·

the acquisition must be strategically attractive – meaning that any bank acquisition should be in BB&T’s existing
footprint to allow for cost savings and economies of scale or in contiguous states to provide market diversification, or the transaction
must be otherwise strategically compelling;

·

any risk-related issues would need to be quantified and addressed; and

·

the transaction must meet BB&T’s financial criteria.

During 2015, BB&T completed the purchases of Susquehanna Bancshares,
Inc. and The Bank of Kentucky Financial Corporation. BB&T also acquired 41 retail branches in Texas from Citigroup. During
2014, BB&T purchased 21 retail branches in Texas from Citigroup. See Note 2 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in
the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information about these transactions.

BB&T has reached an agreement and received approval from applicable
banking regulators to acquire National Penn Bancshares, Inc., which had $9.6 billion in assets and $6.7 billion in deposits as
of December 31, 2015. This transaction is currently expected to close on April 1, 2016.

Regulatory Considerations

The extensive regulatory framework applicable to banks, BHCs and
FHCs is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the DIF and the stability of the financial system, rather than for
the protection of shareholders and creditors. Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory landscape occurred with the
passage of the Dodd-Frank Act during 2010. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rulemaking activities continues to
occur. In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agencies, BB&T is subject to various other laws, regulations,
supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management
of BB&T and its ability to make distributions to shareholders.


TableofContents

BB&T’s earnings are affected by general economic conditions,
management policies, changes in state and federal laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including
those referred to in this section. Proposals to change the laws and regulations to which BB&T is subject are frequently introduced
at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on BB&T
is impossible to determine with any certainty. The description herein summarizes the significant state and federal laws to which
BB&T currently is subject. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions are described in this section, such descriptions
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions.

Financial Regulatory Reform

During the past several years, there has been a significant increase
in regulation and regulatory oversight for U.S. financial services firms, primarily resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank
Act is extensive, complex and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, representing
a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous
and far-reaching changes that affect financial companies, including banks, BHCs and FHCs such as BB&T.

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws are
subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. BB&T will continue to evaluate
the impact of any new regulations so promulgated, including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products
or disclosures required by the CFPB and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others.

As a BHC and a FHC under federal law, BB&T is subject to regulation
under the BHCA and the examination and reporting requirements of the FRB. Branch Bank, a North Carolina state-chartered commercial
bank, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC and the CFPB.

State and federal law govern the activities in which Branch Bank
engages, the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance
laws and regulations also affect its operations. Branch Bank is also affected by the actions of the FRB as it implements monetary
policy.

In addition to federal and state banking laws and regulations, BB&T
and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in securities underwriting, dealing, brokerage, investment
advisory and insurance activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations as well as supervision and examination
by other state and federal regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities, including the SEC, FINRA, NYSE and various state
insurance and securities regulators.

FHC Regulation

Under current federal law, as a BHC, BB&T has elected to become
a FHC, which allows it to offer customers virtually any type of service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including
banking and activities closely related thereto, securities underwriting, insurance and merchant banking. In order to maintain its
status as a FHC, BB&T and all of its affiliated IDIs must be well-capitalized and well-managed and have at least a satisfactory
CRA rating. The FRB has responsibility for overseeing compliance with these requirements. If the FRB determines that a FHC is not
well-capitalized or well-managed, the FHC has a period of time to comply, but during the period of noncompliance, the FRB can place
any limitations on the FHC that it believes to be appropriate. Furthermore, if the FRB determines that a FHC has not maintained
a satisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages
in such activities, although the FHC would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments
in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities.

Most of the financial activities that are permissible for FHCs also
are permissible for a bank’s “financial subsidiary,” except for insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio
investments, real estate investments and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted by a FHC. In order for a financial
subsidiary of a bank to engage in permissible financial activities, federal law requires the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates)
to be well-capitalized and well-managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that bank’s financial subsidiaries may
not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating;
and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.


TableofContents

Current federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation
under which the FRB is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, but BHC affiliates are principally regulated by functional regulators such
as the FDIC for state nonmember bank affiliates, the SEC for securities affiliates and state insurance regulators for insurance
affiliates. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in the bank
without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of functional regulation.
Although states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, states may continue to adopt and
enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable areas.

The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed new prudential regulation on depository
institutions and their holding companies. As such, BB&T is subject to more stringent standards and requirements with respect
to (1) bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers, (2) the “financial activities” in which it engages as a FHC, (3)
affiliate transactions and (4) proprietary trading, among other provisions.

Resolution Planning and Regulation QQ

FRB and FDIC regulations require “covered companies”
such as BB&T and systemically important financial institutions such as Branch Bank to file, maintain and update plans for a
rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (a “living will”). Both the FRB
and the FDIC must review and evaluate BB&T’s and Branch Bank’s living wills and are authorized to impose restrictions
on BB&T’s and Branch Bank’s growth and activities or operations if deemed necessary. The public portions of BB&T’s
and Branch Bank’s resolution plans are available in the Additional Disclosures section of the Investor Relations site at

www.bbt.com

.

CCAR and Stress Test Requirements

Current FRB rules require BB&T and other BHCs with $50 billion
or more of total consolidated assets to submit annual capital plans based on pre-defined stress scenarios. BB&T and other such
BHCs are also required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the FRB to monitor progress against
the BHCs’ annual capital plans. Covered BHCs, including BB&T, may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance
with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the FRB and as to which the FRB has not objected. The rules also require, among other
things, that a covered BHC may not make a capital distribution unless, after giving effect to the distribution, it will meet all
minimum regulatory capital ratios. See Table 3 for additional information about capital requirements. The FRB did not object to
BB&T’s 2015 capital plan, and the 2016 capital plan is expected to be submitted during April 2016.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to conduct an annual supervisory
stress test for BHCs, such as BB&T, with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets. The FRB’s stress test rules
also require BB&T and other covered BHCs to conduct a separate mid-year stress test, file the results of such test with the
FRB and publicly disclose details of the scenario and the impact on its capital. BB&T’s annual and midcycle stress test
results are available in the Additional Disclosures section of the Investor Relations site on www.bbt.com.

Effective for 2015, the FRB amended the capital plan and stress
test rules to modify the start date of the capital plan and stress test cycles from October 1 to January 1 of the following calendar
year. The FRB also amended the capital plan rule to limit a BHC’s ability to make capital distributions to the extent the
BHC’s actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan under baseline conditions, measured
on a quarterly basis.

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC to conduct an annual supervisory
stress test for FDIC-insured state nonmember banks such as Branch Bank with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets and
requires such institutions to conduct annual company-run stress tests. The results of the annual supervisory stress test are included
in the annual capital plan submitted to the FDIC.

The FDIC has modified the “as-of” dates for financial
data that covered banks with more than $10 billion in assets will use to perform their stress tests as well as the reporting dates
and public disclosure dates of the annual stress tests. The revisions to the regulations became effective on January 1, 2016.

Acquisitions

BB&T complies with numerous laws related to its acquisition
activity. Under the BHCA, a BHC may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares
or substantially all of the assets of any BHC or bank or merge or consolidate with another BHC without the prior approval of the
FRB.


TableofContents

Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks
and BHCs without geographic limitation, and a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered
in another state, subject to market share limitations and any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence
and operating for a minimum period of time. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction,
the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could
have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. These regulatory considerations are applicable to
privately negotiated acquisition transactions.

FRB rules prohibit a financial company from combining with another
company if the ratio of the resulting company's liabilities exceeds 10 percent of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all
financial companies.

Other Safety and Soundness Regulations

The FRB has enforcement powers over BHCs and their nonbanking subsidiaries.
The FRB has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule,
regulation, administrative order or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance
of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

There also are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed
on BHCs and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential
loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insurance fund in the event the depository institution
is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. For example, under requirements of the FRB with respect to BHC operations,
a BHC is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit financial
resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise. In addition, the “cross-guarantee”
provisions of federal law require IDIs under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated
by the DIF as a result of the insolvency of commonly controlled IDIs or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to commonly controlled
IDIs in danger of failure. The FDIC’s claim for reimbursement under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims
of shareholders of the IDI or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and nonaffiliated
holders of subordinated debt of the commonly controlled IDI.

Federal and state banking regulators also have broad enforcement
powers over Branch Bank, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver
in order to conserve the assets of Branch Bank for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. The North Carolina Commissioner
of Banks also has the authority to take possession of a North Carolina state bank in certain circumstances, including, among other
things, when it appears that such bank has violated its charter or any applicable laws, is conducting its business in an unauthorized
or unsafe manner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact its business or has an impairment of its capital stock.

Payment of Dividends; Capital Requirements

The Parent Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from
Branch Bank and its subsidiaries. The majority of the Parent Company’s revenue is from dividends paid by Branch Bank. Branch
Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, BB&T and Branch Bank are
subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at
or above regulatory minimums, and to remain “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations summarized
elsewhere in this section. Federal banking regulators have indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends
only if (1) the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully
fund the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital
needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. BB&T’s future capital actions will depend on the FRB’s review
of BB&T’s annual capital plans.

North Carolina law states that, provided a bank does not make distributions
that reduce its capital below its applicable required capital, the board of directors of a bank chartered under the laws of North
Carolina may declare such distributions as the directors deem proper.

The federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt
corrective action” in respect of IDIs and their BHCs that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five
capital categories for this purpose: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,”
“significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” To be considered “well-capitalized”
under these standards, an IDI must maintain the ratios shown above and must not be subject to any order or written directive to
meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.


TableofContents

Federal law also requires the regulatory agencies to implement systems
for “prompt corrective action” for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five capital
categories, with progressively more severe restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions according to the category
in which an institution is placed. Additionally, failure to meet capital requirements may cause an institution to be directed to
raise additional capital. Federal law further mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards generally relating
to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and authorizes administrative action against an institution
that fails to meet such standards.

In addition, failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking
organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities,
termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver.

U.S. Implementation of Basel III

During 2013, the FRB published final rules establishing a new comprehensive
capital framework for U.S. banking organizations known as Basel III. The rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements
applicable to BHCs and IDIs, including BB&T and Branch Bank. The rules define the components of capital and address other issues
affecting banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator
in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from Basel
I capital accords of the BCBS, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the BCBS's 2004
“Basel II” capital accords. The Basel III rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act
to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies' rules. BB&T qualifies as a standardized approach
banking organization and was required to comply with the new requirements beginning on January 1, 2015.

Institutions with greater than $250 billion in assets or $10 billion
in foreign assets are considered advanced approaches banking organizations, which results in a more complex calculation of RWA
that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk, among other changes. In addition, advanced approaches institutions
have additional reporting requirements and must calculate capital under both the standardized approach and the advanced approaches
and use the more conservative result. BB&T is preparing to comply with the advanced approaches requirements as it would become
subject to these requirements upon exceeding either of the asset thresholds.

The Basel III rules, among other things, (1) introduce a new capital
measure referred to as common equity Tier 1; (2) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of Tier 1 common equity and additional
Tier 1 capital instruments meeting specified requirements; (3) define Tier 1 common equity narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments
to regulatory capital measures be made to Tier 1 common equity and not to the other components of capital; and (4) expand the scope
of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations.

The Basel III rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings
that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and
more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets. The Basel III risk weight classifications generally
range from 0% for U.S. government securities to 600% for certain equity exposures, with a maximum risk weight classification of
1,250% for certain securitizations. This results in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the rules
provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty
and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.

The Basel III rules revise the “prompt corrective action”
directives by establishing more conservative ratio levels for well-capitalized status. In addition to the minimum risk-based capital
requirements, all banks must hold additional capital, the capital conservation buffer (which is in the form of common equity),
to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions, such as dividend payments, discretionary payments on Tier 1 instruments,
share buybacks, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, including heads of major business lines and similar
employees. The required amount of the capital conservation buffer will be phased-in annually through January 1, 2019.

BB&T is considered to be a “modified LCR” holding
company. BB&T would be subject to full LCR requirements if its operations were to fall under the “internationally active”
rules, which would generally be triggered if BB&T’s assets were to increase above $250 billion. BB&T produces LCR
calculations to effectively manage the position of High-Quality Liquid Assets and the balance sheet deposit mix to optimize BB&T’s
liquidity position. BB&T’s LCR was approximately 130% at December 31, 2015, compared to the regulatory minimum for such
entities of 90%, which puts BB&T in full compliance with the rule. The regulatory minimum will increase to 100% on January
1, 2017.

HMDA Regulations

The CFPB has issued final rules changing the reporting requirements
for lenders under the HMDA. The new rules expand the range of transactions subject to these requirements to include most securitized
residential mortgage closed-end loans and lines. The rules also increase the overall amount of data required to be collected and
submitted, including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers. BB&T will be
required to begin collecting the expanded data on January 1, 2018.

Enhanced Prudential Standards for BHCs and Foreign Banking

The FRB has adopted amendments to Regulation YY to implement certain
components of the enhanced prudential standards required to be established under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The amendments
became effective during 2014. The enhanced prudential standards include risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity
standards, requirements for overall risk management, stress-test requirements, and a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies
that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability. The amendments also establish
risk committee requirements and capital stress-testing requirements for certain BHCs and foreign banking organizations with total
consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.

FATCA and Conforming Regulations

During 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-33 (the “Notice”)
regarding FATCA and its related withholding provisions. The Notice announced that calendar years 2014 and 2015 are regarded as
a transition period for purposes of IRS enforcement and administration with respect to the implementation of FATCA by withholding
agents, foreign financial institutions and other entities with IRC chapter 4 responsibilities. The Notice also announced the IRS’s
intention to further amend the regulations under Sections 1441, 1442, 1471, and 1472 of the IRC. Prior to the IRS issuing these
amendments, taxpayers may rely on the provisions of the Notice regarding the proposed amendments to the regulations. The transition
period and other guidance described in the Notice are intended to facilitate an orderly transition for withholding agent and foreign
financial institution compliance with FATCA’s requirements and respond to comments regarding certain aspects of the regulations
under chapters 3 and 4 of the IRC. The new requirements became effective on December 31, 2015. BB&T is in compliance with the
applicable requirements.


TableofContents

Volcker Rule

The Volcker Rule implements section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act and
prohibits IDIs and affiliated companies ("banking entities") from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain
securities, derivatives, and commodity futures, and options on these instruments, for their own account. The final rules also impose
limits on banking entities' investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. Like the Dodd-Frank
Act, the rules provide exemptions for certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government
obligations, insurance company activities, and organizing and offering hedge funds or private equity funds. The rules also clarify
that certain activities are not prohibited, including acting as agent, broker, or custodian.

The compliance requirements under the rules vary based on the size
of the banking entity and the scope of activities conducted. Banking entities with significant trading operations will be required
to establish a detailed compliance program, and their CEOs will be required to attest that the program is reasonably designed to
achieve compliance with the final rules. Independent testing and analysis of an institution's compliance program also will be required.
The final rules reduce the burden on smaller, less-complex institutions by limiting their compliance and reporting requirements.
Additionally, a banking entity that does not engage in covered trading activities will not need to establish a compliance program.

Banking entities were required to conform proprietary trading activities
to the final rule by July 21, 2015. The FRB extended the compliance deadline to July 21, 2016 (and announced the intention to further
extend the deadline to July 21, 2017) for purposes of conforming investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign
funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013. Complying with these requirements is not expected to have a material impact
on BB&T’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Branch Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC
up to the limits set forth under applicable law. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that determines
assessment rates for an IDI based on an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk
each IDI poses to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank
Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under
the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.

Pursuant to an existing FDIC rule, regular assessment rates for
all banks will decline when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, which the FDIC expects will occur in early 2016. However, during 2015,
the FDIC proposed a rule that would impose on banks with at least $10 billion in assets a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their
assessment base, after making certain adjustments, for a period estimated by the FDIC to be two years. BB&T estimates that
the net effect of the proposed changes would increase BB&T’s total annual assessment by an amount within the range of
$40 million to $50 million.

Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations

In connection with its lending and leasing activities, Branch Bank
is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy
and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts.

CFPB

The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers
under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other
statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or
more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies.
The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial
products.

The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws
and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys
general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.


TableofContents

The CFPB has concentrated much of its rulemaking efforts on a variety
of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including mortgage origination disclosures, minimum underwriting
standards and ability to repay, high-cost mortgage lending, and servicing practices. The rules related to ability to repay, qualified
mortgage standards and mortgage servicing became effective during 2014, while the escrow and loan originator compensation rules
became effective during 2013.

A final rule integrating mortgage loan disclosures required by the
Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) and the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (“RESPA”) became effective
during October 2015. The final rule consolidated four existing and separate disclosures required under TILA and RESPA for closed-end
credit transactions secured by real property into two forms with a view towards making the mortgage loan disclosures less confusing
and more consumer friendly. Branch Bank delivered the functionality required to meet the effective date of October 3, 2015 for
the new integrated disclosures.

As a result of these rules, BB&T transferred the management
of certain home equity loans from direct retail lending within the Community Banking segment to the Residential Mortgage Banking
segment during 2014.

Interchange Fees

The FRB adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether
the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are “reasonable and proportional”
to the costs incurred by issuers for such transactions. Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are charges that merchants
pay to BB&T and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions.

During 2013, a U.S. Federal District Court judge ruled against the
debit card interchange fee limits imposed by the FRB, resulting in the potential for further reductions to these caps. During March
2014, the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the 2013 lower court decision. During January 2015, the U.S. Supreme
Court declined to hear the case, which preserved the limits established by the FRB.

Privacy

Federal law contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions,
including substantial customer privacy protections provided under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (commonly known
as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act). Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception
of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling of
customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions,
an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the
customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal
law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial
nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.

CRA

The CRA requires Branch Bank’s primary federal bank regulatory
agency, the FDIC, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including
low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,”
“Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” This assessment is reviewed for any bank that applies
to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an IDI, or to open or relocate a branch office.
The CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a FHC, such as BB&T, also is assessed by the FRB in connection with any acquisition
or merger application.

Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation

The FRB and FDIC have enacted consumer protection regulations related
to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions. Regulation E prohibits financial institutions from charging
consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents,
or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Financial institutions must also provide consumers with a
notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service and the
consumer’s choices. In addition, FDIC-supervised institutions must monitor overdraft payment programs for “excessive
or chronic” customer use and undertake “meaningful and effective” follow-up action with customers that overdraw
their accounts more than six times during a rolling 12-month period. Financial institutions must also impose daily limits on overdraft
charges, review and modify check-clearing procedures, prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage
amounts and ensure board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs.


TableofContents

Patriot Act

The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law
enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to cooperate in the prevention, detection and prosecution of international money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering measures affecting IDIs, broker-dealers
and certain other financial institutions. The Patriot Act includes the IMLAFA, which requires such financial institutions to implement
policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and grants the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury
broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations.
The U.S. Treasury continues to issue regulations to implement the Patriot Act, which impose substantial obligations on financial
institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist
financing. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation
damage, or restrictions on business. In addition, the Patriot Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the
effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions.
BB&T expects to continue to devote significant resources to its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (“BSA/AML”)
program, particularly as risks persistently emerge and evolve and as regulatory expectations escalate.

Pay Ratio Disclosure

The SEC has adopted amendments to Item 402 of Regulation S-K to
require disclosure of: (1) the median compensation amount of the annual total compensation of all employees of a registrant (excluding
the CEO), (2) the annual total compensation of that registrant’s CEO and (3) the ratio of the median of the annual total
compensation of all employees (excluding the CEO) to the annual total compensation of the CEO. The rules will require such pay
ratio disclosure information for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

Cybersecurity

The CISA, which became effective on December 18, 2015, is
intended to improve cybersecurity in the U.S. by enhanced sharing of information about security threats among the U.S.
government and private sector entities, including financial institutions. The CISA also authorizes companies to monitor their
own systems notwithstanding any other provision of law, and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own
systems from cyber attacks. The law includes liability protections for companies that share cyber threat information with
third parties so long as such sharing activity is conducted in accordance with CISA.

Other Regulatory Matters

BB&T is subject to examinations by federal and state banking
regulators, as well as the SEC, the FINRA, the NYSE, various taxing authorities and various state insurance and securities regulators.
BB&T periodically receives requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state insurance
commissions and state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning BB&T’s business
and accounting practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.

Employees

At December 31, 2015, BB&T had approximately 37,200 employees,
the majority of which were full time, compared to approximately 33,400 employees at December 31, 2014.

Website Access to BB&T’s Filings with the SEC

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The following discussion sets
forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect BB&T’s financial condition and operations.
When a risk factor spans several risk categories, the below risks have been listed by their primary risk category. Other factors
that could affect the Company’s financial condition and operations are discussed in the “Forward-Looking Statements”
section above. However, there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known, and factors besides those discussed
below, or elsewhere in this or other reports that BB&T filed or furnished with the SEC, that also could adversely affect the
Company.

Compliance Risk

Changes in banking laws could have a material adverse effect
on BB&T.

BB&T is extensively regulated under federal and state banking
laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal DIFs and the banking system as a whole.
In addition, BB&T is subject to changes in federal and state laws as well as changes in banking and credit regulations and
governmental economic and monetary policies. Any of these changes could adversely and materially affect BB&T. The current regulatory
environment for financial institutions entails significant potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs,
including those related to consumer credit, with a focus on mortgage lending.

Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to
take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher
deposit insurance premiums and limitations on BB&T’s activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business
and profitability.

The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, and its related
rulemaking activities, may result in lower revenues, higher costs and ratings downgrades. In addition, failure to meet the FRB’s
capital planning and adequacy requirements and liquidity requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and other banking laws may limit
the ability to pay dividends, pursue acquisitions and repurchase common stock.

The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects
of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit
insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, and changes among the bank
regulatory agencies. Under Dodd-Frank, BB&T is deemed to be a “systemically important” institution. Federal agencies
continue to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of these provisions remain subject to further rulemaking, guidance,
and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators, such as the Council, which will regulate the systemic risk of the financial
system. Additionally, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules that impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of
a residential mortgage. These rules implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending
Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. These rules have a direct impact on BB&T’s operations, as BB&T
is both a mortgage originator and a servicer.

Due to BB&T’s size, it is subject to additional regulations
such as the “living will” requirements relating to the rapid and orderly resolution of systemically important financial
institutions in the event of material financial distress or failure. BB&T cannot predict the additional effects that compliance
with the Dodd-Frank Act or any regulations will have on BB&T’s businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities.
Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect BB&T’s business, financial condition
or results of operations. See “Regulatory Considerations” for additional information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act and
its impact upon BB&T.

In addition, BB&T has been subject to assessment by the FRB
as part of the CCAR program. CCAR is an annual exercise by the FRB to ensure that institutions have forward-looking capital planning
processes that account for their risks and sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial
stress. BB&T cannot be certain that the FRB will have no objections to BB&T’s future capital plans submitted through
the CCAR program. Failure to pass the CCAR review could adversely affect BB&T’s ability to pay dividends, enter into
acquisitions and repurchase common stock.

BB&T may be subject to more stringent capital requirements,
which could diminish its ability to pay dividends or require BB&T to reduce its operations.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal banking agencies to establish
more stringent risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits applicable to banks and BHCs. The FRB approved final rules that
established a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and established a more conservative definition
of capital. These requirements, known as Basel III, became effective on January 1, 2015, and as a result, BB&T became subject
to enhanced minimum capital and leverage ratios. These requirements, and any other new regulations, including those that have been
proposed but not yet implemented as a result of the requirements established by the BCBS, could adversely affect BB&T’s
ability to pay dividends, or could require BB&T to limit certain business activities or to raise capital, which may adversely
affect its results of operations or financial condition. With approximately $209.9 billion in assets at December 31, 2015, BB&T
currently qualifies as a standardized approach banking organization under Basel III. Financial institutions with greater than $250
billion in assets or $10 billion in foreign assets are considered advanced approaches banking organizations, which results in a
more complex calculation of RWA that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk, among other changes. BB&T is
preparing to comply with the advanced approaches requirements and these more stringent requirements, or BB&T’s failure
to properly comply with them, could materially and adversely impact BB&T’s financial results and regulatory status. In
addition, the costs associated with complying with more stringent capital requirements, such as the requirement to formulate and
submit capital plans based on pre-defined stress scenarios on an annual basis, could have a material adverse effect on BB&T.
See “Regulatory Considerations” for additional information regarding the capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank
Act and Basel III.

BB&T is subject to extensive and expanding government regulation
and supervision, which can lead to costly enforcement actions while increasing the cost of doing business and limiting BB&T’s
ability to generate revenue.

The financial services industry is facing more intense scrutiny
from bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels,
particularly with respect to mortgage- related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with anti-money
laundering, Bank Secrecy Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control efforts, and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries
and nationals. Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority
includes, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to
issue cease and desist or removal orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated
parties. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Failure
to comply with these and other regulations, and supervisory expectations related thereto, may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits,
regulatory sanctions, reputation damage, or restrictions on business. In addition, federal bank regulatory agencies are required
to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities and other regulatory compliance
matters when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions and, consequently, non-compliance with the applicable regulations could
materially impair BB&T’s ability to enter into or complete mergers and acquisitions.

Differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations and
any potential resulting litigation may adversely impact BB&T’s financial statements.

Local, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws and
regulations differently than BB&T and challenge tax positions that BB&T has taken on its tax returns. This may result in
differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences
in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on BB&T’s
results. For example, as discussed in Note 12 “Income Taxes” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,”
during 2010, BB&T received an IRS statutory notice of deficiency for tax years 2002-2007 asserting a liability for taxes, penalties
and interest of approximately $892 million. Related developments resulted in a $516 million charge during 2013. Potential developments
in BB&T’s litigation or in similar cases could adversely affect BB&T’s financial position or results of operations.

Credit Risk

Changes in national, regional and local economic conditions and
deterioration in the geographic and financial markets in which BB&T operates could lead to higher loan charge-offs and reduce
BB&T’s net income and growth.

BB&T’s business is
subject to periodic fluctuations based on national, regional and local economic conditions, as well as conditions that may be
specific to particular sectors or industries. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material
adverse impact on BB&T’s operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur. BB&T’s banking
operations are locally oriented and community-based. Accordingly, BB&T expects to continue to be dependent upon local business
conditions as well as conditions in the local residential and CRE markets it serves. For example, an increase in unemployment,
a decrease in real estate values or increases in interest rates, as well as other factors, could weaken the economies of the communities
BB&T serves. Weakness in BB&T’s market area could depress its earnings and consequently its financial condition
because:

·

customers may not want or need BB&T’s products or services;

·

borrowers may not be able or willing to repay their loans;

·

the value of the collateral securing loans to borrowers may decline; and

·

the quality of BB&T’s loan portfolio may decline.

Any of the latter three scenarios
could require BB&T to charge off a higher percentage of loans and/or increase provisions for credit losses, which would reduce
BB&T’s net income. Credit deterioration, combined with flat to declining real estate values, would result in increased
loan charge-offs and higher provisions for credit losses, which may negatively impact BB&T’s net income. For example,
as of December 31, 2015, loan balances

related to the oil and gas industry

represented approximately 1% of our total loan portfolio. This amount

generally

consists of loans

for

oilfield services,

oil
and gas

exploration and production, and pipeline transportation of gas and crude oil.
Beginning in late 2014, oil prices began declining, which has had an adverse effect on some of our borrowers in this portfolio
and on the value of the collateral securing some of these loans. If such downturn in the oil and gas industry continues, the cash
flows of our customers in this industry could be adversely impacted, which could impair their ability to service any loans outstanding
to them and/or reduce demand for loans. These factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods,
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

A systemic lack of available credit,
a lack of confidence in the financial sector, volatility in the financial markets and/or reduced business activity could materially
adversely affect BB&T’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Potential downgrades of U.S. government securities by one or
more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on BB&T’s operations, earnings and financial
condition.

A possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the
U.S. government and a decline in the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact BB&T’s
ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affect the pricing of that funding when it
is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. BB&T cannot predict if, when or how
any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings
actions could result in a significant adverse impact on BB&T. For example, BB&T’s securities portfolio consists largely
of MBS issued by GSEs, such as FHLMC and FNMA. Among other things, a further downgrade in the U.S. government’s credit rating
could adversely impact the value of these securities and may trigger requirements that the Company post additional collateral for
trades relative to these securities. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of
related institutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which BB&T is subject and any
related adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations.

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely
affect BB&T.

Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of
trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BB&T has exposure to many different industries and counterparties,
and BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry,
including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutions. Many of these
transactions expose BB&T to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty. In addition, BB&T’s credit risk
may be exacerbated when collateral is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative
exposure. These types of losses could materially and adversely affect BB&T’s results of operations or financial condition.


TableofContents

Liquidity Risk

BB&T’s liquidity could be impaired by an inability
to access the capital markets, an unforeseen outflow of cash or a reduction in the credit ratings for BB&T or its subsidiaries.

Liquidity is essential to BB&T’s businesses. When volatility
or disruptions occur in the capital markets, BB&T’s ability to access capital could be materially impaired. Additionally,
other factors outside of BB&T’s control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third
parties, could impair BB&T’s ability to access capital markets or create an unforeseen outflow of cash or deposits. BB&T’s
inability to access the capital markets could constrain its ability to make new loans, to meet its existing lending commitments
and ultimately jeopardize its overall liquidity and capitalization.

BB&T’s credit ratings are also important to its liquidity.
Rating agencies regularly evaluate BB&T and its subsidiaries, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including
the financial strength of BB&T and its subsidiaries, as well as factors not entirely within BB&T’s control, including
conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. As a result, there can be no assurance that BB&T will maintain
its current ratings. A reduction in BB&T’s credit ratings could adversely affect BB&T’s liquidity and competitive
position, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets or trigger unfavorable contractual obligations.

Market Risk

Turmoil and volatility in global financial markets could have
a material adverse effect on BB&T’s operations, earnings and financial condition.

The negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from
foreign sovereign debt matters could adversely affect BB&T’s business, financial condition and liquidity. Global conflicts
and political activity could cause turmoil and volatility in the financial markets, which could reduce the value of BB&T’s
assets or cause a reduction in liquidity that adversely impacts BB&T’s financial condition and results of operations.

The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies,
including the FRB, have a significant impact on market interest rates, and BB&T’s business and financial performance
is impacted significantly by such interest rates.

BB&T’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal
and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the U.S., non-U.S. governments and international agencies. The
FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. The federal policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending
and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments. The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease
the value of certain of BB&T’s financial assets, most notably debt securities. Changes in the federal policies are beyond
BB&T’s control and, consequently, the impact of these changes on BB&T’s activities and results of operations
is difficult to predict.

Changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on BB&T’s
profitability.

BB&T’s earnings and financial condition are largely
dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest
paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect BB&T’s earnings and
financial condition. BB&T cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic
conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect
interest income and interest expense. As discussed in “Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Market Risk (Other
than Trading),” BB&T has ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in
market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on BB&T’s profitability.
For example, rising interest rates could adversely affect BB&T’s mortgage banking business because higher interest
rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages. Similarly, rising interest rates may increase the cost of
BB&T’s deposits, which are a primary source of funding. BB&T is also subject to the risk of a negative interest rate scenario, which implies that a depositor would pay a premium
for a financial institution to hold funds on deposit. In such a scenario, some depositors may choose to withdraw their deposits
in lieu of paying an interest rate to BB&T to hold such deposits. Negative rates would also diminish the spreads on loans
and securities. This scenario could have a material adverse effect on BB&T’s financial condition and results of
operations. While BB&T actively manages against these risks through
hedging and other risk mitigation strategies, if BB&T’s assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or
overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated, the Company’s risk mitigation techniques may
be insufficient.

Loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase the
Company’s funding costs.

Deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. BB&T competes
with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase because the Company may lose deposits and
replace them with more expensive sources of funding, clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or the Company
may need to raise its interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce the Company’s NIM, net interest
income and net income.

Operational Risk

BB&T faces cybersecurity risks, including “denial of
service attacks,” “hacking” and “identity theft” that could result in the disclosure of confidential
information, adversely affect BB&T’s business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure.

BB&T’s computer
systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks, such as denial
of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in
data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved
sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable
or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks and
other means.

Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large
financial services institutions, including BB&T. None of these events resulted in a breach of BB&T’s client
data or account information; however, the performance of BB&T’s website,

www.bbt.com

, was adversely
affected, and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing BB&T’s website. BB&T expects to be
subject to similar attacks in the future. While events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience, future cyber attacks
could be more disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational
harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and BB&T may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. BB&T may
incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or
loss.

Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, BB&T
will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and BB&T may not be able to implement effective preventive
measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide
variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations
or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of BB&T’s
systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. These risks may increase
in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its
internal usage of web-based products and applications.

A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences to BB&T, including
disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of BB&T or its customers, or damage to computer
systems of BB&T or its customers and counterparties. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy
and other laws, financial loss to BB&T or to its customers, loss of confidence in BB&T’s security measures,
significant litigation exposure, and harm to BB&T’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect.

BB&T relies on its employees, systems and certain counterparties,
and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations.

BB&T’s business is dependent on the ability to
process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. The Company could be materially adversely affected if one
or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or
intentionally. Financial, accounting, or other data processing systems may fail or have other significant shortcomings that
materially adversely affect BB&T’s business. BB&T’s systems may not be able to handle certain scenarios,
such as a negative interest rate environment. In addition, products, services and processes are continually changing and
BB&T may not fully identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could
diminish the ability to operate one or more BUs or result in potential liability to clients, increased operating expenses,
higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive
standing, any of which could be material to the Company.

If personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients
were to be mishandled or misused, significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss could occur. Such
mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who
are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information
was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.


TableofContents

BB&T may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems
arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include, for example, security breaches; electrical
or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies
or pandemics; or events arising from political events, including terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that disaster recovery
or other plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks. Any failures or disruptions of systems or operations
could impact BB&T’s ability to service its clients, which could adversely affect BB&T’s results of operations
by subjecting BB&T to losses, litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or by requiring the expenditure of significant resources
to correct the failure or disruption.

Significant litigation could have a material adverse effect on
BB&T.

BB&T faces legal risks in its business, and the volume of claims
and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remains high.
Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against BB&T may have material adverse financial effects or cause
significant reputational harm to BB&T, which in turn could seriously harm BB&T’s business prospects.

BB&T faces significant operational and other risks related
to its activities, which could expose it to negative publicity, litigation and/or regulatory action.

BB&T is exposed to many types of risks, including operational,
reputational, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders (including identity and information
theft), unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting
from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from BB&T’s actual
or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, activities
related to asset sales and balance sheet management and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations
in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect BB&T’s ability to attract and keep customers
and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.

Because the nature of the financial services business involves a
high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified.
BB&T’s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase
the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to
detect. BB&T also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond
its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service
to customers and to financial loss or liability. BB&T is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable
to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective
employees as is BB&T) and to the risk that BB&T’s (or its vendors’) business continuity and data security systems
prove to be inadequate.

BB&T relies on other companies to provide certain key components
of its business infrastructure.

Third party vendors provide certain key components of BB&T’s
business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and mutual fund distribution. While BB&T has selected
these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their operations. Any failure by these third parties to perform or provide
agreed upon goods and services for any reason, or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect BB&T’s ability
to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could
also entail significant delay and expense.

BB&T may not be able to successfully integrate bank or nonbank
mergers and acquisitions.

Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations
of BHCs, banks and other nonbank entities BB&T acquires and, as a result, BB&T may not be able to achieve the cost savings
and synergies that it expects will result from such transactions. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain
operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services. Additional
operational savings are dependent upon the integration of the acquired or merged entity’s businesses with BB&T or one
of BB&T’s subsidiaries, the conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products and the standardization of
business practices. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products may result
in the loss of customers, damage to BB&T’s reputation within the financial services industry, operational problems, one-time
costs currently not anticipated or reduced cost savings resulting from such mergers or acquisitions. Annual cost savings in each
such transaction may be materially less than anticipated if the holding company, bank merger or nonbank merger or acquisition is
delayed unexpectedly, the integration of operations is delayed beyond what is anticipated or the conversion to a single set of
data systems is not accomplished on a timely basis.


TableofContents

Difficulty in integrating an acquired company may prevent BB&T
from realizing expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits
from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption
of BB&T’s businesses or the businesses of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect BB&T’s ability
to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative
effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected.
As a result of these and other factors, BB&T could incur losses on acquired assets and increased expenses resulting from the
failure to successfully integrate an acquired company, which could adversely impact its financial condition or results of operations.

BB&T may not be able to successfully implement future information
technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect BB&T’s business operations and profitability.

BB&T invests significant resources in information technology
system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. BB&T may not be able to successfully
implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial
information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities.
Such sanctions could include fines and suspension of trading in BB&T stock, among others. In addition, future system enhancements
could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with
the implementation as well as ongoing operations.

Failure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented
in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact BB&T’s financial condition and results of operations
and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, BB&T may incur significant
training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs
may continue for an extended period of time.

Strategic and Other Risk

BB&T may experience significant competition from new or existing
competitors, which may reduce its customer base or cause it to lower prices for its products and services in order to maintain
market share.

There is intense competition among commercial banks in BB&T’s
market area. In addition, BB&T competes with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations,
credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, the
mutual funds industry, full-service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulations
than BB&T is with respect to the products and services they provide. BB&T’s success depends, in part, on its ability
to adapt its products and services to evolving industry standards and customer expectations. There is increasing pressure to provide
products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce BB&T’s NIM and revenues from its fee-based products and
services.

In addition, the adoption of new technologies by competitors, including
internet banking services, mobile phone applications and advanced ATM functionality could require BB&T to make substantial
expenditures to modify or adapt its existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in BB&T’s
business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. BB&T may not be successful
in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, anticipating or reacting to
consumers’ changing technological preferences or developing and maintaining loyal customers. In addition, BB&T could
lose market share to the shadow banking system or other non-traditional banking organizations.

Some of BB&T’s larger competitors, including certain national
banks that have a significant presence in BB&T’s market area, may have greater capital and resources than BB&T, may
have higher lending limits and may offer products and services not offered by BB&T. Any potential adverse reactions to BB&T’s
financial condition or status in the marketplace, as compared to its competitors, could limit BB&T’s ability to attract
and retain customers and to compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers or to effectively
compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on BB&T’s financial condition and results of operations.


TableofContents

BB&T also experiences competition from nonbank companies inside
and outside of its market area and, in some cases, from companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants.
In particular, technology companies have begun to focus on the financial sector and offer software and products primarily over
the Internet, with an increasing focus on mobile device delivery. These companies generally are not subject to the comparable regulatory
burdens as financial institutions and may accordingly realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable
rates and with greater convenience to the customer. For example, a number of companies offer bill pay and funds transfer services
that allow customers to avoid using a bank. Technology companies are generally positioned and structured to quickly adapt to technological
advances and directly focus resources on implementing those advances. This competition could result in the loss of fee income and
customer deposits and related income. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect BB&T’s
operations, and the Company may be unable to develop competitive and timely new products and services in response. As the pace
of technology and change advance, continuous innovation is expected to exert long-term pressure on the financial services industry.

BB&T may not be able to complete future acquisitions.

BB&T must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions
before it can complete an acquisition of another bank or BHC, including federal and/or state regulatory approvals. In determining
whether to approve a proposed bank or BHC acquisition, bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition
on competition, financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence,
experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities
to be served, including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring
institution in combating money laundering activities and protests from various stakeholders of both BB&T and its acquisition
partner. Also, under the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. regulators must now take systemic risk into account when evaluating whether to approve
a potential acquisition transaction involving a large financial institution like BB&T. BB&T cannot be certain when or if,
or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. In specific cases, BB&T may be required
to sell banks or branches, or take other actions as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. An inability to satisfy other
conditions necessary to consummate an acquisition transaction, such as third-party litigation, a judicial order blocking the transaction
or lack of shareholder approval, could also prevent BB&T from completing an announced acquisition.

Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on BB&T.

The occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tropical
storms, tornados, winter storms and other large scale catastrophes could adversely affect BB&T’s consolidated financial
condition or results of operations. BB&T has operations and customers along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts as well as other parts
of the southeastern United States, which could be adversely impacted by hurricanes and other severe weather in those regions. Unpredictable
natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on BB&T in that such events could materially disrupt its operations
or the ability or willingness of its customers to access the financial services offered by BB&T. Although BB&T carries
insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain catastrophic events, these events could nevertheless reduce BB&T’s earnings
and cause volatility in its financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on BB&T’s
financial condition and/or results of operations.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

BB&T leases its headquarters at 200 West Second Street, Winston-Salem,
North Carolina 27101 and owns or leases other significant office space in the vicinity of its headquarters. BB&T owns free-standing
operations centers, with its primary operations and information technology centers located in various locations in the southeastern
United States. Offices are either owned or operated under long-term leases. BB&T operates retail branches in a number of states,
primarily concentrated in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic United States. See Table 1 for a list of BB&T’s branches
by state. BB&T also operates numerous insurance agencies and other businesses that occupy facilities. Management believes that
the premises are well-located and suitably equipped to serve as financial services facilities. See Note 5 “Premises and Equipment”
in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this report for additional disclosures related to properties
and other fixed assets.

Common Stock, Dividends and Share Repurchases

BB&T’s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent
on earnings from operations, the adequacy of capital and the availability of liquid assets for distribution and is subject to the
FRB not objecting to its capital plan. BB&T’s ability to generate liquid assets for distribution is dependent on the
ability of Branch Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. The payment of cash dividends is an integral part of providing a
competitive return on shareholders’ investments. The Company’s policy is to accomplish this while retaining sufficient
capital to support future growth and to meet regulatory requirements. Management has established a guideline that the common dividend
payout ratio will be between 30% and 50% and the total payout ratio (including dividends and share repurchases) will be between
30% and 80% of basic EPS during normal economic conditions. BB&T’s common dividend payout ratio, computed by dividing
dividends declared per common share by basic EPS, was 40.5% in 2015 compared to 34.4% in 2014. BB&T has paid a cash dividend
to shareholders every year since 1903. BB&T expects common dividend declarations, if declared, to occur in January, April,
July and October with payment dates on or about the first of March, June, September and December. A discussion of dividend restrictions
is included in Note 15 “Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” and in the “Regulatory Considerations” section.

Share Repurchases

BB&T has periodically repurchased shares of its own common stock.
In accordance with North Carolina law, repurchased shares cannot be held as treasury stock, but revert to the status of authorized
and unissued shares upon repurchase.

The Board of Directors had previously granted authority under the
2006 Repurchase Plan for the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of BB&T’s common stock. No shares were repurchased
in connection with the 2006 Repurchase Plan during 2015, 2014, or 2013.

During June 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new plan,
the 2015 Repurchase Plan, to repurchase up to 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Repurchases under the 2015
Repurchase Plan may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The timing and exact amount
of repurchases will be consistent with the Company’s capital plan and subject to various factors, including the Company’s
capital position, liquidity, financial performance, alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions,
and may be suspended at any time. The 2015 Repurchase Plan replaces the 2006 Repurchase Plan and does not have a specified termination
date. No shares were repurchased in connection with the 2015 Repurchase Plan during 2015.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Overview

Overview of Significant Events and Financial Results

Net income available to common shareholders totaled $1.9 billion
for 2015, a 2.4% decline from the prior year. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for 2015 were $2.56, compared to $2.72
for 2014. BB&T’s results of operations for 2015 produced a return on average assets of 1.08% and a return on average
common shareholders’ equity of 8.34% compared to prior year ratios of 1.19% and 9.32%, respectively. These results include
merger-related and restructuring charges of $165 million for 2015, which reflects current year acquisition activity, compared to
$46 million for 2014. Net interest income and noninterest income were both higher following the current year acquisition activity.
Noninterest expense was higher due to increases in headcount and locations, primarily the result of the acquisitions, and the provision
for credit losses increased after an allowance release in the prior year.

Effective January 1, 2015, BB&T adopted new guidance related
to the accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. For periods prior to January 1, 2015, amortization
expense related to qualifying investments in low income housing tax credits was reclassified from other income to provision for
income taxes, and the amount of amortization and tax benefits recognized was revised as a result of the adoption of the proportional
amortization method. See Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional information.

During 2015, BB&T acquired Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., which
provided $18.3 billion in assets, $14.1 billion in deposits and 245 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland.
BB&T also acquired The Bank of Kentucky Financial Corporation, which provided $2.0 billion in assets, $1.6 billion in deposits
and 32 branches in the northern Kentucky/Cincinnati market, and completed the purchase of 41 retail branches in Texas, providing
$1.9 billion in deposits. Additionally, BB&T reached an agreement to acquire National Penn Bancshares, Inc., which had $9.6
billion in assets, $6.7 billion in deposits and 124 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland as of December 31, 2015.

Industry-wide sustained low interest rates represented a significant
challenge for the Company during 2015 and for the past several years. From a NIM perspective, the negative impact associated with
lower yields on loans and securities was partially mitigated by a decrease in funding costs from 0.65% to 0.60%, primarily driven
by a decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and the early extinguishment of certain higher-cost FHLB advances during
2015 and 2014.

BB&T’s revenues for 2015 were $9.8 billion on a FTE basis,
an increase of $384 million compared to 2014. Net interest income on a FTE basis was $221 million higher than the prior year, which
reflects a $187 million increase in interest income and a $34 million decrease in interest expense. Noninterest income increased
$163 million for the year, driven by improvements in FDIC loss share income and higher mortgage banking income.

The provision for credit losses was $428 million, compared to $251
million for the prior year. This increase reflects the stabilization in the rate of credit improvement and prior year loan sales
that generated gains through the release of the related ALLL.

Asset quality improved significantly during 2015 as NPAs declined
$70 million, or 9.0%, compared to 2014. This decline included a $40 million decrease in NPLs primarily due to continuing strong
asset quality within commercial lending, and a $30 million decrease in foreclosed real estate and other property. Net charge-offs
for 2015 were $436 million, compared to $538 million for the prior year. The ratio of the ALLL to net charge-offs was 3.36x for
2015, compared to 2.74x in 2014.

Noninterest expense increased $414 million primarily due to higher
personnel expense and merger-related and restructuring charges, both of which were primarily the result of acquisition activity.
These increases were partially offset by lower loan-related and other expense as the prior year included $118 million of charges
related to the FHA-insured loan origination process.

During 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned a portion of an
earlier ruling related to tax benefits previously disallowed in connection with a financing transaction that resulted in the recognition
of income tax benefits of $107 million.


TableofContents

BB&T’s total assets at December 31, 2015 were $209.9 billion,
an increase of $23.1 billion compared to December 31, 2014. This includes a $15.7 billion increase in loans and leases due to acquisitions
and organic growth. Commercial and industrial loans were up $7.0 billion, CRE-income producing properties loans were up $2.7 billion
and direct retail lending loans were up $3.0 billion. Mortgage loans declined $557 million due to management’s continuing
decision to sell substantially all conforming mortgage loan production and the impact of certain NPL sales, partially offset by
acquisition activity. AFS securities totaled $25.3 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $20.9 billion at December 31, 2014.
HTM securities were $18.5 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to $20.2 billion in the prior year. Goodwill, CDI and other intangible
assets were also higher as the result of acquisitions.

Total deposits at December 31, 2015 were $149.1 billion, an increase
of $20.1 billion from the prior year. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $6.9 billion, interest checking increased $5.1 billion
and money market and savings increased $9.9 billion. Time deposits declined $1.8 billion. The overall growth in lower-cost deposits
reflects acquisition activity and continued organic growth. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for 2015 was 0.24%, a
decline of two basis points compared to the prior year.

Total shareholders’ equity increased $3.0 billion, or 12.2%,
compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by net income in excess of dividends totaling $1.2 billion, combined
with common stock issued in connection with acquisitions. BB&T’s Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital
ratios at December 31, 2015 were 11.8% and 14.3%, respectively, compared to 12.4% and 14.9% at December 31, 2014, respectively.
Common equity tier 1 was 10.3% at December 31, 2015.

On February 24, 2016 BB&T reached an agreement to acquire
CGSC North America Holdings Corporation from Cooper Gay Swett & Crawford.

Key Challenges

BB&T’s business has become more dynamic and complex in
recent years. Consequently, management has annually evaluated and, as necessary, adjusted the Company’s business strategy
in the context of the current operating environment. During this process, management considers the current financial condition
and performance of the Company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective.
The achievement of BB&T’s key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties
and challenges. In the opinion of management, the challenges that are most relevant and likely to have a near term impact on performance
are presented below:

·

Intense competition within the financial services industry given the challenge in growing assets during a period of sustained
low interest rates.

·

New technologies and evolving consumer preferences will put pressure on market share and customer loyalty.

·

Global economic and geopolitical risk, including potential financial system instability and ramifications of sovereign debt
issues.

·

Cost and risk associated with regulatory reform and initiatives and IT projects.

·

Merger integration risk.

In addition, certain other challenges and unforeseen events could
have a near term impact on BB&T’s financial condition and results of operations. See the section titled “Forward-Looking
Statements” for additional examples of such challenges.

Net Interest Income and NIM

Net interest income is BB&T’s primary source of revenue.
Net interest income is influenced by a number of factors, including the volume, mix and maturity of interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid thereon. The difference between rates earned on interest-earning
assets and the cost of funds (with a FTE adjustment made to tax-exempt items to provide comparability with taxable items) is measured
by the NIM.


TableofContents

2015 compared to 2014

For 2015, net interest income on a FTE basis totaled $5.7 billion,
an increase of $221 million or 4.0% compared to the prior year. The increase reflects higher interest income due to acquisitions
and organic loan growth, partially offset by lower yields on new loans and securities and runoff in the loan portfolio acquired
from the FDIC. Interest expense declined, reflecting lower rates and improvement in the mix of funding sources. The average cost
of interest-bearing deposits declined two basis points to 0.24%, reflecting reductions in time deposits and growth in interest
checking and money market and savings. The average cost of long-term debt declined from 2.36% to 2.13%, primarily due to the early
extinguishment of $2.0 billion of higher-cost FHLB advances during the last two years.

The FTE-adjusted NIM is the primary measure used in evaluating the
gross profit margin from the portfolios of earning assets. The FTE-adjusted NIM was 3.32% in 2015 compared with 3.42% in 2014.
The decline in the NIM reflects lower yields on loans and securities, partially offset by the lower funding costs described above.
The average annualized FTE yield for total loans and leases was 4.26% for 2015, compared to 4.42% for the prior year. The decrease
was primarily due to lower yields on new loan originations and the runoff of higher yielding loans acquired from the FDIC, partially
offset by acquisition impact. The FTE yield on the total securities portfolio was 2.36% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared
to 2.45% for the prior year.

The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits for 2015 dropped
to 0.24%, from 0.26% in 2014. This improvement was driven by changes in mix, with time deposits representing a lower percentage
of interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2015.

The rate paid on average short-term borrowings was 0.15% in 2015,
compared to 0.13% in 2014. The average rate on long-term debt during 2015 was 2.13%, compared to 2.36% for the prior year. This
decline reflects the previously mentioned early extinguishment of higher-cost FHLB advances. At December 31, 2015, the targeted
Federal funds rate was a range of 0.25% to 0.50%, following the first rate increase in several years.

2014 compared to 2013

For 2014, net interest income on a FTE basis totaled $5.5 billion,
a decrease of $245 million or 4.3% compared to the prior year. The decrease in net interest income reflects lower yields on new
loans and securities and runoff in the loan portfolio acquired from the FDIC, partially offset by lower funding costs, which declined
$123 million compared to 2013. The improvement in funding costs reflects a six basis point reduction in the average cost of interest-bearing
deposits due to improved mix and a 67 basis point reduction in the average cost of long-term debt primarily due to the early extinguishment
of $1.1 billion of higher-cost FHLB advances during the third quarter and lower rates on new issuances.

The FTE-adjusted NIM was 3.42% in 2014 compared with 3.68% in 2013.
The decline in the NIM reflects lower yields on loans and securities, partially offset by the lower funding costs described above.
The average annualized FTE yield for total loans and leases was 4.42% for 2014, compared to 4.85% for the prior year. The decrease
was primarily due to lower yields on new loan originations and the runoff of higher yielding loans acquired from the FDIC. The
FTE yield on the total securities portfolio was 2.45% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2.51% for the prior year.

The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits for 2014 dropped
to 0.26%, from 0.32% in 2013. This improvement was driven by an 18 basis point reduction in the cost of time deposits.

The rates paid on average short-term borrowings declined to 0.13%
in 2014 from 0.16% in 2013. At December 31, 2014, the targeted Federal funds rate was a range of zero percent to 0.25%. The average
rate on long-term debt during 2014 was 2.36%, compared to 3.03% for the prior year. This decline reflects the previously mentioned
early extinguishment of $1.1 billion of higher-cost FHLB advances and lower rates on new issuances.

The following table sets forth the major components of net interest
income and the related yields and rates, as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus
changes in volumes. Changes attributable to the mix of assets and liabilities have been allocated proportionally between the changes
due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Provision for Credit Losses

2015 compared to 2014

The provision for credit losses was $428 million in 2015, an increase
of $177 million compared to the prior year. The increase in the provision for credit losses reflects allowance releases on loan
sales in the prior year and stabilization in credit trends after an extended period of improvements. The ratio of the ALLL to net
charge-offs was 3.36x for 2015, compared to 2.74x for 2014. During the prior year, loan sales resulted in a combined $66 million
in gains recognized through the release of the ALLL.

Net charge-offs were 0.35% of average loans and leases held for
investment for 2015, compared to 0.46% of average loans and leases held for investment during 2014. Net charge-offs declined $102
million, or 19.0%, with improvement across several loan portfolios led by commercial and industrial loans, which declined $45 million,
and residential mortgage-nonguaranteed, which declined $38 million.

2014 compared to 2013

The provision for credit losses was $251 million in 2014, a decrease
of $341 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in the provision for credit losses reflects continued improvement in credit
trends and outlook, as net charge-offs in 2014 decreased 32.1% compared to the prior year. Improving credit conditions also resulted
in an increase in the ratio of the ALLL to net charge-offs, which increased to 2.74x for 2014, compared to 2.19x for 2013.

During 2014, approximately $550 million of residential mortgage
loans that were primarily performing TDRs and approximately $140 million of residential mortgage loans that were primarily nonperforming
were sold at a pre-tax gain of $42 million and $24 million, respectively. Both of these gains were recognized as a reduction to
the provision for credit losses.

Net charge-offs were 0.46% of average loans and leases held for
investment for 2014, compared to 0.69% of average loans and leases held for investment during 2013. Net charge-offs declined $254
million, or 32.1%, with improvement across most loan portfolios led by commercial and industrial loans, which declined $112 million
compared to 2013. Net charge-offs in other lending subsidiaries were $15 million higher primarily due to a process change that
resulted in the accelerated recognition of charge-offs in the nonprime automobile lending portfolio.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to BB&T’s
financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to further reduce BB&T’s reliance on traditional
spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing
interest rates.

2015 compared to 2014

Noninterest income was a record $4.0 billion for 2015, an increase
of $163 million compared to 2014. This increase was driven by improved FDIC loss share income, higher mortgage banking income and
higher operating lease income, partially offset by lower insurance income and lower other income.

FDIC loss share income improved by $90 million, primarily due to
a $58 million reduction in negative accretion related to credit losses on covered loans and a $20 million change in the offset
to the provision for covered loans. See “Acquired from the FDIC and FDIC Loss Share Receivable/Payable” for additional
information.

Mortgage banking income increased $60 million, primarily due to
higher volume and $17 million of higher MSR valuation adjustments.

Operating lease income increased $29 million, primarily due to a
larger leasing portfolio size as this business has continued to demonstrate steady growth.

Income from BB&T’s insurance agency/brokerage operations
was the largest source of noninterest income in 2015. Insurance income totaled $1.6 billion for 2015, a decline of $47 million
compared to 2014. The second quarter sale of American Coastal resulted in a $79 million decline in insurance income, which was
partially offset by higher volume in the property and casualty business.

Other income totaled $326 million for 2015, a decline of $23 million
from 2014. This decline is primarily due to the $26 million loss on sale of American Coastal during the second quarter of 2015
and $18 million of lower income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits (which is offset in personnel expense).
These declines were partially offset by higher partnerships and other investment income, which was the result of an opportunistic
sale that resulted in a $28 million gain during the third quarter of 2015.

2014 compared to 2013

Noninterest income was $3.9 billion for 2014, compared to $4.0 billion
for 2013. This decrease was driven by declines in mortgage banking income, FDIC loss share income, net securities gains and other
income, partially offset by growth in insurance income.

Income from BB&T’s insurance agency/brokerage operations
was the largest source of noninterest income in 2014. Insurance income was $1.6 billion, up $126 million compared to 2013, as increased
volume and improving market conditions drove broad-based increases across the insurance business. This growth was led by a $95
million increase in property and casualty commissions and a $17 million increase in contingent insurance commissions.


TableofContents

Mortgage banking income totaled
$395 million in 2014, a decrease of $170 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in mortgage banking income includes a
$182 million decrease in residential mortgage production revenues primarily due to decreases in the volume and margins on loan
sales, which have come under pressure due to increased competition and sustained low interest rates. The decline also reflects
an $18 million reduction in fees primarily due to a reduction in volume. These declines were partially offset by increased servicing
income due to a larger servicing portfolio as well as an increase in derivative income.

Net securities gains declined $54 million as the prior year contained
a $46 million gain on the sale of GNMA securities. FDIC loss share income, net, was $50 million worse than 2013, primarily due
to a $29 million change in the offset to the provision for covered loans, which was a benefit in 2014 due to improved credit quality
on the acquired loans.

Trust and investment advisory revenues increased $21 million to
a record $221 million, primarily the result of higher investment advisory revenues during the current year. Other income decreased
$96 million in 2014, primarily due to a $31 million gain on the sale of a consumer lending subsidiary in 2013, a $24 million decrease
in income from assets related to certain post-employment benefits, which is offset in personnel expense, and an $8 million decrease
in letter of credit fees. These declines and other smaller declines were partially offset by a $19 million increase in leasing
income.

2015 compared to 2014

Noninterest expense totaled $6.3 billion for 2015, an increase of
$414 million from 2014. This increase was driven by higher personnel expense, merger-related and restructuring charges and loss
on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by lower loan-related expense.

Personnel expense is the largest component of noninterest expense
and includes salaries, wages and incentives, as well as pension and other employee benefit costs. Personnel expense totaled $3.5
billion, a $289 million increase compared to 2014. This increase was driven by a $114 million increase in salaries, which was primarily
due to additional headcount from acquisitions. Personnel expense also increased due to a $74 million increase in pension expense
that reflects higher amortization, service and interest costs, partially offset by the estimated return on higher plan assets.
Additionally, personnel expense reflects a $50 million increase in employee medical and insurance benefits and a $32 million increase
in incentives.

Merger-related and restructuring charges totaled $165 million, an
increase of $119 million compared to 2014. This increase was primarily related to the Susquehanna acquisition, with additional
amounts related to The Bank of Kentucky and the planned acquisition of National Penn.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $172 million for 2015,
compared to $122 million for 2014. The combined debt extinguishments for the two years totaled $2.0 billion of FHLB advances with
a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%.


TableofContents

Occupancy and equipment expense totaled $708 million for 2015, compared
to $682 million for 2014. The increase reflects the acquisition activity occurring during the year.

Loan-related expense totaled $150 million for 2015, a decrease of
$117 million compared to the prior year. This decrease is largely the result of lower claims and chargeoffs in the current year,
as well as charges recorded in the prior year of $33 million related to the FHA-insured loan origination process and $27 million
related to a review of mortgage lending processes.

2014 compared to 2013

Personnel expense totaled $3.2 billion, a decrease of $113 million
compared to 2013. This decline was driven by a $110 million reduction in qualified pension plan expense, primarily due to a higher
expected return on plan assets and a change in the actuarial discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation as
of the beginning of the year that resulted in reduced amortization expense during 2014.

Professional services expense totaled $139 million, a decrease of
$50 million compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven by a reduction in legal fees as well as services associated with
regulatory initiatives. Regulatory charges totaled $106 million for 2014, a decline of $37 million compared to 2013, which primarily
reflects a reduction in FDIC insurance due to long-term debt issuances and improved credit conditions.

Loan-related expense totaled $267 million for 2014, an increase
of $79 million compared to the prior year. This increase includes a $33 million mortgage loan indemnification reserve adjustment,
which represents an increase in estimated losses that may be incurred on FHA-insured mortgage loans that have not yet defaulted,
and a mortgage reserve adjustment of $27 million related to a review of mortgage lending processes.

Outside IT services totaled $115 million during 2014, compared to
$89 million for 2013. This increase was due to third-party costs associated with the new ERP and commercial loan systems.

A loss on early extinguishment of debt of $122 million was recorded
during 2014 in connection with the early termination of $1.1 billion of higher cost FHLB advances. The transaction occurred during
the third quarter of 2014 and had a beneficial impact to net interest income for the remainder of the year.

Other expense was $890 million for 2014, an increase of $72 million
compared to 2013. During June 2014, BB&T received notice from the HUD-OIG that BB&T had been selected for an audit/survey
to assess BB&T's compliance with FHA loan origination and quality control requirements. In late 2014 and in 2015, BB&T
received subpoenas from the HUD-OIG and the Department of Justice seeking additional information regarding its lending practices
in connection with loans insured by the FHA. BB&T is cooperating with the investigation. While the outcome of the investigation
is unknown and neither the Department of Justice nor the HUD-OIG has asserted any claims, similar reviews and related matters with
other financial institutions have resulted in cash settlements and other remedial actions. BB&T identified a potential exposure
related to losses incurred by the FHA on defaulted loans that ranges from $25 million to $105 million and recognized an $85 million
charge during 2014. The income statement impact of this adjustment was included in other expense on the Consolidated Statements
of lncome. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and the estimates of this exposure are subject to the application
of significant judgment and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.

The increase in other expense also includes a $17 million increase
in depreciation related to operating leases. These increases were partially offset by a $15 million favorable franchise tax adjustment
and a decline in expense due to the prior year $11 million write-down of owned real estate.

Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges

BB&T has incurred certain merger-related and restructuring charges,
which are reflected in BB&T’s Consolidated Statements of Income as a category of noninterest expense. Merger-related
and restructuring expenses or credits include:

·

severance and personnel-related costs or credits, which typically occur in corporate support
and data processing functions;

·

occupancy and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease
terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment;

·

professional services, which relate to investment banking advisory fees and other consulting
services pertaining to the transaction;


TableofContents

·

systems conversion and related charges, which represent costs to integrate the acquired entity’s
information technology systems; and

·

other merger-related and restructuring charges or credits, which include expenses necessary to
convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related to the acquisitions,
asset and supply inventory write-offs, and other similar charges.

Merger-related and restructuring accruals are established when the
costs are incurred or once all requirements for a plan to dispose of certain business functions have been approved by management.
In general, a major portion of accrued costs are utilized in conjunction with or immediately following the systems conversion,
when most of the duplicate positions are eliminated and the terminated employees begin to receive severance. Other accruals are
utilized over time based on the sale, closing or disposal of duplicate facilities or equipment or the expiration of lease contracts.
Merger and restructuring accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. The remaining accruals at December 31,
2015 are generally expected to be utilized within one year, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire later.

The following table presents a summary of activity with respect to merger-related and restructuring accruals:

Provision for Income Taxes

BB&T’s provision for income taxes totaled $794 million,
$921 million and $1.6 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. BB&T’s effective tax rates for the years ended 2015,
2014 and 2013 were 27.2%, 29.5% and 47.3%, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rates during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were
primarily due to adjustments for uncertain tax positions as discussed below.

During 2010, BB&T received an IRS statutory notice of deficiency
for tax years 2002-2007 asserting a liability for taxes, penalties and interest of approximately $892 million related to the disallowance
of foreign tax credits and other deductions claimed by a subsidiary in connection with a financing transaction. BB&T paid the
disputed tax, penalties and interest during 2010 and filed a lawsuit seeking a refund in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. During
2013, the court denied the refund claim, and BB&T recorded $516 million of income tax charges. BB&T appealed the decision
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 14, 2015, the appeals court overturned a portion of the earlier ruling,
resulting in the recognition of income tax benefits of $107 million during the second quarter of 2015. The remainder of the decision
was affirmed. On September 29, 2015, BB&T filed a petition requesting the case be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court,

which
has not rendered a decision on whether it will hear the case.

BB&T has extended credit to and invested in the obligations
of states and municipalities and their agencies and has made other investments and loans that produce tax-exempt income. The income
generated from these investments, together with certain other transactions that have favorable tax treatment, have reduced BB&T’s
overall effective tax rate from the statutory rate in all periods presented.

Refer to Note 12 “Income Taxes” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory tax rate and a discussion
of uncertain tax positions and other tax matters.

Segment Results

See Note 20 “Operating Segments” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional disclosures related to BB&T’s operating segments, the
internal accounting and reporting practices used to manage these segments and financial disclosures for these segments.

Fluctuations in noninterest income and noninterest expense incurred
directly by the segments are more fully discussed in the “Noninterest Income” and “Noninterest Expense”
sections above.

2015 compared to 2014

Community Banking

Community Banking had a network of 2,139 banking offices at the
end of 2015, an increase of 300 offices compared to December 31, 2014. The increase in offices was primarily driven by the acquisition
of 41 branches in Texas, 32 branches with the acquisition of The Bank of Kentucky and 245 branches with the acquisition of Susquehanna
Bancshares, partially offset by the consolidation of nearby financial centers and the closure of certain lower volume branches
within the BB&T branch network.

Community Banking net income was $978 million in 2015, an increase
of $68 million, or 7.5%, compared to 2014. Net income results include the impact of the current year acquisitions as described
previously.

Segment net interest income increased $159 million to $3.1 billion,
primarily driven by growth in commercial loans and direct retail loans due to organic growth and the acquisitions, partially offset
by lower interest rates on new loans and lower funding spreads on deposits.

Noninterest income decreased $18 million driven by lower service
charges on deposits, international factoring commissions and letter of credit fees. Intersegment net referral fee income increased
$15 million driven by higher loan referrals to the Residential Mortgage Banking segment and higher capital markets referrals to
the Financial Services segment.

The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $56 million
as a result of lower commercial and retail loan net charge-offs. Noninterest expense increased $89 million driven by higher salary,
incentive, pension and franchise tax expense as well as higher merger-related charges. The increase in salary expense reflects
the acquisition activity. Allocated corporate expense increased $21 million driven by internal business initiatives.

Residential Mortgage Banking

Residential Mortgage Banking net income was $244 million in 2015,
an increase of $40 million, or 19.6%, compared to 2014. Mortgage originations totaled $18.1 billion in 2015, an increase of $706
million compared to $17.4 billion in 2014. BB&T’s residential mortgage servicing portfolio, which includes both retained
loans and loans serviced for others, totaled $122.2 billion at the end of 2015, compared to $122.3 billion at December 31, 2014.

Segment net interest income decreased $46 million to $452 million,
primarily the result of lower loans HFI balances reflecting the current strategy of selling substantially all conforming mortgage
loan production, partially offset by higher credit spreads. Noninterest income increased $45 million, driven by higher gains on
residential mortgage loan production and sales and an increase in net MSR income, primarily due to improved MSR hedging results.

The allocated provision for credit losses reflected a charge of
$9 million in 2015, compared to a benefit of $107 million in 2014, partially attributable to stabilization in the rate of improvement
in credit trends. Earlier period results reflect the impact of loan sales that generated a combined $66 million in gains through
the release of the related ALLL. Noninterest expense decreased $184 million, primarily due to prior-year adjustments totaling $118
million relating to the previously discussed FHA-insured loan exposures and a $27 million prior-year charge related to a review
of mortgage processes. The decrease in noninterest expense was also partially attributable to lower costs associated with repurchased
loans.

Dealer Financial Services

Dealer Financial Services net income was $180 million in 2015, a
decrease of $3 million, or 1.6%, compared to 2014.


TableofContents

Segment net interest income increased $53 million to $728 million,
primarily driven by growth in the Dealer Finance and Regional Acceptance loan portfolios, the inclusion of dealer floor plan loans
in the segment results beginning in the first quarter of 2015 and the acquisition of Susquehanna’s consumer auto leasing
business.

The allocated provision for credit losses increased $17 million,
primarily due to higher charge-offs. Noninterest expense increased $37 million driven by higher personnel, professional services,
loan processing and other expenses.

Dealer Financial Services grew average loans by $911 million, or
7.1%, compared to 2014 as a result of strong growth in the prime and nonprime auto lending businesses and the acquisition of Susquehanna’s
consumer auto leasing business.

Specialized Lending

Specialized Lending net income was $268 million in 2015, an increase
of $11 million, or 4.3%, compared to 2014.

Segment net interest income increased $33 million to $465 million,
driven by strong growth in small ticket consumer loans and the acquisition of Susquehanna’s small business equipment finance
portfolio, partially offset by lower rates on new loans. Noninterest income increased $39 million driven by higher commercial mortgage
and operating lease income.

The allocated provision for credit losses increased $9 million,
primarily due to higher net charge-offs in the small ticket consumer and commercial finance loan portfolios. Noninterest expense
increased $45 million, primarily due to higher personnel expense and higher depreciation of property under operating leases.

Specialized Lending grew average loans by $2.0 billion, or 12.7%,
compared to 2014 as a result of strong growth in small ticket consumer, commercial mortgage and governmental finance loans and
the acquisition of the small business equipment finance portfolio.

Insurance Services

Insurance Services net income was $182 million in 2015, a decrease
of $51 million, or 21.9%, compared to 2014.

Insurance Service’s noninterest income of $1.6 billion decreased
$55 million, which primarily reflects lower direct commercial property and casualty insurance premiums due to the previously discussed
sale of American Coastal, partially offset by higher new and renewal commercial property and casualty insurance business.

Noninterest expense increased $2 million driven by higher salary,
employee insurance and pension expense as well as higher merger-related charges, partially offset by lower business referral and
insurance claims expense. Allocated corporate expenses increased $13 million primarily due to the centralization of certain corporate
support functions during mid-2014.

Financial Services

Financial Services net income was $319 million in 2015, an increase
of $37 million, or 13.1%, compared to 2014.

Segment net interest income increased $80 million to $526 million,
driven by Corporate Banking and BB&T Wealth loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower rates on new loans. Noninterest
income increased $68 million as a result of higher investment commissions and brokerage fees, trust and investment advisory fees,
commercial unused commitment fees and income from SBIC private equity investments. Client invested assets totaled $130.6 billion
as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $11.7 billion, or 9.8%, compared to 2014.

The allocated provision for credit losses increased $40 million
as a result of the Corporate Banking loan growth, portfolio mix and risk expectations related to the oil and energy sector. Noninterest
expense increased $46 million compared to 2014, driven by higher salary, incentive, pension and professional services expense.

Financial Services continues to generate significant loan growth
through expanded lending strategies, with Corporate Banking’s average loan balances increasing $2.6 billion, or 28.4%, compared
to 2014, while BB&T Wealth’s average loan balances increased $367 million, or 32.7%. BB&T Wealth also grew transaction
account balances by $595 million, or 21.5%, and money market and savings balances by $974 million, or 14.5%, compared to 2014,
partially attributable to the ongoing identification and servicing of wealth clients in the Community Bank.


TableofContents

Other, Treasury & Corporate

Other, Treasury & Corporate generated a net loss of $48 million
in 2015, compared to net income of $137 million in 2014.

Segment net interest income decreased $62 million to $339 million,
driven by lower average PCI loan balances as well as lower yields on the securities portfolio, partially offset by higher funding
spreads on deposits. Noninterest income increased $79 million, primarily due to improved FDIC loss share income, partially offset
by the loss on the previously discussed sale of American Coastal.

The allocated provision for credit losses reflected a benefit of
$15 million in 2015, compared to a benefit of $66 million in 2014, primarily due to a release in the RUFC in the earlier period
driven by improvements related to the mix of unfunded lending exposures and a lower provision benefit for PCI loans attributable
to improvements in credit quality in the earlier period.

Noninterest expense increased $365 million, driven by higher salary,
employee insurance and pension expense, partially attributable to the Susquehanna acquisition, as well as higher IT professional
services and software expense, franchise taxes and merger-related charges. In addition, noninterest expense for the current year
includes the previously discussed $172 million loss on early extinguishment of FHLB advances, compared to a similar loss of $122
million in the prior year. Intersegment net referral fee expenses decreased $22 million driven largely by higher mortgage loan
referrals shared by other segments. Amortization of intangibles increased $25 million primarily due to core deposit intangible
amortization for acquisitions occurring during 2015. Allocated corporate expense decreased $53 million compared to the earlier
period as a result of higher expense allocations to the other segments related to internal business initiatives and the continued
centralization of certain support functions into the respective allocated corporate centers.

2014 compared to 2013

Community Banking

Community Banking had a network of 1,839 banking offices at the
end of 2014, an increase of 14 offices compared to December 31, 2013. During the second quarter of 2014, BB&T completed the
acquisition of 21 branches in Texas, which included $1.2 billion in deposits and $112 million in loans. The increase in offices
was primarily driven by the acquisition, partially offset by the closure of certain lower volume branches.

Community Banking net income was $910 million in 2014, an increase
of $26 million, or 2.9%, compared to 2013. Segment net interest income totaled $2.9 billion, a decrease of $134 million compared
to 2013, primarily due to lower yields on new loans and lower funding spreads earned on deposits, partially offset by loan and
noninterest-bearing deposit growth. Noninterest income of $1.2 billion increased $4 million, primarily due to higher service charges
on deposits, checkcard fees and bankcard fees.

The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $156 million
driven by lower business and consumer loan charge-offs, partially offset by stabilization in loss factors. Noninterest expense
totaled $1.4 billion for 2014. The $145 million decrease was primarily attributable to lower personnel, occupancy and equipment
and professional services expense and lower restructuring charges. Intersegment net referral fees decreased $58 million driven
by lower mortgage banking referrals. Allocated corporate expenses increased $81 million, primarily driven by internal business
initiatives, including the implementation of the ERP system.

Residential Mortgage Banking

Residential Mortgage Banking net income was $204 million in 2014,
a decrease of $179 million, or 46.7%, compared to 2013. Mortgage originations totaled $17.4 billion in 2014, a decrease of $14.2
billion compared to $31.6 billion in 2013. BB&T’s residential mortgage servicing portfolio, which includes both retained
loans and loans serviced for others, totaled $122.3 billion at the end of 2014, compared to $121.2 billion at the end of 2013.

Segment net interest income decreased $87 million to $498 million,
primarily the result of lower average loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $171 million driven by lower gains on residential
mortgage loan sales due to lower origination volume and tighter pricing due to competitive factors. This decrease was partially
offset by an increase in net servicing income of $31 million, primarily due to slower prepayment speeds and a $2.8 billion, or
3.2%, increase in the investor-owned servicing portfolio.


TableofContents

The allocated provision for credit losses was a benefit of $107
million in 2014, compared to expense of $12 million in 2013, reflecting the benefit of the previously discussed sales of residential
mortgage loans during 2014 and a decrease in loan balances consistent with the current strategy of selling substantially all conforming
mortgage loan production. Noninterest expense increased $141 million, which primarily reflects a $27 million charge in the fourth
quarter of 2014 related to the previously discussed ongoing review of mortgage processes, as well as adjustments in the second
quarter of 2014 totaling $118 million related to the previously discussed FHA-insured loan exposures.

Dealer Financial Services

Dealer Financial Services net income was $183 million in 2014, a
decrease of $21 million, or 10.3%, compared to 2013.

The allocated provision for credit losses increased $23 million
primarily due to higher charge-offs in the nonprime automobile loan portfolio as credit trends in that portfolio continue to normalize.
Noninterest expense increased $8 million, driven by higher personnel expense, primarily related to Regional Acceptance Corporation’s
geographic expansion, and operating charge-offs.

Dealer Financial Services grew average loans by $1.1 billion, or
10.5%, compared to 2013 as a result of strong growth in both the prime and nonprime auto lending businesses.

Specialized Lending

Specialized Lending net income was $257 million in 2014, a decrease
of $16 million, or 5.9%, compared to 2013.

Segment net interest income decreased $120 million to $432 million,
which primarily reflects the sale of a consumer lending subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2013 and lower credit spreads on
loans earned during 2014. Noninterest income increased $10 million driven by higher operating lease income.

The sale of the specialized lending subsidiary also had a beneficial
impact on the allocated provision for credit losses, which decreased $46 million. Noninterest expense decreased $34 million driven
by lower personnel, occupancy and equipment, loan processing and professional services expense.

Small ticket consumer finance, equipment finance, governmental finance
and commercial mortgage experienced strong loan growth compared to 2013.

Insurance Services

Insurance Services net income was $233 million in 2014, an increase
of $46 million, or 24.6%, compared to 2013.

Insurance Services’ noninterest income of $1.7 billion increased
$128 million, primarily due to increased commissions on new and renewal property and casualty business, higher performance-based
commissions and an increase in employee benefit commissions. Noninterest expense increased $54 million driven by higher salaries,
performance-based incentives, operating charge-offs and business referral expense.

Financial Services

Financial Services net income was $282 million in 2014, a decrease
of $23 million, or 7.5%, compared to 2013.

Noninterest income increased $22 million, primarily due to higher
trust, investment advisory and investment banking income. Client invested assets totaled $119.0 billion as of December 31, 2014,
an increase of $7.8 billion, or 7.0%, compared to 2013.

The allocated provision for credit losses increased $7 million compared
to the prior year as a result of growth in the Corporate Banking and BB&T Wealth loan portfolios. Noninterest expense increased
$30 million, primarily due to higher personnel expense, operating charge-offs, sub-advisory fees and occupancy and equipment expense.
Allocated corporate expenses increased $19 million, primarily driven by internal business initiatives and growth in the segment.

Financial Services continued to generate significant loan growth
through expanded lending strategies. Corporate Banking’s average loan balances increased $1.7 billion, or 23.4%, compared
to 2013, while BB&T Wealth’s average loan balances increased $229 million, or 25.6%. BB&T Wealth also grew transaction
account balances by $438 million, or 18.8%, and money market and savings balances by $534 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2013.


TableofContents

Other, Treasury & Corporate

Other, Treasury & Corporate net income was $137 million in 2014
compared to a net loss of $506 million in 2013. Results in the prior year include $516 million in adjustments for uncertain income
tax positions as previously discussed.

Segment net interest income increased $103 million to $401 million,
primarily due to an increase in the investment portfolio, lower funding credits on deposits allocated to Community Banking and
Financial Services and lower corporate borrowing costs, partially offset by runoff in the PCI loan portfolio.

Noninterest income decreased $170 million primarily due to lower
securities gains in the investment portfolio, lower FDIC loss share income, the sale of a consumer lending subsidiary during the
fourth quarter of 2013 and lower income from assets related to certain post-employment benefits.

The allocated provision for credit losses was a benefit of $66 million
compared to a benefit of $16 million in 2013. Results from 2014 included a $29 million benefit for loans acquired from the FDIC
and a $29 million reduction in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments driven by improvements related to the mix of lines
of credit, letters of credit, and bankers’ acceptances. Noninterest expense increased $36 million, primarily due to $122
million in expense related to early extinguishment of FHLB debt, and higher outside IT services and merger-related expense, partially
offset by lower personnel, professional services and tax and license expense. Intersegment net referral fee expense decreased $59
million as a result of a lower level of mortgage banking referral income that was allocated to both Community Banking and Financial
Services.

Analysis of Financial Condition

Investment Activities

BB&T’s board-approved investment policy is carried out
by the MRLCC, which meets regularly to review the economic environment and establish investment strategies. The MRLCC also has
much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the “Market Risk Management” section in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” herein.

Investment strategies are reviewed by the MRLCC based on the interest
rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest rate sensitivity
of the Company. In general, the goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets
to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities
to secure public funds, trust deposits as prescribed by law and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn the maximum return on
funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i) and (ii).

Branch Bank invests in securities allowable under bank regulations.
These securities may include obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, GSEs (including MBS), bank eligible obligations
of any state or political subdivision, non-agency MBS, structured notes, bank eligible corporate obligations (including corporate
debentures), commercial paper, negotiable CDs, bankers acceptances, mutual funds and limited types of equity securities. Branch
Bank also may deal in securities subject to the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. BB&T’s full-service brokerage
and investment banking subsidiary engages in the underwriting, trading and sales of equity and debt securities subject to the risk
management policies of the Company.

The securities portfolio totaled $43.8 billion at December 31, 2015,
compared to $41.1 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by higher AFS portfolio balances, primarily due to purchases
of agency MBS and U.S. Treasury securities during the year.

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 12.4% of the securities portfolio
was variable rate, compared to 14.0% as of December 31, 2014. The effective duration of the securities portfolio was 4.0 years
at December 31, 2015, compared to 3.9 years at the end of 2014. The duration of the securities portfolio excludes equity securities,
auction rate securities, and certain non-agency MBS acquired from the FDIC.

Agency MBS represented 73.7% of the total securities portfolio at
year-end 2015, compared to 71.1% as of prior year end. As of December 31, 2015, the AFS securities portfolio also includes $1.1
billion of securities that were acquired from the FDIC as part of the Colonial acquisition. Effective October 1, 2014, securities
subject to the commercial loss sharing agreement with the FDIC related to the Colonial acquisition were no longer subject to loss
sharing; however, any gains on the sale of these securities through September 30, 2017 would be shared with the FDIC. Since these
securities are in a significant unrealized gain position, they are effectively covered as any declines in the unrealized gains
of the securities down to a contractually specified amount would reduce the liability to the FDIC at the applicable percentage.
Securities acquired from the FDIC consisted of $768 million of non-agency MBS and $296 million of states and political subdivisions
securities as of December 31, 2015.

BB&T transferred $517 million of HTM securities to AFS during
the third quarter of 2015. These securities, which were sold by the end of the third quarter, represented investments in student
loans for which there was a significant increase in risk weighting as a result of the implementation of Basel III.

BB&T recognized $4 million in OTTI charges for 2015 and $6 million
in OTTI charges for 2014.

Refer to Note 3 “Securities” in the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional disclosures related to the evaluation of securities for OTTI.

(2)

For purposes of the maturity table, MBS, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity. The expected life of MBS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the underlying mortgage loans.

Lending Activities

The primary goal of the BB&T lending function is to help clients
achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the Company. Management
believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong, profitable client relationships over time, with BB&T
becoming an important contributor to the prosperity and well-being of its clients. In addition to the importance placed on client
knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, BB&T’s lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent
company-wide credit culture and an in-depth local market knowledge. Furthermore, the Company employs strict underwriting criteria
governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration.
In this context, BB&T strives to meet the credit needs of clients in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan
profitability, loan growth and loan quality.

Average loans held for investment for the fourth quarter of 2015
were $134.8 billion, up $4.3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding acquisitions (which comprises Susquehanna,
The Bank of Kentucky, both branch acquisitions in Texas and BankAtlantic), average loans held for investment were up approximately
2.0% on an annualized basis.

Average commercial and industrial loans increased $1.6 billion during
the fourth quarter of 2015. Approximately $740 million of the increase was the result of acquisitions while the remaining increase
primarily reflects continued growth in large corporate lending. Average commercial real estate – income producing properties
loans increased $750 million and average commercial real estate – construction and development loans increased $264 million,
with the majority of both of these increases being attributable to acquisitions. Dealer floor plan average loans, which were not
significantly impacted by acquisition activity, were up $108 million or 40.6% annualized, due to strong organic growth.

Direct retail lending average loans increased $970 million; approximately
$735 million of the growth was due to acquisitions. Other lending subsidiaries average loans increased $444 million, with approximately
half of the increase due to acquisitions.

Excluding acquisition activity, average sales finance loans declined
approximately $400 million, which is partially due to dealer pricing structure changes implemented during the third quarter. Average
residential mortgage loans decreased approximately $430 million excluding acquisitions, which reflects the continued strategy to
sell conforming residential mortgage loan production.

The following table excludes sales finance and retail other lending
subsidiaries loans as the substantial majority of those loans have fixed interest rates:

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 3.3% of the outstanding balance
of variable rate residential mortgage loans is currently in an interest-only phase. Approximately 94.0% of these balances will
begin amortizing within the next three years. Variable rate residential mortgage loans typically reset every 12 months beginning
after a 3 to 10 year fixed period, with an annual cap on rate changes ranging from 2.0% to 6.0%.

As of December 31, 2015, the direct retail lending portfolio includes
$6.7 billion of home equity lines. Approximately 74.9% of the outstanding balance of variable rate home equity lines is currently
in the interest-only phase. Approximately 8.8% of these balances will begin scheduled amortization within the next three years.
Variable rate home equity lines typically reset on a monthly basis. Variable rate home equity loans were immaterial as of December
31, 2015.

BB&T monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines
secured by second liens similar to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary
ALLL. BB&T also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether BB&T or another financial institution, has initiated
foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, BB&T obtains
valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually
thereafter.

BB&T has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of
the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by BB&T. As a result, using migration assumptions that are based
on historical experience and adjusted for current trends, BB&T estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first
lien is delinquent and adjusts the ALLL to reflect the increased risk of loss on these credits. Finally, BB&T also provides
additional reserves to second lien positions when the estimated combined current loan to value ratio for the credit exceeds 100%.
As of December 31, 2015, BB&T held or serviced the first lien on 32.8% of its second lien positions.

Scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which
the payment is due. Determinations of maturities are based on contract terms. BB&T’s credit policy typically does not
permit automatic renewal of loans. At the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the customer generally must
request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions
negotiated at that time.

BB&T lends to a diverse customer base that is substantially
located within the Company’s primary market area. At the same time, the loan portfolio is geographically dispersed throughout
BB&T’s branch network to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. Refer to the
“Risk Management” section herein for a discussion of each of the loan portfolios and the credit risk management policies
used to manage the portfolios.

During the first quarter of 2014, $8.3 billion of loans were transferred from direct retail lending to residential mortgage.

Total loans and leases were $137.0 billion at year-end 2015, an
increase of $15.7 billion compared to the balance at year-end 2014. This increase reflects broad-based loan growth along with the
impact of acquisitions, which contributed $14.2 billion in loans as of the respective acquisition dates. Commercial and industrial
loans were up $7.0 billion, direct retail lending loans were up $3.0 billion, CRE-income producing properties loans were up $2.7
billion and other lending subsidiaries loans were up $2.1 billion. A $557 million decline in residential mortgage balances reflects
the continued strategy to sell conforming residential mortgage loan production.

The increase in commercial and industrial loans reflects the previously
mentioned acquisition activity as well as solid growth from large corporate clients, which typically have strong credit profiles
and therefore put downward pressure on pricing. The yield on commercial and industrial loans declined to 3.21% in 2015 from 3.35%
in 2014.

The PCI loan portfolio, which totaled $1.1 billion at December 31,
2015, continued to runoff during the year, partially offset by the addition of $403 million of PCI loans in connection with the
Susquehanna acquisition.

The majority of BB&T’s loans are with clients in domestic
market areas, which are primarily concentrated in the southeastern United States. International loans were immaterial as of December
31, 2015 and 2014.

The following tables summarize the loan portfolio based on regulatory
classifications, which focuses on the underlying loan collateral, and differs from internal classifications presented herein that
focus on the primary purpose of the loan.

Asset Quality

The following discussion includes PCI loans, which are considered
performing due to the application of the expected cash flows method and totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015 and $1.2 billion
in the prior year. Foreclosed real estate acquired from the FDIC totaled $26 million and $56 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.

NPAs, which include foreclosed real estate, repossessions and NPLs,
totaled $712 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $782 million at December 31, 2014. The decline in NPAs of $70 million was
driven by decreases of $40 million in NPLs and $30 million in foreclosed real estate and other property.

The decline in NPLs was led by decreases in CRE-income producing
properties and CRE-construction and development NPLs of $36 million and $13 million, respectively, due to continued improvement
in credit quality.

.

NPAs as a percentage of loans and leases plus foreclosed property
were 0.52% at December 31, 2015 compared with 0.65% at December 31, 2014.

The following tables summarize asset quality information for the
past five years. As more fully described below, this information has been adjusted to exclude certain components:

·

BB&T has recorded certain amounts related to government guaranteed GNMA mortgage loans that
BB&T has the option, but not the obligation, to repurchase and has effectively regained control. These amounts are reported
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets but have been excluded from the asset quality disclosures, as management believes they result
in distortion of the reported metrics. The amount of government guaranteed GNMA mortgage loans that have been excluded are noted
in the footnotes to Table 19.

·

In addition, BB&T has concluded that the inclusion of PCI in “Loans 90 days or more
past due and still accruing as a percentage of total loans and leases” may result in significant distortion to this ratio.
The inclusion of these loans could result in a lack of comparability across quarters or years, and could negatively impact comparability
with other portfolios that were not impacted by acquisition accounting. BB&T believes that the presentation of this asset quality
measure excluding PCI provides additional perspective into underlying trends related to the quality of its loan portfolio. Accordingly,
the asset quality measures in Table 20 present asset quality information on a consolidated basis as well as “Loans 90 days
or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of total loans and leases” excluding PCI.

interest, excluding government guaranteed GNMA mortgage loans, totaled $312 million at December 31, 2015, compared with $535 million
at year-end 2014, a decline of $223 million. This reduction reflects overall continued improvement in credit quality. Loans 30-89
days past due, excluding government guaranteed GNMA mortgage loans, totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $132
million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher loan balances.

Net charge-offs for 2011 include $236 million related to BB&T’s NPA disposition strategy. In connection with this
strategy, approximately $271 million of problem loans were transferred from loans HFI to LHFS in 2011. The disposition of all such
loans was complete as of December 31, 2011.

(3)

These asset quality ratios have been adjusted to remove the impact of PCI assets. Appropriate adjustments to the numerator
and denominator have been reflected in the calculation of these ratios.

Potential problem loans include loans on nonaccrual status or past
due as disclosed in Table 19. In addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard
performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. Refer to Note 4 “Loans and ACL” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.

TDRs generally occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected
to experience, financial difficulties in the near-term. As a result, BB&T will work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties,
and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. To facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that
would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR. Refer to Note 1 “Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional policy
information regarding TDRs.

BB&T’s performing TDRs, excluding government guaranteed
GNMA mortgage loans, totaled $982 million at December 31, 2015, a reduction of $68 million compared to the prior year. This decline
reflects lower performing TDR balances across most loan portfolios.

Payments and payoffs represent cash received from borrowers in connection
with scheduled principal payments, prepayments and payoffs of amounts outstanding. Transfers to nonperforming TDRs represent loans
that no longer meet the requirements necessary to reflect the loan in accruing status and as a result are subsequently classified
as a nonperforming TDR.

TDRs may be removed due to the passage of time if they: (1) did
not include a forgiveness of principal or interest, (2) have performed in accordance with the modified terms (generally a minimum
of six months), (3) were reported as a TDR over a year end reporting period, and (4) reflected an interest rate on the modified
loan that was no less than a market rate at the date of modification. These loans were previously considered TDRs as a result of
structural concessions such as extended interest-only terms or an amortization period that did not otherwise conform to normal
underwriting guidelines.

In addition, certain loans may be removed from classification as
a TDR as a result of a subsequent non-concessionary re-modification. Non-concessionary re-modifications represent TDRs that did
not contain concessionary terms at the date of a subsequent renewal/modification and there was a reasonable expectation that the
borrower would continue to comply with the terms of the loan subsequent to the date of the re-modification. A re-modification may
be considered for such a re-classification if the loan has not had a forgiveness of principal or interest and the modified terms
qualify as more than minor such that the re-modified loan is considered a new loan. Alternatively, such loans may be considered
for reclassification in years subsequent to the date of the re-modification based on the passage of time as described in the preceding
paragraph.

In connection with consumer loan TDRs, a NPL will be returned to
accruing status when current as to principal and interest and upon a sustained historical repayment performance (generally a minimum
of six months). The following table provides further details regarding the payment status of TDRs:

During the first quarter of 2014, $8.3 billion of loans were transferred from direct retail lending to residential mortgage. Charge-offs and recoveries have been reflected in these line items based upon the date the loans were transferred.

(2)

Includes charge-offs of $11 million related to performing TDR and NPL sales during 2014. Includes charge-offs of $87 million in residential mortgage loans during 2011 in connection with BB&T's NPL disposition strategy.

The ACL consists of the ALLL, which is presented separately on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the RUFC, which is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ACL totaled
$1.6 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $16 million compared to the prior year.


TableofContents

The ALLL amounted to 1.07% of loans and leases held for investment
at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.23% at December 31, 2014. This decline is primarily due to the acquisitions occurring during
2015, which provided $14.2 billion in loans and no related allowance as of the various acquisition dates. The ratio of the ALLL
to NPLs held for investment was 2.53x at December 31, 2015 compared to 2.39x at December 31, 2014.

Net charge-offs totaled $436 million for 2015, compared to $538
million in 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 0.35% for 2015, compared to 0.46% in 2014. Net
charge-offs declined in most loan portfolios, including decreases in the commercial and industrial and residential mortgage-nonguaranteed
portfolios of 50.6% and 50.7%, respectively. CRE – construction and development had net recoveries of $7 million for the
year.

Refer to Note 4 “Loans and ACL” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional disclosures.

The following table presents an estimated allocation of the ALLL
at the end of each of the last five years. This allocation of the ALLL is calculated on an approximate basis and is not necessarily
indicative of future losses or allocations. The entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category
of loans and leases. During 2013, the balance in the unallocated ALLL was incorporated into the loan portfolio segments.

FDIC Loss Share Receivable/Payable and Asset Acquired from
the FDIC

In connection with the Colonial acquisition, Branch Bank entered
into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that outline the terms and conditions under which the FDIC will reimburse Branch Bank
for a portion of the losses incurred on certain loans, OREO, investment securities and other assets. The following table presents
the carrying amount of assets by loss share agreement:

As of October 1, 2014, the loss sharing provisions of the commercial
loss sharing agreement expired; however, gains on the disposition of assets subject to this agreement will be shared with the FDIC
through September 30, 2017. Any gains realized after September 30, 2017 would not be shared with the FDIC. Assets subject to the
single family loss sharing agreement are indemnified through August 31, 2019.

The gain/loss sharing coverage related to the acquired AFS securities
is based on a contractually-specified value of the securities as of the date of the loss sharing agreement, adjusted to reflect
subsequent pay-downs, redemptions or maturities on the underlying securities. The contractually-specified value of these securities
totaled approximately $492 million at December 31, 2015. During the period of gain sharing (October 1, 2014 through September 30,
2017), any decline in the fair value of the acquired AFS securities down to the contractually-specified value would reduce BB&T’s
liability to the FDIC at the applicable loss sharing percentage. BB&T is not indemnified for declines in the fair value of
the acquired securities below the contractually-specified amount.

The terms of the loss sharing agreement with respect to certain
non-agency MBS provided that Branch Bank would be reimbursed by the FDIC for 95% of any and all losses incurred through the third
quarter of 2014. For other assets acquired from the FDIC, the FDIC reimbursement was as follows:

·

80% of net losses incurred up to $5 billion

·

95% of net losses in excess of $5 billion.

BB&T does not expect cumulative net losses to exceed $5 billion
on the respective assets acquired from FDIC. Gains and recoveries on assets acquired from FDIC, net of related expenses, will offset
losses or be paid to the FDIC at the applicable loss share percentage at the time of recovery.

Following the conclusion of the 10 year loss share period in 2019,
should actual aggregate losses, excluding securities, be less than an amount determined in accordance with these agreements, BB&T
will pay the FDIC a portion of the difference. As of December 31, 2015, BB&T projects that in 2019 Branch Bank would owe the
FDIC approximately $170 million under the aggregate loss calculation. As described below, this liability is expensed over time
and BB&T has recognized total expense of approximately $149 million through December 31, 2015.

The fair value of the net reimbursement the Company expected to
receive from the FDIC under these agreements was recorded as the FDIC loss share receivable at the date of acquisition. The fair
value of the FDIC loss share receivable/payable was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology.

Acquired loans were aggregated into separate pools based upon common
risk characteristics. Each pool is considered a unit of account and the cash flows expected to be collected, credit losses and
other relevant information are developed for each pool. A summary of the accounting treatment related to changes in credit losses
on each loan pool and the related FDIC loss share asset follows.

·

If the estimated credit loss on a loan pool is increased:

o

The reduction in the net present value of the loan pool is recognized immediately as provision expense and an increase to the
ALLL.

o

The FDIC loss share asset is increased by 80% of the adjustment to the ALLL through income, if applicable.


TableofContents

·

If the estimated credit loss on a loan pool is reduced:

o

If the loan pool has an allowance, the allowance is first reduced to $0 (and, if applicable, 80% of this reduction decreases
the FDIC loss share asset) through income.

o

If the loan pool does not have an allowance (or it is first reduced to $0 and there remains additional expected cash flows),
the excess of expected cash flows is recognized as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected life of the loan.

o

The decrease in expected reimbursement from the FDIC is recognized in income prospectively using a level yield methodology
over the remaining life of the loss share agreements.

o

The increase in the amount expected to be paid to the FDIC as a result of the aggregate loss calculation is recognized prospectively
in proportion to expected loan income over the remaining life of the loss share agreements.

The accounting treatment for securities acquired from the FDIC is
summarized below:

·

Prior to the recognition of OTTI on a security acquired from the FDIC:

o

The purchase discount established at acquisition is accreted into income over the expected life of the underlying securities
using a level yield methodology.

o

Changes to the expected life of the securities are recognized with a cumulative adjustment to the accretion recognized.

·

Subsequent to recognition of OTTI, which is determined using the same methodology that is applied to securities that were not
acquired from the FDIC, an increase in expected cash flows is recognized as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected life
of the security based on an evaluation of the nature of the increase.

·

The income statement effect of the above items is offset by the applicable loss share percentage in FDIC loss share income,
net, which cumulatively resulted in a liability of $265 million as of December 31, 2015. Subsequent to September 30, 2014, with
the expiration of commercial loss sharing, any OTTI will not be offset.

·

Securities acquired from the FDIC are classified as AFS and carried at fair market value. The changes in unrealized gains/losses
(down to the contractually specified amount) are offset by the applicable loss share percentage in AOCI, which resulted in a liability
of $271 million as of December 31, 2015.

·

BB&T would only owe these amounts to the FDIC if BB&T were to sell these securities prior to the end of the third quarter
of 2017. BB&T has no current intent to dispose of the securities.

The following table provides information related to the components
of the FDIC loss share receivable (payable):

The decrease in the carrying amount attributable to loans acquired
from the FDIC was due to the receipt of cash from the FDIC, negative accretion due to credit loss improvement and the offset to
the provision for loans acquired from the FDIC, which was a benefit for the current year. The change in the carrying amount attributable
to the aggregate loss calculation is primarily due to accretion of the expected payment. The fair values are based upon a discounted
cash flow methodology that is consistent with the acquisition date methodology. The fair value attributable to acquired loans and
the aggregate loss calculation changes over time due to the receipt of cash from the FDIC, updated credit loss assumptions and
the passage of time. The fair value attributable to securities acquired from the FDIC is based upon the timing and amount that
would be payable to the FDIC should they settle at the current fair value at the conclusion of the gain sharing period.

Funding Activities

Deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and investing
activities. Scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also
provide a stable source of funds. FHLB advances, other secured borrowings, Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed
funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. Funding activities
are monitored and governed through BB&T’s overall asset/liability management process, which is further discussed in the
“Market Risk Management” section in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” herein. The following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds.

Deposits

Deposits are attracted principally from clients within BB&T’s
branch network through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments to individuals and businesses, including noninterest-bearing
checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, CDs and IRAs. Deposit account
terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules.
Interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) the interest rates offered by competitors, (ii) the
anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated
future economic conditions and interest rates. Deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative
cost. Deposits are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship and provide opportunities to cross-sell other

Total deposits were $149.1 billion at December 31, 2015, an
increase of $20.1 billion compared to year-end 2014. This increase was driven by acquisition activity and organic growth. Noninterest-bearing
deposits totaled $45.7 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $6.9 billion from December 31, 2014. The majority of the increase
in noninterest-bearing deposits was due to business and personal deposits, which grew $4.1 billion (16.1%) and $2.7 billion (29.0%),
respectively.

Interest checking increased $5.1 billion and money market and savings
increased $9.9 billion during 2015, while time deposits and IRAs decreased $1.8 billion during 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, total deposits averaged
$138.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion compared to 2014. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.24% for 2015, compared
to 0.26% for 2014.

Average deposits for the fourth quarter were $148.5 billion, an
increase of $4.7 billion compared to the prior quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.7 billion, with approximately
$870 million of the increase due to acquisitions. Interest checking grew $1.6 billion (approximately $220 million excluding acquisitions)
and money market and savings grew $2.1 billion (approximately $535 million excluding acquisitions). Excluding acquisition activity,
time deposits declined approximately $650 million, or an annualized 18.5%.

The growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and lower-cost deposits
drove continued improvement in mix during the quarter. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 30.9% of total average deposits
for the fourth quarter, compared to 30.7% for the prior quarter and 30.0% a year ago.

Short-term Borrowings

BB&T also uses various types
of short-term borrowings to meet funding needs. While deposits remain the primary source for funding loan originations, management
uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other balance sheet management purposes. Short-term
borrowings were 1.6% of total funding on average in 2015 as compared to 1.8% in 2014. The types of short-term borrowings that have
been, or may be, used by the Company include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master notes,
commercial paper, short-term bank notes and short-term FHLB advances. Short-term borrowings at the end of 2015 were $3.6 billion,
a decrease of $124 million, or 3.3%, compared to year-end 2014. Average short-term borrowings totaled $3.2 billion during 2015
compared to $3.4 billion last year. The decrease in the average balance of short-term borrowings during 2015 primarily reflects
an increase in deposits as a funding source.

The following table summarizes certain information for the past
three years with respect to short-term borrowings:

Long-term Debt

Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory
capital. During 2015, long-term debt represented 11.8% of average total funding compared to 12.0% during 2014. At December 31,
2015, long-term debt totaled $23.8 billion, an increase of $457 million compared to year-end 2014. The increase in long-term debt
reflects the issuance of $1.0 billion of BB&T Corporation senior notes and $1.2 billion of Branch Bank subordinated notes,
as well as debt assumed through acquisitions, partially offset by the early extinguishment of $931 million of higher-cost FHLB
debt and other payments and maturities. The average cost of long-term debt was 2.13% in 2015, compared to 2.36% in 2014. See Note
9 “Long-Term Debt” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for further disclosure.


TableofContents

Exclusive of hedge basis adjustments, FHLB advances represented
24.0% of total outstanding long-term debt at December 31, 2015, compared to 28.5% at December 31, 2014. FHLB advances are
long-term funding sources that provide flexibility to structure the debt in a manner that aids in the management of interest rate
risk and liquidity.

Shareholders’ Equity

Shareholders’ equity totaled $27.3 billion at December 31,
2015, an increase of $3.0 billion, or 12.2%, from year-end 2014. Book value per common share at December 31, 2015 was $31.66,
compared to $30.09 at December 31, 2014.

Shareholders’ equity increased due to net income in excess
of dividends declared of $1.2 billion, as well as $2.2 billion of shares issued in connection with acquisitions. Additionally,
there were $88 million of issuances of shares and other transactions in connection with equity-based compensation plans, the 401(k)
plan and the dividend reinvestment plan.

These increases were partially offset by a $222 million reduction
to equity in connection with the AmRisc transaction. Additionally, the net loss in AOCI increased $277 million, primarily due to
a $186 million after-tax net decrease in the value of the AFS securities portfolio and a $97 million after-tax pension impact.

Tangible book value per common share at December 31, 2015 was
$19.82 compared to $19.86 at December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, measures of tangible capital were not required
by the regulators and, therefore, were considered non-GAAP measures. Refer to the section titled “Capital” herein for
a discussion of how BB&T calculates and uses these measures in the evaluation of the Company.

Risk Management

BB&T has a strong and consistent risk culture, based on established
risk values, which promotes predictable and consistent performance within an environment of open communication and effective challenge.
The strong culture influences all associates in the organization daily and helps them evaluate whether risks are acceptable or
unacceptable while making decisions that balance quality, profitability and growth appropriately. BB&T’s effective risk
management framework establishes an environment which enables it to achieve superior performance relative to peers, ensures that
BB&T is viewed among the safest of banks and assures the operational freedom to act on opportunities.

BB&T ensures that there is an appropriate return for the amount
of risk taken, and that the expected return is in line with its strategic objectives and business plan. Risk-taking activities
are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns while preserving asset value. BB&T
only undertakes risks that are understood and can be managed effectively. By managing risk well, BB&T ensures sufficient capital
is available to maintain and grow core business operations in a safe and sound manner.

Regardless of financial gain or loss to the Company, associates
are held accountable if they do not follow the established risk management policies and procedures. Compensation decisions take
into account an associate’s adherence to, and successful implementation of, BB&T’s risk values. The compensation
structure supports the Company’s core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking
behavior.

BB&T’s risk culture encourages transparency and open dialogue
between all levels in the performance of organizational functions, such as the development, marketing and implementation of a product
or service.

BB&T has established a risk management framework based on a
“three lines of defense” model:

·

First Line of Defense:

Risk management begins with the BUs, the point at which risk is originated and where risks must
be managed. Business unit managers in the first line identify, assess, control and report their group’s risk profile compared
to its approved risk limits.

·

Second Line of Defense:

The RMO provides independent oversight and guidance of risk-taking across the enterprise. The
RMO aggregates, integrates, and correlates risk information into a holistic picture of the corporation’s risk profile and
concentrations. The RMO establishes policies and limits and reports sources and amounts of risk to Executive Management and the
Board of Directors.

·

Third Line of Defense:

Audit Services (BB&T’s internal audit function) evaluates the design and effectiveness
of the risk management framework and its results. Results are reported to Executive Management and the Board of Directors according
to Audit Services Policy.

Chief Risk Officer

The CRO leads the RMO, which designs, organizes and manages BB&T’s
risk management framework. The RMO is responsible for ensuring effective risk management oversight, measurement, monitoring, reporting
and consistency. The CRO has direct access to the Board of Directors and Executive Management. The CRO is responsible for identifying
and communicating in a timely manner to the CEO and the Board of Directors meaningful risks and significant instances when the
RMO’s assessment of risk differs from that of a BU, significant instances when a BU is not adhering to the risk governance
framework, and BB&T’s risk profile in relation to its risk appetite on at least a quarterly basis. In the event that
the CRO and CEO’s assessment of risk were to differ or if the CEO were to not adhere to the risk management framework, the
CRO would have the responsibility to report such matters to the Board of Directors.

The Executive Management-led enterprise risk committees provide
oversight of the first and second lines of defense and communicate risk appetite and values to the RMO. The CRO and the enterprise
risk committees approve policies, set risk limits and tolerances and monitor results.

The RMC, CRMC, ORMC, CROC and the MRLCC are the enterprise risk
committees and provide oversight of the risks as described in the common risk language. Executive Management members participate
in all five committees.

The risk management framework is composed of specialized risk functions
focused on specific types of risk. The MRLCC, CRMC, CROC and ORMC provide oversight of market, liquidity, capital, credit, compliance,
and operational risk while RMC provides a fully integrated view of all material risks across the company. The RMC provides oversight
of all risks and its purpose is to review BB&T’s aggregate risk exposure, evaluate risk appetite, and evaluate risks
not reviewed by other risk committees.

The RMC is responsible for taking a broad view of risk, incorporating
information from all risk functions. This combination of broad and specific focus provides the most effective framework for the
management of risk. The RMC is chaired by the CRO and its membership includes all members of Executive Management, the General
Auditor (ex officio) and senior leaders from Financial Management, the RMO and other areas.

The principal types of inherent risk include compliance, credit,
liquidity, market, operational, reputation and strategic risks.

Compliance risk

Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or
capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies
and procedures or ethical standards. This risk exposes BB&T to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages and the voiding
of contracts. Compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities
and lessened expansion potential.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital
arising from the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial
obligation with BB&T or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance
of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. Credit risk arises when BB&T funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise
exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off balance sheet. Credit risk also occurs when the credit
quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates.


TableofContents

BB&T has established the following general practices to manage
credit risk:

·

limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;

·

establishing a process for credit approval accountability;

·

careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;

·

ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;

·

continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and

·

periodically reevaluating the bank’s strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions
change.

The following discussion presents the principal types of lending
conducted by BB&T and describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of BB&T’s lending function.

Underwriting Approach

The loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk,
therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to BB&T’s long-term financial success. BB&T’s underwriting
approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that ensure credit relationships conform
to BB&T’s risk philosophy. Provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate
new loans and loan renewals:

·

Cash flow and debt service coverage

—cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that
loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower’s cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources.

·

Secondary sources of repayment

—alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as
they are liquid, can be easily accessed and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.

·

Value of any underlying collateral

—loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. Because an analysis
of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify
loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower’s normal cash flows.

·

Overall creditworthiness of the customer, taking into account the customer’s relationships, both past and current,
with BB&T and other lenders

—BB&T’s success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships
with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.

·

Level of equity invested in the transaction

—in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion
of their own funds prior to any loan advances.

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio

The commercial loan and lease portfolio represents the largest category
of the Company’s total loan portfolio. BB&T’s commercial lending program is generally targeted to serve small-to-middle
market businesses with sales of $250 million or less. In addition, BB&T’s Corporate Banking Group provides lending solutions
to large corporate clients. Traditionally, lending to small and mid-sized businesses has been among BB&T’s strongest
market segments.

Commercial and small business loans are primarily originated through
BB&T’s Community Bank. In accordance with the Company’s lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting
process, which incorporates BB&T’s underwriting approach, procedures and evaluations described above. Commercial loans
are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate or LIBOR. Commercial loans are individually
monitored and reviewed for any possible deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. Approximately 87.7% of BB&T’s
commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories and other types of collateral.


TableofContents

Direct Retail Loan Portfolio

The direct retail loan portfolio primarily consists of a wide variety
of loan products offered through BB&T’s branch network. Various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to
qualifying existing clients and to other creditworthy candidates in BB&T’s market area. The vast majority of direct retail
loans are secured by first or second liens on residential real estate and include both closed-end home equity loans and revolving
home equity lines of credit. Direct retail loans are subject to the same rigorous lending policies and procedures as described
above for commercial loans and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that ensure consistency with the Company’s
risk philosophy.

Sales Finance Loan Portfolio

The sales finance category primarily includes secured indirect installment
loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. Such loans are originated through
approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the BB&T market area. These loans are relatively homogenous and no single
loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. Sales finance loans are subject to the same rigorous
lending policies and procedures as described above for commercial loans and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits
that ensure consistency with the Company’s risk philosophy. In addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, BB&T
uses application systems and “scoring systems” to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its sales finance portfolio.

Revolving Credit Loan Portfolio

The revolving credit portfolio consists of the outstanding balances
on credit cards and BB&T’s checking account overdraft protection product, Constant Credit. BB&T markets credit cards
to its existing banking client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing.
Such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed.

Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio

Branch Bank offers various types of fixed- and adjustable-rate loans
for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. BB&T primarily originates conforming mortgage
loans and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for owner-occupied properties. Conforming loans are loans that
are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by FNMA and FHLMC. They are generally collateralized by
one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, and are
made to borrowers in good credit standing.

Risks associated with the mortgage lending function include interest
rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage
market, and an effective MSR hedging process. Borrower risk is lessened through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance.
The right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. Management believes
that the retention of mortgage servicing is a relationship driver in retail banking and a part of management’s strategy to
establish profitable long-term customer relationships and offer high quality client service. BB&T also purchases residential
mortgage loans from correspondent originators. The loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to the same underwriting
and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.

Other Lending Subsidiaries Portfolio

BB&T’s other lending subsidiaries portfolio consists of
loans originated through BUs that provide specialty finance alternatives to consumers and businesses including: dealer-based financing
of equipment for small businesses and consumers, commercial equipment leasing and finance, insurance premium finance, indirect
nonprime automobile finance, and full-service commercial mortgage banking. BB&T offers these services to bank clients as well
as nonbank clients within and outside BB&T’s primary geographic market area.

BB&T’s other lending subsidiaries adhere to the same overall
underwriting approach as the commercial and consumer lending portfolio and also utilize automated credit scoring to assist with
underwriting credit risk. The majority of these loans are relatively homogenous and no single loan is individually significant
in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. The majority of the loans are secured by real estate, automobiles, equipment or
unearned insurance premiums. As of December 31, 2015, the other lending subsidiaries portfolio includes loans to nonprime borrowers
of approximately $3.2 billion.


TableofContents

PCI

The PCI balance includes $539 million of loans that are covered
by loss sharing agreements and $273 million of loans that were formerly covered by loss sharing agreements. Refer to Note 4 “Loans
and ACL” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” and to “Acquired from FDIC and FDIC Loss Share
Receivable/Payable”

section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” in this report for additional disclosures related to loans acquired from the FDIC.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or
capital that BB&T will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain
adequate funding (funding liquidity risk) or that it cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering
market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk).

Market risk

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital
arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes
in the level, volatility or correlations among financial market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates,
equity prices, commodity prices or other relevant rates or prices.

Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of
rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting
bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related
options embedded in bank products (options risk).

For additional information concerning BB&T’s management
of market risk, see the “Market Risk Management” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” herein.

Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings
or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. This definition includes
legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately
protect company-owned assets.

Cybersecurity

In recent years, cybersecurity has gained prominence within the
financial services industry due to increases in the quantity and sophistication of cyber attacks, which include significant distributed
denial-of-service attacks, malicious code and viruses and attempts to breach the security of systems, which, in certain instances,
have resulted in unauthorized access to customer account data.

BB&T has a number of complex information systems used for a
variety of functions by customers, employees and vendors. In addition, third parties with which BB&T does business or that
facilitate business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories and financial intermediaries) could
also be sources of cybersecurity risk to BB&T, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct
by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks which could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to BB&T.

As a FHC, BB&T must adhere to the security requirements and
expectations of the applicable regulatory agencies, which include requirements related to data privacy, systems availability and
business continuity planning, among others. The regulatory agencies have established guidelines for the responsibilities of the
board of directors and senior management, which include establishing policy, appointing and training personnel, implementing review
and testing functions and ensuring an appropriate frequency of updates.


TableofContents

The primary responsibility for cybersecurity at BB&T lies with
the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, which has delegated the day-to-day operations to management via the RMC, ORMC and
EITSC. The EITSC serves as the primary team responsible for monitoring and reporting on cybersecurity risks. The EITSC, which is
led by the Chief Information Officer, provides a bi-monthly report on cybersecurity to executive management and provides other
periodic cybersecurity reporting to the RMC and the ORMC. In addition, the Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security
Officer provide a quarterly Cyber Security Update to the Risk Committee or the full Board of Directors on a rotating basis. Annually,
the EITSC provides a formal IT risk assessment and Information Security reports to the Risk Committee.

As a complement to the overall cybersecurity infrastructure, BB&T
utilizes a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications
and other updates. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks
or other security risks. BB&T also uses third party services as part of its cybersecurity framework, and any such third parties
are required to comply with BB&T’s policies regarding information security and confidentiality. BB&T also uses third
party groups to assess and supplement the Company’s cybersecurity needs.

These cyber attacks have not, to date, resulted in any material
disruption to BB&T’s operations or harm to its customers and have not had a material adverse effect on BB&T’s
results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that a sophisticated cyber attack can be detected or thwarted.

Reputation risk

Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings,
capital, enterprise value, the BB&T brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether
real or perceived, regarding BB&T’s business practices, products, services, transactions, or other activities undertaken
by BB&T, its representatives, or its partners. A negative reputation may impair BB&T’s relationship with clients,
associates, communities or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly.

Strategic risk

Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital,
enterprise value and the achievement of BB&T’s vision, mission, purpose and business objectives consistent with its values
that arises from BB&T’s business strategy or potentially adverse business decisions, improper or ineffective implementation
of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Strategic risk is
a function of BB&T’s strategic goals, business strategies, resources and quality of implementation. The responsibility
for managing this risk rests with the Board of Directors, Executive Management and the Senior Leadership Team.

Market Risk Management

The effective management of market risk is essential to achieving
BB&T’s strategic financial objectives. As a financial institution, BB&T’s most significant market risk exposure
is interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also includes product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility
risk in BB&T’s LOBs. The primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize any adverse effect that changes
in market risk factors may have on net interest income, net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain
assets recorded at fair value. At BB&T, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function.

Interest Rate Market Risk (Other than Trading)

BB&T actively manages market risk associated with asset and
liability portfolios with a focus on the strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and management of appropriate maturity
mixes of assets and liabilities. The goal of these activities is the development of appropriate maturity and repricing opportunities
in BB&T’s portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce reasonably consistent net interest income during periods
of changing interest rates. These portfolios are analyzed for proper fixed-rate and variable-rate mixes under various interest
rate scenarios.


TableofContents

The asset/liability management process is designed to achieve relatively
stable NIM and assure liquidity by coordinating the volumes, maturities or repricing opportunities of earning assets, deposits
and borrowed funds. Among other things, this process gives consideration to prepayment trends related to securities, loans and
leases and certain deposits that have no stated maturity. Prepayment assumptions are developed using a combination of market data
and internal historical prepayment experience for residential mortgage-related loans and securities, and internal historical prepayment
experience for client deposits with no stated maturity and loans that are not residential mortgage related. These assumptions are
subject to monthly back-testing, and are adjusted as deemed necessary to reflect changes in interest rates relative to the reference
rate of the underlying assets or liabilities. On a monthly basis, BB&T evaluates the accuracy of its Simulation model, which
includes an evaluation of its prepayment assumptions, to ensure that all significant assumptions inherent in the model appropriately
reflect changes in the interest rate environment and related trends in prepayment activity. It is the responsibility of the MRLCC
to determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as to
ensure an adequate level of liquidity and capital, within the context of corporate performance goals. The MRLCC also sets policy
guidelines and establishes long-term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity. The MRLCC meets regularly
to review BB&T’s interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective market and business
conditions, and adopts funding and balance sheet management strategies that are intended to ensure that the potential impacts on
earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest rates are within acceptable tolerance guidelines.

BB&T uses derivatives primarily to manage economic risk related
to securities, commercial loans, MSRs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. BB&T also
uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients. As of December 31, 2015, BB&T had derivative financial
instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $67.5 billion, with a net fair value of a gain of $178 million. See Note
18 “Derivative Financial Instruments” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional
disclosures.

The majority of BB&T’s assets and liabilities are monetary
in nature and, therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed
assets or inventories. Fluctuations in interest rates and actions of the FRB to regulate the availability and cost of credit have
a greater effect on a financial institution’s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services. Through
its balance sheet management function, which is monitored by the MRLCC, management believes that BB&T is positioned to respond
to changing needs for liquidity, changes in interest rates and inflationary trends.

Management uses the Simulation to measure the sensitivity of projected
earnings to changes in interest rates. The Simulation projects net interest income and interest rate risk for a rolling two-year
period of time. The Simulation takes into account the current contractual agreements that BB&T has made with its customers
on deposits, borrowings, loans, investments and commitments to enter into those transactions. Furthermore, the Simulation considers
the impact of expected customer behavior. Management monitors BB&T’s interest sensitivity by means of a model that incorporates
the current volumes, average rates earned and paid, and scheduled maturities and payments of asset and liability portfolios, together
with multiple scenarios that include projected prepayments, repricing opportunities and anticipated volume growth. Using this information,
the model projects earnings based on projected portfolio balances under multiple interest rate scenarios. This level of detail
is needed to simulate the effect that changes in interest rates and portfolio balances may have on the earnings of BB&T. This
method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but management believes that it provides a better
illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses such as static or dynamic gap. In
addition to the Simulation, BB&T uses EVE analysis to focus on projected changes in capital given potential changes in interest
rates. This measure also allows BB&T to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the analysis window contained in the
Simulation. The EVE model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivative instruments. The difference
in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as the economic value of equity.

The asset/liability management process requires a number of key
assumptions. Management determines the most likely outlook for the economy and interest rates by analyzing external factors, including
published economic projections and data, the effects of likely monetary and fiscal policies, as well as any enacted or prospective
regulatory changes. BB&T’s current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth,
accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance are also considered. This data is combined with various interest
rate scenarios to provide management with the information necessary to analyze interest sensitivity and to aid in the development
of strategies to reach performance goals.


TableofContents

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes
in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next twelve months assuming a gradual change in interest
rates as described below. Key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mortgage-related and other
assets, cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing, deposit sensitivity, customer
preferences and capital plans. The resulting change in net interest income reflects the level of interest rate sensitivity that
income has in relation to the investment, loan and deposit portfolios.

The MRLCC has established parameters related to interest sensitivity
that prescribe a maximum negative impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In the event the results
of the Simulation model fall outside the established parameters, management will make recommendations to the MRLCC on the most
appropriate response given the current economic forecast. The following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered BB&T’s
primary measures of interest rate risk:

·

Maximum negative impact on net interest income of 2% for the next 12 months assuming a 25 basis
point change in interest rates each month for four months followed by a flat interest rate scenario for the remaining eight month
period.

·

Maximum negative impact on net interest income of 4% for the next 12 months assuming a 25 basis
point change in interest rates each month for eight months followed by a flat interest rate scenario for the remaining four month
period.

If a parallel rate change of 200 basis points cannot be modeled
due to a low level of rates, a proportional limit applies. Management currently only models a negative 25 basis point decline because
larger parallel declines would have resulted in a Federal funds rate of less than zero. In a situation such as this, the maximum
negative impact on net interest income is adjusted on a proportional basis. Regardless of the proportional limit, the negative
risk exposure limit will be the greater of the 1% or the proportional limit.

Management has also established a maximum negative impact on net
interest income of 4% for an immediate 100 basis points parallel change in rates and 8% for an immediate 200 basis points parallel
change in rates. As noted above, management currently only models a negative 25 basis point decline, and the maximum negative impact
on net interest income is adjusted on a proportional basis. Regardless of the proportional limit, the negative risk exposure limit
will be the greater of 2% or the proportional limit. These “interest rate shock” limits are designed to create an outer
band of acceptable risk based upon a significant and immediate change in rates.

Management also considers potential negative interest rate scenarios, which implies that a depositor would pay a premium for
a financial institution to hold funds on deposit. In such a scenario, some depositors may choose to withdraw their deposits
in lieu of paying an interest rate to BB&T to hold such deposits. As a result, management considers potential pricing
and structure changes, such as the movement to a primarily fee-based deposit system. Negative rates would also diminish the
spreads on loans and securities. As a result, management considers interest rate floors or rate index floors in loans to mitigate
this risk. BB&T purchases both fixed and variable rate securities. The fixed rate securities would be beneficial in a
negative interest rate environment.

Management must also consider how the balance sheet and interest
rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during
the current economic cycle. Much of this liquidity increase has been due to a significant increase in noninterest-bearing demand
deposits. Consistent with the industry, Branch Bank has seen a significant increase in this funding source. The behavior of these
deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of BB&T. A loss of these
deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of BB&T’s balance sheet as the Company increases interest-bearing
funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source.


TableofContents

Beta represents the correlation between overall market interest
rates and the rates paid by BB&T on interest-bearing deposits. BB&T applies an average beta of approximately 80% to its
managed rate deposits for determining its interest rate sensitivity. Managed rate deposits are high beta, premium money market
and interest checking accounts, which attract significant client funds when needed to support balance sheet growth. BB&T regularly
conducts sensitivity on other key variables to determine the impact they could have on the interest rate risk position. This allows
BB&T to evaluate the likely impact on its balance sheet management strategies due to a more extreme variation in a key assumption
than expected.

The following table shows the effect that the loss of demand deposits
and an associated increase in managed rate deposits would have on BB&T’s interest-rate sensitivity position. For purposes
of this analysis, BB&T modeled the incremental beta for the replacement of the lost demand deposits at 100%.

The base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at December 31, 2015 as presented in the preceding table.

If rates increased 200 basis points, BB&T could absorb the loss
of $10.1 billion, or 22.0%, of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and replace them with managed rate deposits with a beta of 100%
before becoming neutral to interest rate changes.

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes
in interest rates would have on EVE. Key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mortgage-related
and other assets, cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing and deposit sensitivity.

Market Risk from Trading Activities

BB&T also manages market risk from trading activities which
consists of acting as a financial intermediary to provide its customers access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities
markets. Trading market risk is managed through the use of statistical and non-statistical risk measures and limits. BB&T utilizes
a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading LOBs. This methodology uses two years of
historical data to estimate economic outcomes for a one-day time horizon at a 99% confidence level. The average 99% one-day VaR
and the maximum daily VaR for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were each less than $1 million. Market risk disclosures
under Basel II.5 are available in the Additional Disclosures section of the Investor Relations site on

www.bbt.com

.

Liquidity

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs,
including deposit withdrawals, timely repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition
to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and AFS securities, many other factors affect the ability to meet
liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity in national money markets, growing
core deposits, the repayment of loans and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale.


TableofContents

BB&T monitors the ability to meet customer demand for funds
under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates BB&T’s
funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and non-client rate-sensitive funding. In addition, management
also evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs
against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Branch Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position, management maintains a liquid
asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unpledged securities. BB&T follows regulation YY for purposes of determining
the liquid asset buffer. BB&T’s policy is to use the greater of 5% or a range of projected net cash outflows over a 30
day period. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, BB&T’s liquid asset buffer was 13.5% and 13.6%, respectively, of total
assets.

BB&T is considered to be a “modified LCR” holding company. BB&T would be subject to full LCR requirements
if its operations were to fall under the “internationally active” rules, which would generally be triggered if
BB&T’s assets were to increase above $250 billion. BB&T produces LCR calculations to effectively manage the
position of High-Quality Liquid Assets and the balance sheet deposit mix to optimize BB&T’s liquidity position.
BB&T’s LCR was approximately 130% at December 31, 2015, compared to the regulatory minimum for such entities of
90%, which puts BB&T in full compliance with the rule. The regulatory minimum will increase to 100% on January 1, 2017.
As noted above, BB&T is currently subject to the modified LCR requirement. BB&T routinely evaluates the impact
of becoming subject to the full LCR requirement. This includes an evaluation of the changes to the balance sheet and investment
strategy that would be necessary to comply with the requirement. Management does not currently expect the required changes
to have a material impact on BB&T’s financial condition or results of operations.

Parent Company

The purpose of the Parent Company is to serve as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries, with assets
primarily consisting of cash on deposit with Branch Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, accounts
receivable from subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous assets. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments
on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments
of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the
Parent Company are for investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders,
retirement of common stock and payments on long-term debt.

The primary source of funds used for Parent Company cash requirements
was dividends received from subsidiaries. See Note 16 “Parent Company Financial Statements” for additional information
regarding dividends from subsidiaries. In addition, the Parent Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes and repaid $934 million
of long-term debt. During periods that the Parent Company has funds raised through master note agreements with commercial clients,
these funds are placed in a note receivable at Branch Bank primarily for its use in meeting short-term funding needs and, to a
lesser extent, to support the short-term cash needs of the Parent Company. There were no master notes outstanding
as of December 31, 2015 or 2014.

Liquidity at the Parent Company is more susceptible to market disruptions.
BB&T prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected contractual cash outflows
which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities without the benefit
of any new cash infusions. Generally, BB&T maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of contractual cash
outflows. In determining the buffer, BB&T considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments
to affiliates, being a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions
that could limit access to the capital markets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Parent Company had 36 months and 31 months,
respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected contractual cash outflows as described above.

Branch Bank

BB&T carefully manages liquidity risk at Branch Bank. Branch
Bank’s primary source of funding is customer deposits. Continued access to customer deposits is highly dependent on the confidence
the public has in the stability of the bank and its ability to return funds to the client when requested. BB&T maintains a
strong focus on its reputation in the market to ensure continued access to client deposits. BB&T integrates its risk appetite
into its overall risk management framework to ensure the bank does not exceed its risk tolerance through its lending and other
risk taking functions and thus risk becoming undercapitalized. BB&T believes that sufficient capital is paramount to maintaining
the confidence of its depositors and other funds providers. BB&T has extensive capital management processes in place to ensure
it maintains sufficient capital to absorb losses and maintain a highly capitalized position that will instill confidence in the
bank and allow continued access to deposits and other funding sources. Branch Bank monitors many liquidity metrics at the bank
including funding concentrations, diversification, maturity distribution, contingent funding needs and ability to meet liquidity
requirements under times of stress.


TableofContents

Branch Bank has several major sources of funding to meet its liquidity
requirements, including access to capital markets through issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes and institutional CDs,
access to the FHLB system, dealer repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements with commercial clients, access to the overnight
and term Federal funds markets, use of a Cayman branch facility, access to retail brokered CDs and a borrower in custody program
with the FRB for the discount window. As of December 31, 2015, BB&T has approximately $70.6 billion of secured borrowing capacity,
which represents approximately 6.3 times the amount of one year wholesale funding maturities.

The ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by
the rating agencies’ views of the Parent Company’s and Branch Bank’s credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings.
Management meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to discuss current outlooks. The ratings for BB&T and Branch Bank
by the major rating agencies are detailed in the table below:

BB&T and Branch Bank have Contingency Funding Plans designed
to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet their ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of
a liquidity contraction. These plans are designed to examine and quantify the organization’s liquidity under various “stress”
scenarios. Additionally, the plans provide a framework for management and other critical personnel to follow in the event of a
liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The plans address authority for activation and decision making, liquidity
options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. The liquidity options available to
management could include seeking secured funding, asset sales, and under the most extreme scenarios, curtailing new loan originations.

Management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to
meet BB&T’s current requirements and plans for continued growth. See Note 5 “Premises and Equipment,” Note
9 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments
and obligations.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities,
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Related Party Transactions

The following table presents, as of December 31, 2015, BB&T’s
contractual obligations by payment date. The payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient. The table
excludes liabilities recorded where management cannot reasonably estimate the timing of any payments that may be required in connection
with these liabilities. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies”
in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”


TableofContents

The table above excludes the future cash payments associated with
the nonqualified pension plans. Refer to Note 13 “Benefit Plans” for information related to future payments under these
plans.

BB&T’s commitments include investments in affordable housing
and historic building rehabilitation projects throughout its market area and private equity funds. Refer to Note 1 “Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies” and to Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for further discussion of these commitments.

In addition, BB&T enters into derivative contracts to manage
various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference
to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market
interest rates as of the balance sheet date. Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts, which
only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and are not a measure of financial risk. Therefore, the
derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be
paid under these contracts. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” and Note 18 “Derivative Financial Instruments” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

In the ordinary course of business, BB&T indemnifies its officers
and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from litigation. BB&T also issues standard
representation and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities and
other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnifications provide similar indemnifications to BB&T. Although
these agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would
materially change the financial condition or results of operations of BB&T.

BB&T holds public funds in certain states that do not require
100% collateralization on public fund bank deposits. In these states, should the failure of another public fund depository institution
result in a loss for the public entity, the resulting shortfall would have to be absorbed on a pro-rata basis by the remaining
financial institutions holding public funds in that state.

As a member of the FHLB, BB&T is required to maintain a minimum
investment in capital stock. The board of directors of the FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in
the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because
the extent of any obligation to increase BB&T’s investment in the FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future
event, potential future payments to the FHLB are not determinable.


TableofContents

In the normal course of business, BB&T is also a party to financial
instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk. Such financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit and certain contractual agreements, including standby letters of credit and financial guarantee arrangements.
Further discussion of BB&T’s commitments is included in Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note
17 “Fair Value Disclosures” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Related Party Transactions

The Company may transact with its officers, directors and other
related parties in the ordinary course of business. These transactions include substantially the same terms as comparable third-party
arrangements and are in compliance with applicable banking regulations.

Capital

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management
priority and is monitored on a regular basis. BB&T’s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide
adequate capital to support BB&T’s risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility
to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit
ratings for BB&T and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders.

Management regularly monitors the capital position of BB&T on
both a consolidated and bank level basis. In this regard, management’s overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels
that are in excess of the operating capital guidelines, which are above the regulatory “well capitalized” levels. Management
has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum guidelines to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated with planned capital actions
are likely to remain above minimums specified by the FRB for the annual CCAR. Breaches of stressed minimum guidelines prompt a
review of the planned capital actions included in BB&T’s capital plan.

Payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are
the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. In addition, management closely monitors the Parent Company’s double
leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders’ equity). The active management of the subsidiaries’
equity capital, as described above, is the process used to manage this important driver of Parent Company liquidity and is a key
element in the management of BB&T’s capital position.


TableofContents

Management intends to maintain capital at Branch Bank at levels
that will result in classification as “well-capitalized” for regulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is management’s
intent to maintain Branch Bank’s capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally
comparable with peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile. If the capital levels of Branch Bank increase above these guidelines,
excess capital may be transferred to the Parent Company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other
operating considerations.

While nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in
the Company temporarily falling below its operating minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios, it is management’s
intent through capital planning to return to these targeted operating minimums within a reasonable period of time. Such temporary
decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of BB&T’s overall capital policy,
provided a return above the minimums is forecast to occur within a reasonable time period.

BB&T regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels
and is required to periodically submit the company’s capital plans to the banking regulators. The FRB did not object to the
Company’s 2015 capital plan, and the 2016 capital plan is expected to be submitted during April 2016. Management’s
capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on organic growth, dividends, strategic opportunities and share repurchases.

Risk-based capital ratios, which include Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital
and Tier 1 Common Equity, are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.
The decrease in regulatory capital was primarily due to current year acquisition activity, partially offset by earnings in excess
of dividends.

Fourth Quarter Results

Consolidated net income available to common shareholders for the
fourth quarter of 2015 totaling $502 million was down 8.9% compared to $551 million earned during the same period in 2014. On a
diluted per common share basis, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.64, down 14.7% compared to $0.75 for the same period
in 2014. BB&T’s results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 produced an annualized return on average assets
of 1.03% and an annualized return on average common shareholders’ equity of 8.06%, compared to prior year ratios of 1.28%
and 9.99%, respectively. These results include merger-related and restructuring charges of $50 million and $18 million, respectively.

Total revenues on a FTE basis were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter
of 2015, up $164 million compared to the earlier quarter. This increase was driven by a $171 million increase in taxable-equivalent
net interest income, largely the result of the Susquehanna and The Bank of Kentucky acquisitions

Net interest margin was 3.35%, compared to 3.36% for the earlier
quarter. Average earning assets increased $20.6 billion, or 12.7%, while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $13.3 billion,
or 11.4%, both of which were primarily driven by the Susquehanna and The Bank of Kentucky acquisitions. The annualized yield on
the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter was 4.31%, an increase of two basis points compared to the earlier quarter, which
primarily reflects the impact of the current year acquisitions, partially offset by runoff of loans acquired from the FDIC. The
annualized fully taxable-equivalent yield on the average securities portfolio for the fourth quarter was 2.30%, compared to 2.45%
for the earlier period. This decline reflects lower rates on mortgage-backed securities, runoff of securities acquired from the
FDIC and larger holdings in U.S. Treasuries.


TableofContents

The average annualized cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.24%,
a decline of one basis point compared to the earlier quarter. The average annualized rate paid on long-term debt was 2.11%, compared
to 2.22% for the earlier quarter. This decrease was primarily due to early extinguishments of higher cost FHLB advances.

Excluding acquired from FDIC and PCI loans, the provision for credit
losses was $128 million, compared to $84 million in the earlier quarter. The earlier quarter included a $24 million allowance release
related to the sale of nonperforming mortgage loans, which also resulted in $4 million of net recoveries. Net charge-offs for the
fourth quarter of 2015, excluding loans acquired from the FDIC and PCI, totaled $130 million, compared to $102 million for the
earlier quarter.

The $7 million decrease in noninterest income was driven by lower
insurance income, mortgage banking income and investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, partially offset by improved
FDIC loss share income and higher other income.

Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015,
an increase of $203 million compared to the earlier quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the Susquehanna and The Bank
of Kentucky acquisitions, which resulted in higher personnel expense, occupancy and equipment expense, merger-related and restructuring
charges and other expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in loan-related expense.

The provision for income taxes was $251 million for the fourth quarter
of 2015, compared to $277 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 of
31.7%, compared to 31.5% for the earlier quarter.

Reclassifications

In certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior
period information to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders’
equity or net income.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of BB&T are in accordance
with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The financial position
and results of operations are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions
and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different
assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or
consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding BB&T’s accounting policies is fundamental to
understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, BB&T’s significant
accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in
Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

The following is a summary of BB&T’s critical accounting
policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments. These critical accounting policies are reviewed with
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a periodic basis.

ACL

BB&T’s policy is to maintain an ALLL and a RUFC that represent
management’s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending
commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical loan and lease
losses, historical loan and lease migration to charge-off experience, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, expected
cash flows on purchased loans, current assessment of problem loans and leases, the results of regulatory examinations and changes
in the size, composition and risk assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. As part of this process, BB&T develops a series
of loss estimate factors, which are modeled projections of the frequency, timing and severity of losses. These loss estimate factors
are based on historical loss experience, economic and political environmental considerations and any other data that management
believes will provide evidence about the expected collectability of outstanding loan and lease amounts. The following table summarizes
the loss estimate factors used to determine the ALLL:

Loss Estimate Factor

Description

Loss Frequency

Indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan

Loss Severity

Indicates the amount of estimated loss at the time of default


TableofContents

For collectively evaluated loans, the ALLL is determined by multiplying
the loan exposure by the loss frequency and loss severity factors. For individually evaluated loans, the ALLL is determined through
review of data specific to the borrower. For TDRs, default expectations and estimated slower prepayment speeds that are specific
to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the ALLL. Also included in management’s
estimates for loan and lease losses are considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which
are uncertain. These events may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in overall interest rates, political conditions,
legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical
areas and industries in which BB&T conducts business.

The methodology used to determine an estimate for the RUFC is inherently
similar to the methodology used in calculating the ALLL adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability
of funding and exposure at the time of funding. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ALLL and the RUFC
is included in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The vast majority of assets and liabilities carried at fair value
are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. See Note 17 “Fair Value Disclosures”
in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial
instruments.

Securities

BB&T generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining
the fair value of its AFS and trading securities. Fair value measurements are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were
developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads
and broker quotes. Management performs various procedures to evaluate the accuracy of the fair values provided by the third-party
service provider. These procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible LOB, include comparison of pricing information
received from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by
the third party pricing service and other third party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized
on any security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third party pricing service. The IPV committee, which
provides oversight to BB&T’s enterprise-wide IPV function, is responsible for oversight of the comparison of pricing
information received from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined
by IPV for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving
the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. When market observable data is not available, which generally
occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial
judgment by management.

BB&T periodically reviews AFS securities with an unrealized
loss. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. The
purpose of the review is to consider the length of time and the extent to which the market value of a security has been below its
amortized cost. The primary factors BB&T considers in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary are long-term
expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments and BB&T’s intent to sell and whether it
is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized
cost basis.

MSRs

BB&T has a significant mortgage loan servicing portfolio with
two classes of MSRs for which it separately manages the economic risk: residential and commercial. Residential MSRs are primarily
carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income. BB&T uses various derivative
instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions
of its residential MSRs. MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur,
the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, BB&T estimates the fair value of residential
MSRs using an OAS valuation model to project MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at
risk-adjusted rates. The OAS model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions,
delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. BB&T reassesses and
periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the OAS model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a
market participant would consider in valuing the MSR asset.


TableofContents

Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys,
recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. Due to the nature of the valuation
inputs, MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The value of MSRs is significantly affected by mortgage
interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of declining
interest rates, the value of MSRs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity.
Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of MSRs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. Refer
to Note 7 “Loan Servicing” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for quantitative disclosures
reflecting the effect that changes in management’s assumptions would have on the fair value of MSRs.

During 2015 and prior years, commercial MSRs were carried at the
lower of cost or market and amortized over the estimated period that servicing income was expected to be received based on projections
of the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. The amount and timing of servicing asset amortization was based on actual
results and updated projections. Effective January 1, 2016, BB&T adopted the fair value method for commercial MSRs. The impact
of this adoption was not material.

LHFS

BB&T originates certain mortgage loans for sale to investors
that are carried at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types
of loans. Changes in the fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income, while the related origination costs
are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. The changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates
subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the LHFS. BB&T uses various derivative
instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans.

Derivative Assets and Liabilities

BB&T uses derivatives to manage various financial risks. BB&T
mitigates the credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and
other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to BB&T when their unsecured
loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted
market prices and internal pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. The fair value of interest rate
lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that
BB&T does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee.

Private Equity and Similar Investments

BB&T has private equity and similar investments that are carried
at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded in other noninterest income each period. In many cases
there are no observable market values for these investments and management must estimate the fair value based on a comparison of
the operating performance of the company to multiples in the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires significant
judgment, and actual values in a sale could differ materially from those estimated. As of December 31, 2015, BB&T had $289
million of these investments, which represented less than 1% of total assets.

Intangible Assets

The acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets
and liabilities are recorded at their fair values. This often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations
based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. The amortization
of identified intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. Acquisitions
typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units
to which the acquired goodwill relates. Refer to Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a description of the impairment testing process. Management considers the sensitivity
of the significant assumptions in its impairment analysis including consideration of a 10% change in estimated future cash flows
or the discount rate for each reporting unit.


TableofContents

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

BB&T offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit
plans to employees. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation
methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used.
The discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to a high-quality (AA-rated
or higher) corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and
payment durations. Management evaluated the sensitivity changes that the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would
have on pension expense for 2015. A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense
of approximately $24 million for 2016, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result
in an increase of approximately $46 million in pension expense for 2016. Refer to Note 13 “Benefit Plans” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” for disclosures related to BB&T’s benefit plans.

Income Taxes

The calculation of BB&T’s income
tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. As part of the Company’s analysis and implementation
of business strategies, consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances
for any tax position under evaluation. For tax positions that are uncertain in nature, management determines whether the tax position
is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For tax positions that meet this threshold, management then estimates
the amount of the tax benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Management closely monitors tax developments in order to
evaluate the effect they may have on the Company’s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining
the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting and Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management of BB&T is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. BB&T’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of BB&T’s management
and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material impact on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
and procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)”
promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the “COSO”
criteria. Based on this evaluation under the COSO criteria, management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2015.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the management
of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, carried out an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

There was no change in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 that has materially affected, or is likely to materially affect,
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their accompanying report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BB&T Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and
2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this Report
for terms used throughout the consolidated financial statements and related notes of this Form 10-K.

The accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP.
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities.
The following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies.

Nature of Operations

BB&T is a FHC organized under the laws of North Carolina. BB&T
conducts operations through a bank subsidiary, Branch Bank, and nonbank subsidiaries. Branch Bank’s offices are concentrated
primarily in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic United States. BB&T provides a wide range of banking services to individuals,
businesses and municipalities. BB&T offers a variety of loans and lease financing to individuals and entities primarily within
BB&T’s geographic footprint, including insurance premium financing; permanent CRE financing arrangements; loan servicing
for third-party investors; direct consumer finance loans to individuals; credit card lending; automobile financing; factoring and
equipment financing. BB&T also markets a wide range of other services, including deposits; discount and full service brokerage,
annuities and mutual funds; life insurance, property and casualty insurance, health insurance and commercial general liability
insurance on an agency basis and through a wholesale insurance brokerage operation; trust and retirement services; comprehensive
wealth advisory services; asset management and capital markets services.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BB&T
Corporation and those subsidiaries that are majority owned by BB&T or over which BB&T exercises control. Intercompany accounts
and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of companies or assets acquired are included from the
dates of acquisition. All material wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated unless GAAP requires otherwise.

BB&T holds investments in certain legal entities that are considered
VIEs. VIEs are legal entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to independently finance
its activities, or as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the power through voting or similar rights to
direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, or do not have the obligation to absorb
the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity. Consolidation of a VIE is required
if a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

Investments in VIEs are evaluated to determine if BB&T is the
primary beneficiary. This evaluation gives appropriate consideration to the design of the entity and the variability that the entity
was designed to pass along, the relative power of each party, and to BB&T’s relative obligation to absorb losses or receive
residual returns of the entity, in relation to such obligations and rights held by each party. During 2015, BB&T disposed of
its variable interests in its Tender Option Bond program trusts, which allowed for tax-advantaged financing of certain debt instruments
issued by tax-exempt entities. BB&T was considered the primary beneficiary of the Tender Option Bond program trusts, resulting
in the consolidation of their assets and liabilities in prior years. BB&T also has variable interests in certain entities that
were not required to be consolidated, including affordable housing partnership interests, historic tax credit partnerships and
other partnership interests. Refer to Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional disclosures regarding
BB&T’s significant VIEs.

BB&T accounts for unconsolidated partnerships and similar investments
using the equity method of accounting. BB&T records its portion of income or loss in other noninterest income in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. These investments are periodically evaluated for impairment. BB&T also has investments in, and future
funding commitments to, private equity investments, which are accounted for based on BB&T’s ownership and control rights
specific to each investment.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts reported in prior periods’ consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported
cash flows, shareholders’ equity or net income.


TableofContents

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible
to significant change include the determination of the ACL, determination of fair value for financial instruments, valuation of
goodwill, intangible assets and other purchase accounting related adjustments, benefit plan obligations and expenses, and tax assets,
liabilities and expense.

Business Combinations

BB&T accounts for business combinations using the acquisition
method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase
price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill.

BB&T typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition,
depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of common shares issued is determined based on the market price
of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits with banks and Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements. Cash and cash
equivalents have maturities of three months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such instruments is considered a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash represents amounts posted as collateral for derivatives
in a loss position.

Securities

BB&T classifies marketable investment securities as HTM, AFS
or trading. Interest income and dividends on securities are recognized in income on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on
debt securities are amortized as an adjustment to interest income using the interest method.

Debt securities are classified as HTM where BB&T has both the
intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These securities are reported at amortized cost.

Debt securities, which may be sold to meet liquidity needs arising
from unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, changes in regulatory capital requirements, or unforeseen changes in market conditions,
are classified as AFS. AFS securities are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI,
net of deferred income taxes, in the shareholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses realized
from the sale of AFS securities are determined by specific identification and are included in noninterest income.

Each HTM and AFS security in a loss position is evaluated for OTTI.
BB&T considers such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below amortized cost, long
term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments, BB&T’s intent to sell and whether
it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized
cost basis. The credit component of an OTTI loss is recognized in earnings and the non-credit component is recognized in AOCI in
situations where BB&T does not intend to sell the security and it is more-likely-than-not that BB&T will not be required
to sell the security prior to recovery. Subsequent to recognition of OTTI, an increase in expected cash flows is recognized as
a yield adjustment over the remaining expected life of the security based on an evaluation of the nature of the increase.

Trading account securities, which include both debt and equity securities,
are reported at fair value and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized fair value adjustments,
fees, and realized gains or losses from trading account activities (determined by specific identification) are included in noninterest
income. Interest income on trading account securities is included in interest on other earning assets.


TableofContents

LHFS

BB&T accounts for new originations of prime residential and
commercial mortgage LHFS at fair value. BB&T accounts for the derivatives used to economically hedge the LHFS at fair value.
The fair value of LHFS is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities collateralized by similar types of loans. Direct
loan origination fees and costs related to LHFS are not capitalized and are recorded as mortgage banking income in the case of
the direct loan origination fees and primarily personnel expense in the case of the direct loan origination costs. Gains and losses
on sales of mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking income. Gains and losses on sales of commercial LHFS are included in
other noninterest income.

BB&T sells a significant portion of its fixed-rate commercial
and conforming residential mortgage loan originations, which are typically converted into MBS by FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA and subsequently
sold to other third party investors. BB&T records these transactions as a sale when the transferred loans are legally isolated
from BB&T’s creditors and the other accounting criteria for a sale are met. Gains or losses recorded on these transactions
are based in part on the net carrying amount of the loans sold, which is allocated between the loans sold and retained interests
based on their relative fair values at the date of sale. BB&T generally retains the mortgage servicing on loans sold. Since
quoted market prices are not typically available, BB&T estimates the fair value of these retained interests using modeling
techniques to determine the net present value of expected future cash flows. Such models incorporate management’s best estimates
of key variables, such as prepayment speeds, servicing costs and discount rates, that would be used by market participants based
on the risks involved.

Gains on residential mortgage loan sales, including marking LHFS
to fair value and the impact of interest rate lock commitments, are recorded in noninterest income as a component of mortgage banking
income. For certain of these transactions, the loan servicing rights were retained, including the related MSRs and on-going servicing
fees.

BB&T also issues standard representations and warranties related
to mortgage loan sales to GSEs. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, management does not believe that any
payments related to these warranties would materially change the financial condition or results of operations of BB&T.

Loans and Leases

The Company’s accounting methods for loans differ depending
on whether the loans are originated or purchased, and if purchased, whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration since
the date of origination such that it is probable at the date of acquisition that BB&T will be unable to collect all contractually
required payments.

Originated Loans and Leases

Loans and leases that management has the intent and ability to hold
for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, and unamortized
fees and costs. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the lending process
are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using methods that approximate the interest
method.

BB&T classifies loans and leases as past due when the payment
of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent or if one payment is past due. When commercial
loans are placed on nonaccrual status as described below, a charge-off is recorded, as applicable, to decrease the carrying value
of such loans to the estimated recoverable amount. Retail loans are subject to mandatory charge-off at a specified delinquency
date consistent with regulatory guidelines. As such, retail loans are subject to collateral valuation and charge-off, as applicable,
when they are moved to nonaccrual status as described below.

Purchased Loans

Purchased loans are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition
date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an ALLL is not recorded at the acquisition date.


TableofContents

Purchased loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified as
either purchased impaired or purchased non-impaired. Purchased impaired loans reflect credit deterioration since origination such
that it is probable at acquisition that BB&T will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. For purchased impaired
loans, expected cash flows at the acquisition date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the
life of the loans using a level yield method if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Subsequent
to the acquisition date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest
income. Decreases in expected cash flows due to credit deterioration are recognized by recording an ALLL. For purchased non-impaired
loans, the difference between the fair value and UPB of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income
over the estimated life of the loans using the effective interest method.

TDRs

Modifications to a borrower’s debt agreement are considered
TDRs if a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties that otherwise
would not be considered. TDRs are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan and may take the form of
modifications made with the stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, other modifications
to the structure of the loan that fall outside of normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in certain limited circumstances
forgiveness of principal or interest. Modifications of loans acquired from the FDIC that are part of a pool accounted for as a
single asset are not considered TDRs. TDRs can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accruing
status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. In circumstances where the TDR involves charging off
a portion of the loan balance, BB&T typically classifies these TDRs as nonaccrual.

In connection with commercial TDRs, the decision to maintain a loan
that has been restructured on accrual status is based on a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial
condition and prospects for repayment under the modified terms. This evaluation includes consideration of the borrower’s
current capacity to pay, which among other things may include a review of the borrower’s current financial statements, an
analysis of cash flow available to pay debt obligations, and an evaluation of secondary sources of payment from the client and
any guarantors. This evaluation also includes an evaluation of the borrower’s current willingness to pay, which may include
a review of past payment history, an evaluation of the borrower’s willingness to provide information on a timely basis, and
consideration of offers from the borrower to provide additional collateral or guarantor support. The credit evaluation may also
include review of cash flow projections, consideration of the adequacy of collateral to cover all principal and interest and trends
indicating improving profitability and collectability of receivables.

The evaluation of mortgage and retail loans includes an evaluation
of the client’s debt to income ratio, credit report, property value, loan vintage, and certain other client-specific factors
that impact their ability to make timely principal and interest payments on the loan.

Nonaccrual commercial TDRs may be returned to accrual status based
on a current, well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects for repayment under the
modified terms. This evaluation must include consideration of the borrower’s sustained historical repayment performance for
a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) prior to the date on which the loan is returned to accrual status. Sustained
historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the TDR may be taken into account. In connection with retail TDRs,
a NPL will be returned to accruing status when current as to principal and interest and upon a sustained historical repayment performance
(generally a minimum of six months).

TDR classification may be removed for a loan upon the occurrence
of a non-concessionary subsequent modification that is at market terms and within current underwriting guidelines.

NPAs

NPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property consists
of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of customers’ loan defaults. BB&T’s policies for placing loans
on nonaccrual status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The majority of commercial loans and leases
are placed on nonaccrual status when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible, or generally when principal
or interest becomes 90 days past due, whichever occurs first. Other lending subsidiaries’ loans, which includes both retail
and commercial loans, are placed on nonaccrual status generally when principal and interest becomes 90 days past due. Direct retail,
mortgage and sales finance loans are placed on nonaccrual status at varying intervals, based on the type of product, generally
when principal and interest becomes between 90 days and 120 days past due. PCI loans are considered to be performing due to the
application of the expected cash flows method.


TableofContents

Residential mortgage NPLs secured by 1-4 family properties are generally
charged down to the fair value of the collateral securing the loan less costs to sell upon becoming 120 days past due, unless the
shortfall is covered by private mortgage insurance. Nonperforming residential mortgage TDRs generally incur charge-offs at 120
days. If a known loss is identified prior to these time periods, the applicable charge-off occurs immediately. BB&T recognizes
charge-offs on government guaranteed NPLs to the extent that the carrying value of the NPL exceeds the guaranteed amount.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, BB&T implemented a residential
mortgage and direct retail lending policy change to move loans to nonaccrual status at 120 days past due instead of 180 days.

Charge-offs are recorded on revolving credit loans after they become
180 days past due and commercial bank card balances after they become 90 days past due. Unpaid fees and finance charges are reversed
against interest income in the period in which the charge-off occurs. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4 family properties are
charged down to the fair value of the collateral securing the loan less costs to sell upon becoming between 90 and 120 days past
due, depending on the type of loan.

Secured retail loans discharged through bankruptcy are charged down
to the fair value of the related collateral, and the remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual status.

Certain past due loans may remain on accrual status if management
determines that it does not have concern over the collectability of principal and interest. Generally, when loans are placed on
nonaccrual status, accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest payments received
thereafter are applied as a reduction to the remaining principal balance as long as concern exists as to the ultimate collection
of the principal. Nonaccrual mortgage loans are accounted for using the cash basis. Loans and leases are generally removed from
nonaccrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and concern no longer exists as to the collectability
of principal and interest.

Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are subsequently carried
at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value equals fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of
cost over net realizable value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic revaluations of
the collateral underlying impaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The periodic revaluations are generally based on the appraised
value of the property and may include additional liquidity adjustments based upon the expected retention period. BB&T’s
policies require that valuations be updated at least annually and that upon foreclosure, the valuation must not be more than six
months old, otherwise an updated appraisal is required. Routine maintenance costs, other costs of ownership, subsequent declines
in fair value and net losses on disposal are included in foreclosed property expense.

ACL

The ACL includes the ALLL and the RUFC. The ACL represents management’s
best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at
the balance sheet date. Estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical loan and lease losses, historical
loan and lease migration to charge-off experience, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, expected cash flows on purchased
loans, current assessment of problem loans and leases, the results of regulatory examinations and changes in the size, composition
and risk assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. As part of this process, BB&T develops a series of loss estimate factors,
which are modeled projections of the frequency, timing and severity of losses. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to the provision
for credit losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loan or lease balances deemed to be uncollectible
are charged off against the ALLL. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL. The methodology used to
determine the RUFC is inherently similar to that used to determine the collectively evaluated component of the ALLL, adjusted for
factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. While management uses the
best information available to establish the ACL, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially
from the assumptions used in computing the ACL or, if required by regulators based upon information available to them at the time
of their examinations.

Accounting standards require the presentation of certain disclosure
information at the portfolio segment level, which represents the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology
to determine its ACL. BB&T concluded that its loan and lease portfolio consists of three portfolio segments; commercial, retail
and PCI. The commercial portfolio segment includes CRE, commercial and industrial and other loans originated by certain other lending
subsidiaries, and was identified based on the risk-based approach used to estimate the ALLL for the vast majority of these loans.
The retail portfolio segment includes direct retail lending, revolving credit, residential mortgage, sales finance and other loans
originated by certain retail-oriented subsidiaries, and was identified based on the delinquency-based approach used to estimate
the ALLL. The PCI portfolio segment was identified based on the expected cash flows approach used to estimate the ALLL.


TableofContents

The entire amount of the ACL is available to absorb losses on any
loan category or lending-related commitment.

The following provides a description of accounting policies and
methodologies related to each of the portfolio segments:

Commercial

The vast majority of loans in the commercial lending portfolio are
assigned risk ratings based on an assessment of conditions that affect the borrower’s ability to meet contractual obligations
under the loan agreement. This process includes reviewing borrowers’ financial information, historical payment experience,
credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each borrower. Risk ratings are reviewed on an annual
basis for all credit relationships with total credit exposure of $1 million or more, or at any point management becomes aware of
information affecting the borrowers’ ability to fulfill their obligations.

Risk Rating

Description

Pass

Loans not considered to be problem credits

Special Mention

Loans that
have a potential weakness deserving management’s close attention

Substandard

Loans for which a well-defined weakness has been identified that may put full collection of contractual
cash flows at risk

For commercial clients with total credit exposure less than $1 million,
BB&T has developed an automated loan review system to identify and proactively manage accounts with a higher risk of loss.
The “score” produced by this automated system is updated monthly.

During 2013, to establish a reserve, BB&T’s policy was
to review all commercial lending relationships with outstanding debt of $5 million or more that were classified as substandard.
During the first quarter of 2014, this process was revised such that any obligor with an outstanding nonaccrual balance of $3 million
or more is reviewed. While this review is largely focused on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, BB&T also considers
the capacity and willingness of a loan’s guarantors to support the debt service on the loan as a secondary source of repayment.
When a guarantor exhibits the documented capacity and willingness to support the loan, BB&T may consider extending the loan
maturity and/or temporarily deferring principal payments if the ultimate collection of both principal and interest is not in question.
In these cases, BB&T may deem the loan to not be impaired due to the documented capacity and willingness of the guarantor to
repay the loan. Loans are considered impaired when the borrower (or guarantor in certain circumstances) does not have the cash
flow capacity or willingness to service the debt according to contractual terms, or it does not appear reasonable to assume that
the borrower will continue to pay according to the contractual agreement. BB&T establishes a specific reserve for each loan
that has been deemed impaired based on the criteria outlined above. The amount of the reserve is based on the present value of
expected cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate and/or the value of collateral, net of costs to sell.
In addition, beginning with the first quarter of 2014, BB&T reviews any collateral-dependent commercial loan balances between
$1 million and $3 million to establish a specific reserve based on the underlying collateral value, net of costs to sell.

BB&T also has a review process related to TDRs and other commercial
impaired loans. In connection with this process, BB&T establishes reserves related to these loans that are calculated using
an expected cash flow approach. These discounted cash flow analyses incorporate adjustments to future cash flows that reflect management’s
best estimate of the default risk related to TDRs based on a combination of historical experience and management judgment.

BB&T also maintains reserves for collective impairment that
reflect an estimate of losses related to non-impaired commercial loans as of the balance sheet date. Embedded loss estimates for
BB&T’s commercial loan portfolio are based on estimated migration rates, which are based on historical experience, and
current risk mix as indicated by the risk grading process described above. Embedded loss estimates may be adjusted to reflect current
economic conditions and current portfolio trends including credit quality, concentrations, aging of the portfolio, and significant
policy and underwriting changes.


TableofContents

Retail

The majority of the ALLL related to the retail lending portfolio
is calculated on a collective basis using delinquency status, which is the primary factor considered in determining whether a retail
loan should be classified as nonaccrual. Embedded loss estimates for BB&T’s retail lending portfolio are based on estimated
migration rates that are developed based on historical experience, and current risk mix as indicated by prevailing delinquency
rates. These estimates may be adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and current portfolio trends. The remaining portion
of the ALLL related to the retail lending portfolio relates to loans that have been deemed impaired based on their classification
as a TDR at the balance sheet date. BB&T establishes specific reserves related to these TDRs using an expected cash flow approach.
The ALLL for retail TDRs is based on discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate adjustments to future cash flows that reflect
management’s best estimate of the default risk related to TDRs based on a combination of historical experience and management
judgment.

PCI

PCI loans (including all loans acquired in an FDIC-assisted transaction)
are aggregated into loan pools based upon common risk characteristics. The ALLL for each loan pool is based on an analysis that
is performed each period to estimate the expected cash flows. To the extent that the expected cash flows of a loan pool have decreased
due to credit deterioration, BB&T establishes an ALLL.

Assets Acquired from the FDIC and Related FDIC Loss Share
Receivable/Payable

Certain loans, securities and other assets were acquired from the
FDIC in connection with the Colonial transaction and are divided between two loss sharing agreements, the single family loss share
agreement and the commercial loss share agreement. The single family loss share agreement expires in 2019. Assets subject to the
single family loss share agreement have loss and recovery sharing with the FDIC and are referred to as “covered” assets.

Effective October 1, 2014, the loss sharing provisions related to
the commercial loss share agreement expired; however, Branch Bank must reimburse the FDIC for realized gains and recoveries through
September 2017. Refer to Note 3 “Securities” and Note 4 “Loans and ACL” for additional information. The
FDIC loss share receivable includes amounts related to net reimbursements expected to be received from the FDIC and is included
in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recognized amounts related to expected future payments to the FDIC, including
any amounts resulting from the aggregate loss calculation, are included in Accounts payable and other liabilities.

The FDIC’s obligation to reimburse Branch Bank with respect
to loss sharing agreements began with the first dollar of loss incurred by BB&T on the covered assets. Covered assets, excluding
certain non-agency MBS, are subject to a stated threshold of $5 billion that provides for the FDIC to reimburse Branch Bank for
(1) 80% of cumulative net losses incurred up to $5 billion and (2) 95% of net losses in excess of $5 billion. Gains and recoveries
on covered assets will offset losses, or be paid to the FDIC, at the applicable loss share percentage in effect at the time of
gain/recovery. Losses and gains on certain non-agency MBS are to be shared with the FDIC at 95% of such losses/gains. At the conclusion
of the loss share period in 2019, should actual aggregate losses, excluding securities, be less than an amount determined in accordance
with these agreements, BB&T will pay the FDIC a portion of the difference.

The income statement effect of the changes in the FDIC loss share
receivable/payable includes the accretion due to discounting and changes in expected net reimbursements. Decreases in expected
net reimbursements, including the amounts expected to be paid to the FDIC as a result of the aggregate loss calculation, are recognized
in income prospectively over the term of the loss share agreements consistent with the approach taken to recognize increases in
cash flows on acquired loans. Increases in expected reimbursements are recognized in income in the same period that the provision
for credit losses for the related loans is recognized. Subsequent to the recognition of ALLL related to specific assets, any decrease
in expected net reimbursement would be recognized in income in the same period that the provision for loan losses for the related
loans is released.


TableofContents

Premises and Equipment

Premises, equipment, capital leases and leasehold improvements are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is stated at cost. In addition, purchased software and costs
of computer software developed for internal use are capitalized provided certain criteria are met. Depreciation and amortization
are computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms, including certain renewals that were deemed probable
at lease inception, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Capitalized leases are amortized using the same methods
as premises and equipment over the estimated useful lives or lease terms, whichever is less. Obligations under capital leases are
amortized using the interest method to allocate payments between principal reduction and interest expense. Rent expense and rental
income on operating leases is recorded using the straight-line method over the appropriate lease terms.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes have been provided when different accounting
methods have been used in determining income for income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized based on future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. In the event of changes in the tax laws, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted in the period of the enactment of those changes, with the cumulative effects included in the current year’s
income tax provision. Net deferred tax liabilities are included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Interest and penalties related to income taxes are recognized as
a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivative Financial Instruments

A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows,
and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. These instruments include
interest rate swaps, caps, floors, collars, financial forwards and futures contracts, swaptions, when-issued securities, foreign
exchange contracts and options written and purchased. BB&T uses derivatives primarily to manage economic risk related to securities,
commercial loans, MSRs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. BB&T also uses derivatives
to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients. The fair value of derivatives in a gain or loss position is included in other
assets or liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral posted for derivative instruments in a
loss position is included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

BB&T classifies its derivative financial instruments as either
(1) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recorded asset or liability (“fair value hedge”), (2)
a hedge of an exposure to changes in the cash flows of a recognized asset, liability or forecasted transaction (“cash flow
hedge”), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a subsidiary, or (4) derivatives not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair
value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in current period earnings. BB&T has master netting agreements
with the derivatives dealers with which it does business, but BB&T presents gross assets and liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

BB&T uses the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness.
At inception and at least quarterly over the life of the hedge, BB&T documents its analysis of actual and expected hedge effectiveness.
This analysis includes techniques such as regression analysis and hypothetical derivatives to demonstrate that the hedge has been,
and is expected to be, highly effective in off-setting corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
For a qualifying fair value hedge, changes in the value of the derivatives that have been highly effective as hedges are recognized
in current period earnings along with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the designated hedged item attributable to
the risk being hedged. For a qualifying cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivatives that have been highly effective
are recognized in OCI until the related cash flows from the hedged item are recognized in earnings.

For either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, ineffectiveness
may be recognized to the extent that changes in the value of the derivative instruments do not perfectly offset changes in the
value of the hedged items. If the hedge ceases to be highly effective, BB&T discontinues hedge accounting and recognizes the
interim changes in fair value in current period earnings. If a derivative that qualifies as a fair value or cash flow hedge is
terminated or de-designated, the realized or then unrealized gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the hedged item
(fair value hedge) or in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings (cash flow hedge). Immediate recognition in earnings
is required upon sale or extinguishment of the hedged item (fair value hedge) or if it is probable that the hedged cash flows will
not occur (cash flow hedge).


TableofContents

Derivatives used to manage economic risk not designated as hedges
primarily represent economic risk management instruments of MSRs and mortgage banking operations, with gains or losses included
in mortgage banking income. In connection with its mortgage banking activities, BB&T enters into loan commitments to fund residential
mortgage loans at specified rates and for specified periods of time. To the extent that BB&T’s interest rate lock commitments
relate to loans that will be held for sale upon funding, they are also accounted for as derivatives, with gains or losses included
in mortgage banking income. Gains and losses on other derivatives used to manage economic risk are primarily associated with client
derivative activity and are included in other income.

Credit risk resulting from derivatives arises when amounts receivable
from a counterparty exceed those payable to the same counterparty. The risk of loss with respect to over-the-counter derivatives,
eligible margin loans and repurchase-style transactions is addressed by subjecting counterparties to a credit review and approval
process similar to the process in making loans or other extensions of credit and/or by requiring collateral.

Derivative dealer counterparties operate under agreements to provide
cash and/or highly liquid securities on a daily basis for unsecured credit exposure beyond negotiated limits, while client derivatives
that are associated with loans are cross-collateralized with the loan.

BB&T only transacts with dealer counterparties that are national
market makers with strong credit standings and requires liquid collateral to secure credit exposure. Due to these factors, the
fair value of derivatives with dealer counterparties is primarily based on the interest rate mark of each trade. The fair value
of interest rate derivatives with clients includes a credit valuation adjustment.

Collateral obtained to secure margin loans includes equities, corporate
and municipal securities, and repurchase-style transactions are generally secured by government and agency securities. The value
of collateral for margin loans and repurchase-style transactions is monitored daily with settlement required when changes in value
exceed established limits by counterparty. Due to the liquid nature of collateral, the frequency of transactions and collateral
monitoring, a reserve for credit loss is established only when a risk of loss is identified.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net
assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) in transactions accounted for as acquisitions. BB&T allocates goodwill
to the reporting unit(s) that receives significant benefits from the acquisition. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment
during the fourth quarter of each year and more frequently if circumstances exist that indicate a possible reduction in the fair
value of the business below its carrying value. BB&T measures impairment using the present value of estimated future cash flows
based upon available information. Discount rates are based upon the cost of capital specific to the industry in which the reporting
unit operates. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second analysis is performed to measure the
fair value of all assets and liabilities. If, based on the second analysis, it is determined that the fair value of the assets
and liabilities of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, BB&T would recognize impairment for the excess of carrying
value over fair value.

CDI and other intangible assets include premiums paid for acquisitions
of core deposits and other identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined to have
finite lives, are amortized based upon the estimated economic benefits received.

MSRs

BB&T has two primary classes of MSRs for which it separately
manages the economic risks: residential and commercial. Residential MSRs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily
at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income. Various derivative instruments are
used to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions of the
residential MSRs. Commercial MSRs are recorded as other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of cost or market
and are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period, that net servicing income is expected to be received based on
projections of the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows. The amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows
are updated based on actual results and updated projections. BB&T periodically evaluates its commercial MSRs for impairment.


TableofContents

Equity-Based Compensation

BB&T maintains various equity-based compensation plans that
provide for the granting of stock options (incentive and nonqualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance
units and performance shares to selected employees and directors. BB&T values share-based awards at the grant date fair value
and recognizes the expense over the requisite service period taking into account retirement eligibility.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

BB&T offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit
plans to employees. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation
methods and assumptions. The discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference
to a high quality corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plan such as projected cash flow patterns
and payment durations. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on the expected returns for each major asset class
in which the plan invests, adjusted for the weight of each asset class in the target mix.

Insurance Income

Insurance commission revenue is generally recognized at the later
of the billing date or the effective date of the related insurance policies. Insurance premiums from underwriting activities are
recognized as income over the policy term. The portion of premiums that will be earned in the future is deferred and included in
other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Segments

Segment results are presented based on internal management accounting
policies that were designed to support BB&T’s strategic objectives. The Other, Treasury and Corporate segment includes
financial data from subsidiaries below the quantitative and qualitative thresholds requiring disclosure. Refer to Note 20 “Operating
Segments”

for additional disclosures regarding BB&T’s segments.

Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New Accounting
Pronouncements

During February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Leases

.
The new guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities related to certain operating leases on the balance sheet.
The new guidance also requires additional disclosures by lessees and contains targeted changes to accounting by lessors. This guidance
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

During January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Financial
Instruments

. The new guidance requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized
in net income, excluding equity investments that are consolidated or accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The new
guidance allows equity investments without readily determinable fair values to be measured at cost minus impairment, with a qualitative
assessment required to identify impairment. The new guidance also requires public companies to use exit prices to measure the fair
value of financial instruments, eliminates the disclosure requirements related to measurement assumptions for the fair value of
instruments measured at amortized cost and requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities based on form and
measurement category. In addition, for liabilities measured at fair value under the fair value option, the changes in fair value
due to changes in instrument-specific credit risk should be recognized in OCI. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine
the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

During September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Business
Combinations

. The new guidance requires acquirers to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts (that are identified during
the measurement period) in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The new guidance also requires
such amounts to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. BB&T early adopted this guidance effective September
30, 2015. The adoption of this guidance was not material to the consolidated financial statements.

During May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Insurance

.
The new guidance requires insurance companies to provide additional disclosures about the liability for unpaid claims and claim
adjustment expenses. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. BB&T’s insurance
operations primarily consist of agency/broker transactions; therefore, the adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material
to the consolidated financial statements.


TableofContents

During May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Fair
Value Measurement

. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to classify in the fair value hierarchy any investments for
which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using the practical expedient. This guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected
to be material to the consolidated financial statements.

During April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Internal-Use
Software

. Under the new guidance, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account
for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing
arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This guidance
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of
this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements.

During April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Debt
Issuance Costs

. The new guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. This guidance is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected
to be material to the consolidated financial statements.

During February 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Consolidation

.
The new guidance provides an additional requirement for a limited partnership or similar entity to qualify as a voting interest
entity, amending the criteria for consolidating such an entity and eliminating the deferral provided under previous guidance for
investment companies. In addition, the new guidance amends the criteria for evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or service
provider as a variable interest and amends the criteria for evaluating the effect of fee arrangements and related parties on a
VIE primary beneficiary determination. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements.

During May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to

Revenue
from Contracts with Customers

. This guidance supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition

, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Accounting Standards Codification. The
guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. During August
2015, the FASB provided a one-year deferral of the effective date; therefore, the guidance is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact
on its consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2015, the Company adopted new guidance related
to

Receivables

. The new guidance requires that a government guaranteed mortgage loan be derecognized and that a separate
other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if certain conditions are met. The adoption of this guidance was not material to
the consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2015, the Company adopted new guidance related
to

Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions and Repurchase Financings

. The new guidance changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity
transactions to secured borrowing accounting. The guidance also requires separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset
executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which results in secured borrowing accounting
for the repurchase agreement. The adoption of this guidance was not material to the consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2015, the Company adopted new guidance related
to

Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects.

The Company used the retrospective method of adoption and has elected
the proportional amortization method to account for these investments. The proportional amortization method allows an entity to
amortize the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the amount of tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognize
the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of the provision for income taxes. For prior periods, amortization
expense related to qualifying investments in low income housing tax credits was reclassified from other income to provision for
income taxes, and the amount of amortization and tax benefits recognized was revised as a result of the adoption of the proportional
amortization method. See Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies” for the impact of the adoption of this guidance.

NOTE 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc.

On August 1, 2015, BB&T acquired all of the outstanding stock
of Susquehanna, a FHC organized in 1982 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Susquehanna conducted its business
operations primarily through its commercial bank subsidiary, Susquehanna Bank, which was merged into Branch Bank. Susquehanna also
operated other subsidiaries in the mid-Atlantic region to provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking and financial products
and services. In addition to Susquehanna Bank, Susquehanna operated a trust and investment company, an asset management company,
an investment advisory and brokerage firm, a property and casualty insurance brokerage company and a vehicle leasing company. Susquehanna
had 245 banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia. BB&T acquired Susquehanna in order to increase
BB&T’s market share in these areas.

The acquisition of Susquehanna constituted a business combination.
Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are presented at their fair values in the table below. The determination
of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other
future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. These fair value estimates are considered preliminary
and are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information becomes available.
Immaterial amounts of the intangible assets recognized are deductible for income tax purposes.

TableofContents

The following is a description of the methods used to determine
the fair values of significant assets and liabilities presented above.

Cash, due from banks and federal funds sold:

The carrying
amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets.

Securities:

Fair values for securities are based on quoted
market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are based on observable inputs
including quoted market prices for similar instruments, quoted market prices that are not in an active market or other inputs that
are observable in the market. In the absence of observable inputs, fair value is estimated based on pricing models and/or discounted
cash flow methodologies.

Loans and leases:

Fair values for loans were based on a discounted
cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral, classification status, fixed or
variable interest rate, term of loan, amortization status and current discount rates. Loans were grouped together according to
similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The discount rates used for
loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity concerns.
The discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows.

CDI:

This intangible asset represents the value of the relationships
with deposit customers. The fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration
to expected customer attrition rates, cost of the deposit base, reserve requirements and the net maintenance cost attributable
to customer deposits. The CDI is being amortized over 10 years based upon the estimated economic benefits received.

Deposits:

The fair values used for the demand and savings
deposits by definition equal the amount payable on demand at the acquisition date. The fair values for time deposits are estimated
using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates
on such time deposits.

Debt:

The fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated
based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted
cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.


TableofContents

Other Bank and Branch Acquisitions

The following table summarizes the purchase price allocations for
certain bank and branch acquisitions. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are presented at their estimated
fair values. In many cases, the determination of these fair values required management to make estimates about discount rates,
future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change.
The fair value estimates for the current-year acquisitions are considered preliminary and are subject to change for up to one year
after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information becomes available.

The acquisition of The Bank of Kentucky provided 32 additional retail
branches. The UPB of loans acquired from The Bank of Kentucky was $1.3 billion, and immaterial amounts of the intangible assets
recognized are deductible for income tax purposes.

BB&T has reached an agreement to acquire National Penn Bancshares,
Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, which is currently expected to occur during 2016.

Non-Bank Activity

During the second quarter of 2015, BB&T purchased additional
ownership interest in AmRisc, LP from the noncontrolling owners for cash and ownership of American Coastal. Since BB&T held
a controlling interest in AmRisc, LP prior to this transaction, the total consideration less the establishment of a deferred tax
asset was recognized as a charge to shareholders’ equity. BB&T will continue to consolidate AmRisc, LP and recognize
a noncontrolling interest for the remaining interests held by the noncontrolling owners. The transfer of the ownership of American
Coastal was accounted for as a sale, and the resulting pre-tax loss is included in other income in the Consolidated Statements
of Income. The following table summarizes these transactions:

BB&T transferred $517 million of HTM securities to AFS during
the third quarter of 2015. These securities, which were sold by the end of the third quarter, represented investments in student
loans for which there was a significant increase in risk weighting as a result of the implementation of Basel III.

The fair value of securities acquired from the FDIC included non-agency
MBS of $768 million and $931 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and states and political subdivisions
securities of $296 million and $312 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Effective October 1, 2014,
securities subject to the commercial loss sharing agreement with the FDIC related to the Colonial acquisition were no longer covered
by loss sharing; however, any gains on the sale of these securities through September 30, 2017 would be shared with the FDIC. Since
these securities are in a significant unrealized gain position, they continue to be effectively covered as any declines in the
unrealized gains of the securities down to a contractually specified amount would reduce the liability to the FDIC at the applicable
percentage. The contractually-specified amount is the acquisition date fair value less any paydowns, redemptions or maturities
and OTTI and totaled approximately $492 million at December 31, 2015. Any further declines below the contractually-specified amount
would not be covered.

Certain investments in marketable debt securities and MBS issued
by FNMA and FHLMC exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2015. The FNMA investments had total amortized cost
and fair value of $12.2 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively. The FHLMC investments had total amortized cost and fair value
of $5.8 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.

The following table reflects changes in credit losses on securities
with OTTI (excluding securities acquired from the FDIC) where a portion of the unrealized loss was recognized in OCI:

Periodic reviews are conducted to identify and evaluate each investment
with an unrealized loss for OTTI. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than
its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded, net of tax, in AOCI for
AFS securities. The unrealized losses on GSE securities and agency MBS were the result of increases in market interest rates compared
to the date the securities were acquired rather than the credit quality of the issuers.

Cash flow modeling is used to evaluate non-agency MBS in an unrealized
loss position for potential credit impairment. These models give consideration to long-term macroeconomic factors applied to current
security default rates, prepayment rates and recovery rates and security-level performance. At December 31, 2015, one non-agency
MBS had an immaterial amount of other than temporary credit impairment.

At December 31, 2015, $39 million of the unrealized loss on municipal
securities was the result of fair value hedge basis adjustments that are a component of amortized cost. Municipal securities in
an unrealized loss position are evaluated for credit impairment through a qualitative analysis of issuer performance and the primary
source of repayment. At December 31, 2015, the evaluation of municipal securities did not indicate any municipal securities with
other than temporary credit impairment.

NOTE 4. Loans and ACL

During the first quarter of 2014, approximately $8.3 billion of
nonguaranteed, closed-end, first and second lien position residential mortgage loans, along with the related allowance, were transferred
from direct retail lending to residential mortgage to facilitate compliance with a series of new rules related to mortgage servicing
associated with first and second lien position mortgages collateralized by real estate.

During the third quarter of 2014, approximately $550 million of
loans, which were primarily performing residential mortgage TDRs, with a related ALLL of $57 million were sold for a gain of $42
million. During the fourth quarter of 2014, approximately $140 million of loans, which were primarily residential mortgage NPLs,
with a related ALLL of $19 million were sold for a gain of $24 million. Both gains were recognized as reductions to the provision
for credit losses.

Effective October 1, 2014, loans subject to the commercial loss
sharing agreement with the FDIC related to the Colonial acquisition were no longer covered by loss sharing. At December 31, 2015,
these loans had a carrying value of $273 million, a UPB of $462 million and an allowance of $41 million and are included in PCI.
Loans with a carrying value of $539 million at December 31, 2015 continue to be covered by loss sharing and are included in PCI.

The 2013 adjustments to goodwill within Community Banking and Insurance
Services reflect the finalization of valuations for certain assets and liabilities of the above acquisitions. The 2013 adjustment
to Specialized Lending primarily represents the goodwill associated with a subsidiary that was sold.

During 2014, the transfer of closed-end, first and second lien position
residential mortgage loans from Community Banking to Residential Mortgage Banking resulted in a reallocation of the related goodwill,
which is included in other adjustments in the above table.

FHA-insured mortgage loan reserve



During June 2014, BB&T received notice from the HUD-OIG that
BB&T had been selected for an audit/survey to assess BB&T's compliance with FHA loan origination and quality control requirements.
In late 2014 and in 2015, BB&T received subpoenas from the HUD-OIG and the Department of Justice seeking additional information
regarding its lending practices in connection with loans insured by the FHA. BB&T is cooperating with the investigation. While
the outcome of the investigation is unknown and neither the Department of Justice nor the HUD-OIG has asserted any claims, similar
reviews and related matters with other financial institutions have resulted in cash settlements and other remedial actions. BB&T
identified a potential exposure related to losses incurred by the FHA on defaulted loans that ranges from $25 million to $105 million
and recognized an $85 million charge during 2014. The income statement impact of this adjustment was included in other expense
on the Consolidated Statements of lncome. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and the estimates of this exposure
are subject to the application of significant judgment and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.

During 2014, BB&T also recognized a $33 million adjustment related
to the indemnification reserves for mortgage loans sold, which represents an increase in estimated losses that may be incurred
on FHA-insured mortgage loans that have not yet defaulted. The income statement impact of this adjustment was included in loan-related
expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Payments made to date for recourse exposure on residential mortgage
loans sold with recourse liability have been immaterial.

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not
be considered to be predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear.
Also, in the above table, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated
without changing any other assumption; while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may magnify
or counteract the effect of the change.

Dividends on the preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are payable
quarterly, in arrears. For each issuance, BB&T issued depositary shares, each of which represents a fractional ownership interest
in a share of the Company’s preferred stock. The preferred stock has no stated maturity and redemption is solely at the option
of the Company in whole, but not in part, upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined. In addition,
the preferred stock may be redeemed in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date after five years from the date of issuance.
Under current rules, any redemption of the preferred stock is subject to prior approval of the FRB. The preferred stock is not
subject to any sinking fund or other obligations of the Company.

Equity-Based Compensation Plans

At December 31, 2015, options, restricted shares and RSUs were outstanding
from equity-based compensation plans that have been approved by shareholders. Those plans are intended to assist the Company in
recruiting and retaining employees, directors and independent contractors and to associate the interests of eligible participants
with those of BB&T and its shareholders.

The majority of outstanding awards
and awards available to be issued relate to plans that allow for accelerated vesting of awards for holders who retire and have
met all retirement eligibility requirements or in connection with certain other events.

Until
vested, certain of these awards are subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances.

The following table provides a summary of the equity-based compensation
plans:

The fair value of RSUs is based on the common stock price on the
grant date less the present value of expected dividends that will be foregone during the vesting period. The fair value of options
is measured on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Substantially all awards are granted in February of
each year. Grants to non-executive employees primarily consist of RSUs.

NOTE 12. Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 2015, BB&T adopted new guidance related
to the accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. For periods prior to January 1, 2015, amortization
expense related to qualifying investments in low income housing tax credits was reclassified from other income to provision for
income taxes, and the amount of amortization and tax benefits recognized was revised as a result of the adoption of the proportional
amortization method.

The components of the income tax provision are as follows:

On a periodic basis, BB&T evaluates its income tax positions
based on tax laws and regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. This evaluation
takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities’ examinations of BB&T’s tax returns, recent positions
taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions and the overall tax environment in relation to tax-advantaged transactions.

The Company had $181 million, $210 million and $213 million in liabilities
for tax-related interest and penalties recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
The amount of net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income
was a benefit of $29 million for 2015, an immaterial amount for 2014 and expense of $176 million for 2013.

The IRS has completed its Federal income tax examinations of BB&T
through 2010. Various years remain subject to examination by state taxing authorities.

In February 2010, BB&T received an IRS statutory notice of deficiency for tax years 2002-2007 asserting a liability for
taxes, penalties and interest of approximately $892 million related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits and other deductions
claimed by a subsidiary in connection with a financing transaction. BB&T paid the disputed tax, penalties and interest
in March 2010 and filed a lawsuit seeking a refund in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. During September 2013, the court denied
the refund claim. These developments and other smaller matters resulted in $516 million of income tax adjustments during 2013.
BB&T appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. During May 2015, the appeals court overturned
a portion of the earlier ruling, resulting in the recognition of a $107 million income tax benefit during the second quarter.
The remainder of the decision was affirmed. During September 2015, BB&T filed a petition requesting the case be heard
by the U.S. Supreme Court. A decision to hear the case has not been made at this time.

It is reasonably possible that the litigation associated with the
financing transaction may conclude within the next twelve months; however, it is also possible that the appeals process could take
longer than one year. Changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest could result in a benefit of up
to approximately $596 million.

NOTE 13. Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans

BB&T provides a defined benefit retirement plan qualified under
the IRC that covers most employees. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement and the employee's compensation during
the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment.

In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain
key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the IRC. Although technically
unfunded plans, a Rabbi Trust and insurance policies on the lives of certain of the covered employees are available to finance
future benefits.

The following actuarial assumptions were used to determine net periodic pension costs for the qualified pension plan:

TableofContents

The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit
obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, BB&T considers long-term compound annualized returns
of historical market data for each asset category, as well as historical actual returns on the plan assets. Using this reference
information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected long-term
rate of return for the plan based on target asset allocations contained in BB&T's Investment Policy Statement. For 2016, the
expected rate of return on plan assets is 7.0%.

Financial data relative to qualified and nonqualified defined benefit
pension plans is summarized in the following tables for the years indicated. On the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the qualified
pension plan prepaid asset is recorded as a component of other assets and the nonqualified pension plans accrued liability is recorded
as a component of other liabilities. The data is calculated using an actuarial measurement date of December 31.

BB&T makes contributions to the qualified pension plan in amounts
between the minimum required for funding and the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. BB&T made discretionary
contributions of $280 million during the first quarter of 2016. Management may make additional contributions in 2016. For the nonqualified
plans, the employer contributions are based on benefit payments.

BB&T's primary total return objective is to achieve returns
that, over the long term, will fund retirement liabilities and provide for the desired plan benefits in a manner that satisfies
the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The plan assets have a long-term time horizon
that runs concurrent with the average life expectancy of the participants. As such, the Plan can assume a time horizon that extends
well beyond a full market cycle, and can assume an above-average level of risk, as measured by the standard deviation of annual
return. It is expected, however, that both professional investment management and sufficient portfolio diversification will smooth
volatility and help to generate a reasonable consistency of return. The investments are broadly diversified among economic sector,
industry, quality and size in order to reduce risk and to produce incremental return. Within approved guidelines and restrictions,
investment managers have wide discretion over the timing and selection of individual investments.


TableofContents

BB&T periodically reviews its asset allocation and investment
policy and makes changes to its target asset allocation. BB&T has established guidelines within each asset category to ensure
the appropriate balance of risk and reward. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the target asset allocations for the plan assets
included a range of 30% to 40% for U.S. equity securities, 10% to 18% for international equity securities, 35% to 50% for fixed
income securities, and 0% to 12% for alternative investments, which include real estate, hedge funds, private equities and commodities,
with any remainder to be held in cash equivalents. The plan may hold BB&T common stock up to 10% of its assets, subject to
the target range for total U.S. equity securities.

The fair value of the pension plan assets at December 31, 2015 and
2014 by asset category are reflected in the following tables.

stock valued at $113 million and $117 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. International equity securities include
a common/commingled fund that consists of assets from several accounts, pooled together, to reduce management and administration
costs. Total plan assets exclude accrued income of $18 million and $23 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Defined Contribution Plans

BB&T offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other defined contribution
plans that permit employees to contribute from 1% to 50% of their cash compensation. For full-time employees who are 21 years of
age or older with one year or more of service, BB&T makes matching contributions of up to 6% of the employee's compensation.
BB&T's contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan and nonqualified defined contribution plans totaled $114 million, $103 million
and $102 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. BB&T also offers defined contribution
plans to certain employees of subsidiaries who do not participate in the 401(k) Savings Plan.

Other Benefits

There are various other employment contracts, deferred compensation
arrangements and covenants not to compete with selected members of management and certain retirees. These plans and their obligations
are not material to the financial statements.

NOTE 14. Commitments and Contingencies

BB&T utilizes a variety of financial instruments to meet the
financing needs of clients and to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments
to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees and derivatives. BB&T also has commitments to fund certain affordable
housing investments and contingent liabilities related to certain sold loans.

Commitments to extend, originate or purchase credit are primarily
lines of credit to businesses and consumers and have specified rates and maturity dates. Many of these commitments also have adverse
change clauses, which allow BB&T to cancel the commitment due to deterioration in the borrowers’ creditworthiness.

Letters of credit and financial guarantees written are unconditional
commitments issued by BB&T to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued
to support borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuance, bond financing and similar transactions, the majority of
which are to tax exempt entities. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees is essentially the same as that
involved in extending loans to clients and as such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary.

BB&T invests in certain affordable housing and historic building
rehabilitation projects throughout its market area as a means of supporting local communities. BB&T receives tax credits related
to these investments. BB&T typically acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating
or financial policies of the partnerships. BB&T typically provides financing during the construction and development of the
properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project. Tax
credits are subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level. BB&T’s
maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding balance,
future funding commitments and any related loans to the entity. Loans to these entities are underwritten in substantially the same
manner as are other loans and are generally secured.

Effective January 1, 2015, BB&T adopted new guidance related
to

Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects.

amount of investments and future funding commitments made.

A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows,
and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or interest rate. For additional disclosures related to
BB&T’s derivatives refer to Note 18 “Derivative Financial Instruments.”

BB&T has sold certain mortgage-related loans that contain recourse
provisions. These provisions generally require BB&T to reimburse the investor for a share of any loss that is incurred after
the disposal of the property. BB&T also issues standard representations and warranties related to mortgage loan sales to GSEs.
Refer to Note 7 “Loan Servicing” for additional disclosures related to these exposures.

In the ordinary course of business, BB&T indemnifies its officers
and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from pending litigation. BB&T also issues
standard representations and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities
and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnification arrangements provide similar indemnifications to
BB&T. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T does not believe that any payments related to these
guarantees would materially change the financial position or results of operations of BB&T.

Legal Proceedings

The nature of BB&T’s business ordinarily results in a
certain amount of claims, litigation, investigations and legal and administrative cases and proceedings, all of which are considered
incidental to the normal conduct of business. BB&T believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in
its currently outstanding legal proceedings and, with respect to such legal proceedings, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously,
litigating or settling cases according to management’s judgment as to what is in the best interests of BB&T and its shareholders.

On at least a quarterly basis, liabilities and contingencies in
connection with outstanding legal proceedings are assessed utilizing the latest information available. For those matters where
it is probable that BB&T will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, a liability is recorded
in the consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments
on at least a quarterly basis. For other matters, where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, legal
reserves are not accrued. While the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available,
advice of counsel and available insurance coverage, management believes that the established legal reserves are adequate and the
liabilities arising from legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated
results of operations or consolidated cash flows. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that
the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the consolidated financial position, consolidated
results of operations or consolidated cash flows of BB&T.

Pledged Assets

Certain assets were pledged to secure municipal deposits, securities
sold under agreements to repurchase, borrowings and borrowing capacity, subject to any applicable asset discount, at the FHLB and
FRB as well as for other purposes as required or permitted by law. The following table provides the total carrying amount of pledged
assets by asset type, of which the majority are pursuant to agreements that do not permit the other party to sell or repledge the
collateral. Assets related to employee benefit plans have been excluded from the following table.

NOTE 15. Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions

Branch Bank is required by the FRB to maintain reserve balances in the form of vault cash or deposits with the FRB based on
specified percentages of certain deposit types, subject to various adjustments. At December 31, 2015, the net reserve requirement
was met with vault cash.

Branch Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount
of dividends it can pay. In addition, both BB&T and Branch Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to
the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain “well-capitalized”
under the prompt corrective action regulations. BB&T does not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially
affect the ability of Branch Bank to pay dividends.

BB&T is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered
by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory—and possibly
additional discretionary—actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial
statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet
specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated
pursuant to regulatory directives. BB&T’s capital amounts and classification also are subject to qualitative judgments
by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. BB&T is in full compliance with these requirements.
Banking regulations also identify five capital categories for IDIs: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, BB&T and Branch Bank were classified
as “well-capitalized,” and management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to year end that
would change this designation.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital
adequacy require BB&T to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to
risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio).

Risk-based capital ratios, which include Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital, are calculated based on regulatory
guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.

The transfer of funds in the form of dividends, loans or advances
from bank subsidiaries to the Parent Company is restricted. Federal law requires loans to the Parent Company or its affiliates
to be secured and at market terms and generally limits loans to the Parent Company or an individual affiliate to 10% of Branch
Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. In the aggregate, loans to the Parent Company and all affiliates cannot exceed 20%
of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.

Dividend payments to the Parent Company by Branch Bank are subject
to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends from Branch Bank
to the Parent Company are limited by rules which compare dividends to net income for regulatory-defined periods. Furthermore, dividends
are restricted by regulatory minimum capital constraints.

NOTE 17. Fair Value Disclosures

Accounting standards define fair value as the exchange price that
would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous
market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three level valuation input hierarchy.

The following discussion focuses on the valuation techniques and
significant inputs for Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities.

A third-party pricing service is generally utilized in determining
the fair value of the securities portfolio. Management independently evaluates the fair values provided by the pricing service
through comparisons to other external pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the pricing service and other
third party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on any security sales to the daily pricing
information received from the pricing service. Fair value measurements are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were
developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads
and broker quotes. As described by security type below, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be applicable. In
the event that market observable data was not available, which would generally occur due to the lack of an active market for a
given security, the valuation of the security would be subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management.

Trading securities:

Trading securities include various types
of debt and equity securities, primarily consisting of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, GSEs, or states and political
subdivisions. The valuation techniques used for these investments are more fully discussed below.

U.S. Treasury securities:

Treasury securities are valued
using quoted prices in active over the counter markets.

Agency MBS:

GSE pass-through securities are valued using
market-based pricing matrices that reference observable inputs including benchmark TBA security pricing and yield curves that were
estimated based on U.S. Treasury yields and certain floating rate indices. The pricing matrices for these securities may also give
consideration to pool-specific data supplied directly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using market-based pricing matrices that
are based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics
of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above.

States and political subdivisions:

These securities are valued
using market-based pricing matrices that reference observable inputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer spreads, material event
notices and benchmark yield curves.

Non-agency MBS:

Pricing matrices for these securities are
based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics
of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above.


TableofContents

Other securities:

These securities consist primarily of mutual
funds and corporate bonds. These securities are valued based on a review of quoted market prices for assets as well as through
the various other inputs discussed previously.

Acquired from FDIC securities:

Securities acquired from the
FDIC consist of re-remic non-agency MBS, municipal securities and non-agency MBS. State and political subdivision securities and
certain non-agency MBS acquired from the FDIC are valued in a manner similar to the approach described above for those asset classes.
The re-remic non-agency MBS, which are categorized as Level 3, are valued based on broker dealer quotes that reflected certain
unobservable market inputs.

LHFS:

Certain mortgage loans are originated to be sold to
investors, which are carried at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by
similar types of loans. The changes in fair value of these assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to
loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage LHFS.

Residential MSRs:

Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS
valuation model to project cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates.
The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates,
late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared
to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, other observable market data.

Derivative assets and liabilities:

The fair values of derivatives
are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data.
The fair values of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as Level
3, are based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that are not expected to fund and include the value attributable
to the net servicing fees.

Private equity and similar investments:

Private equity and
similar investments are measured at fair value based on the investment’s net asset value. In many cases there are no observable
market values for these investments and therefore management must estimate the fair value based on a comparison of the operating
performance of the company to multiples in the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires significant judgment, and
actual values in a sale could differ materially from those estimated.

Securities sold short:

Securities sold short represent debt
securities sold short that are entered into as a hedging strategy for the purposes of supporting institutional and retail client
trading activities.

BB&T’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels
as of the end of a reporting period. Transfers in and out of Level 3 are shown in the preceding tables. There were no transfers
between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2015, 2014 or 2013.

BB&T’s private equity and similar investments are primarily
in SBIC qualified funds, which focus on equity and subordinated debt investments in privately-held middle market companies. These
investments generally are not redeemable and distributions are received as the underlying assets of the funds liquidate. The timing
of distributions, which are expected to occur on various dates through 2026, is uncertain and dependent on various events such
as recapitalizations, refinance transactions and ownership changes, among others. Excluding the investment of future funds, BB&T
estimates these investments have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years; however, the timing and amount of
distributions may vary significantly. As of December 31, 2015, restrictions on the ability to sell the investments include, but
are not limited to, consent of a majority member or general partner approval for transfer of ownership. BB&T’s investments
are spread over numerous privately-held middle market companies, and thus the sensitivity to a change in fair value for any single
investment is limited. The significant unobservable inputs for these investments are EBITDA multiples that ranged from 5x to 12x,
with a weighted average of 8x, at December 31, 2015.

Refer to Note 2 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for
fair value measurements related to acquisitions.

For financial instruments not recorded at fair value, estimates
of fair value are based on relevant market data and information about the instrument. Values obtained relate to one trading unit
without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership, possible tax ramifications, estimated
transaction costs that may result from bulk sales or the relationship between various instruments.

An active market does not exist for certain financial instruments.
Fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current economic conditions, currency and interest rate risk characteristics,
loss experience and other factors. Many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot
be determined with precision. Therefore, the fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument. In addition, changes in assumptions could
significantly affect these fair value estimates. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of these financial
instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash

: For these
short-term instruments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair values.

HTM securities:

The fair values of HTM securities are based
on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields and securities, TBA prices, reported trades, issuer spreads,
current bids and offers, monthly payment information and collateral performance.

Loans receivable

: The fair values for loans are estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, applying interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms and credit quality,
which are deemed to be indicative of orderly transactions in the current market. For commercial loans and leases, discount rates
may be adjusted to address additional credit risk on lower risk grade instruments. For residential mortgage and other consumer
loans, internal prepayment risk models are used to adjust contractual cash flows. Loans are aggregated into pools of similar terms
and credit quality and discounted using a LIBOR based rate. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair values.

FDIC loss share receivable and payable

: The fair values of
the receivable and payable are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, applying a risk free interest rate that is adjusted
for the uncertainty in the timing and amount of the cash flows. The expected cash flows to/from the FDIC related to loans were
estimated using the same assumptions that were used in determining the accounting values for the related loans. The expected cash
flows to/from the FDIC related to securities are based upon the fair value of the related securities and the payment that would
be required if the securities were sold for that amount. The loss share agreements are not transferrable and, accordingly, there
is no market for the receivable or payable.


TableofContents

Deposit liabilities

: The fair values for demand deposits
are equal to the amount payable on demand. Fair values for CDs are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies
current interest rates to aggregate expected maturities. BB&T has developed long-term relationships with its deposit customers,
commonly referred to as CDIs, that have not been considered in the determination of the deposit liabilities’ fair value.

Short-term borrowings

: The carrying amounts of short-term
borrowings, excluding securities sold short, approximate their fair values.

Long-term debt

: The fair values of long-term debt instruments
are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by
using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.

Contractual commitments

: The fair values of commitments are
estimated using the fees charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and
the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. The fair values of guarantees and letters of credit are estimated based on
the counterparties’ creditworthiness and average default rates for loan products with similar risks. These respective fair
value measurements are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Retail lending commitments are assigned no fair
value as BB&T typically has the ability to cancel such commitments by providing notice to the borrower.

TableofContents

The fair values of derivatives in a gain or loss position are presented
on a gross basis in other assets or other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral posted
for derivatives in a loss position is reported as restricted cash. Derivatives with dealer counterparties at both the bank and
the parent company are governed by the terms of ISDA Master netting agreements and Credit Support Annexes. The ISDA Master agreements
allow counterparties to offset trades in a gain against trades in a loss to determine net exposure and allows for the right of
setoff in the event of either a default or an additional termination event. Credit Support Annexes govern the terms of daily collateral
posting practices. Collateral practices mitigate the potential loss impact to affected parties by requiring liquid collateral to
be posted on a scheduled basis to secure the aggregate net unsecured exposure. In addition to collateral, the right of setoff allows
counterparties to offset net derivative values with a defaulting party against certain other contractual receivables from or obligations
due to the defaulting party in determining the net termination amount. No portion of the change in fair value of derivatives designated
as hedges has been excluded from effectiveness testing. The ineffective portion was immaterial for all periods presented.

The following table provides a summary of derivative strategies and the related accounting treatment:

Cash Flow Hedges

Fair Value Hedges

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges

Risk exposure

Variability in cash flows of interest payments on floating rate business loans, overnight funding and various LIBOR funding instruments.

Losses in value on fixed rate long-term debt, CDs, FHLB advances, loans and state and political subdivision securities due to changes in interest rates.

Risk associated with an asset or liability, including mortgage banking operations and MSRs, or for client needs. Includes exposure to changes in market rates and conditions subsequent to the interest rate lock and funding date for mortgage loans originated for sale.

Risk management objective

Hedge the variability in the interest payments and receipts on future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to the first unhedged payments and receipts of variable interest.

Convert the fixed rate paid or received to a floating rate, primarily through the use of swaps.

For interest rate lock commitment derivatives and LHFS, use mortgage-based derivatives such as forward commitments and options to mitigate market risk. For MSRs, mitigate the income statement effect of changes in the fair value of the MSRs.

Treatment for portion that is highly effective

Recognized in AOCI until the related cash flows from the hedged item are recognized in earnings.

Recognized in current period income along with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the designated hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged.

Entire change in fair value recognized in current period income.

Treatment for portion that is ineffective

Not applicable

Treatment if hedge ceases to be highly effective or is terminated

Hedge is dedesignated. Effective changes in value that are recorded in AOCI before dedesignation are amortized to yield over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings.

If hedged item remains outstanding, termination proceeds are included in cash flows from financing activities and effective changes in value are reflected as part of the carrying value of the financial instrument and amortized to earnings over its estimated remaining life.

Not applicable

Treatment if transaction is no longer probable of occurring during forecast period or within a short period thereafter

Derivatives Credit Risk – Dealer Counterparties

Credit risk related to derivatives arises when amounts receivable
from a counterparty exceed those payable to the same counterparty. The risk of loss is addressed by subjecting dealer counterparties
to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans or other extensions of credit and by requiring collateral.
Dealer counterparties operate under agreements to provide cash and/or liquid collateral when unsecured loss positions exceed negotiated
limits.

Derivative contracts with dealer counterparties settle on a monthly,
quarterly or semiannual basis, with daily movement of collateral between counterparties required within established netting agreements.
BB&T only transacts with dealer counterparties with strong credit standings.

Derivatives Credit Risk – Central Clearing Parties

Certain derivatives are cleared through central clearing parties
that require initial margin collateral, as well as collateral for trades in a net loss position. Initial margin collateral requirements
are established by central clearing parties on varying bases, with such amounts generally designed to offset the risk of non-payment.
Initial margin is generally calculated by applying the maximum loss experienced in value over a specified time horizon to the portfolio
of existing trades. The central clearing party used for TBA transactions does not post variation margin to the bank.

NOTE 20. Operating Segments

BB&T's operations are divided into six reportable business segments
that have been identified based on BB&T’s organizational structure. The segments require unique technology and marketing
strategies and offer different products and services through a number of distinct branded LOBs. While BB&T is managed as an
integrated organization, individual executive managers are held accountable for the operations of these business segments.

BB&T emphasizes revenue growth by focusing on client service,
sales effectiveness and relationship management along with an organizational focus on referring clients between LOBs. The business
objective is to provide BB&T’s entire suite of products to our clients with the end goal of providing our clients the
best financial experience in the marketplace. The segment results contained herein are presented based on internal management accounting
policies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative
body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP. The performance of the segments is not comparable with BB&T’s
consolidated results or with similar information presented by any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships
of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent
entities.

The management accounting process uses various estimates and allocation
methodologies to measure the performance of the operating segments. To determine financial performance for each segment, BB&T
allocates capital, funding charges and credits, provisions for loan and lease losses, certain noninterest expenses and income tax
provisions to each segment, as applicable. To promote revenue growth, certain revenues are reflected in noninterest income in the
individual segment results and also allocated to Community Banking and Financial Services. These allocated revenues are reflected
in intersegment net referral fees and eliminated in Other, Treasury and Corporate. Additionally certain client groups of Community
Banking have also been identified as clients of other BUs within the business segments. Periodically, existing clients within the
Community Banking segment may be identified and assigned as wealth and private banking clients. At the time of identification,
these clients’ loan and deposit balances are reported in the Financial Services segment from the time of assignment forward.
The net interest income and associated net FTP associated with these customers’ loans and deposits is accounted for in Community
Banking in the respective line categories of net interest income (expense) and net intersegment interest income (expense). For
Commercial Finance and the Wealth Division, NIM and net intersegment interest income have been combined in the net intersegment
interest income (expense) line with an appropriate offsetting amount to the Other, Treasury and Corporate line item to ensure consolidated
totals reflect the Company’s total NIM for loans and deposits. Allocation methodologies are subject to periodic adjustment
as the internal management accounting system is revised and business or product lines within the segments change. Also, because
the development and application of these methodologies is a dynamic process, the financial results presented may be periodically
revised.

BB&T utilizes an FTP system to eliminate the effect of interest
rate risk from the segments’ net interest income because such risk is centrally managed within the Treasury function. The
FTP system credits or charges the segments with the economic value or cost of the funds the segments create or use. The net FTP
credit or charge, which includes intercompany interest income and expense, is reflected as net intersegment income (expense) in
the accompanying tables.


TableofContents

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses is also allocated
to the relevant segments based on management’s assessment of the segments’ credit risks. The allocated provision is
designed to achieve a high degree of correlation between the loan loss experience and the GAAP basis provision at the segment level,
while at the same time providing management with a measure of operating performance that gives appropriate consideration to the
risks inherent in each of the Company’s operating segments. Any over or under allocated provision for loan and lease losses
is reflected in Other, Treasury and Corporate to arrive at consolidated results.

BB&T allocates expenses to the reportable segments based on
various methodologies, including volume and amount of loans and deposits and the number of full-time equivalent employees. Allocation
systems are refined from time to time along with further identification of certain cost pools. These cost pools and refinements
are implemented to provide for improved managerial reporting of cost to the appropriate business segments. A portion of corporate
overhead expense is not allocated, but is retained in corporate accounts and reflected as Other, Treasury and Corporate in
the accompanying tables. The majority of depreciation expense is recorded in support units and allocated to the segments as part
of allocated corporate expense. Income taxes are allocated to the various segments based on taxable income and statutory rates
applicable to the segment.

Community Banking

Community Banking serves individual and business clients by offering
a variety of loan and deposit products and other financial services. Community Banking is primarily responsible for serving client
relationships and, therefore, is credited with certain revenue from the Residential Mortgage Banking, Financial Services, Insurance
Services, Specialized Lending, and other segments, which is reflected in net referral fees.

Residential Mortgage Banking

Residential Mortgage Banking retains and services mortgage loans
originated by Community Banking as well as those purchased from various correspondent originators. Mortgage loan products include
fixed and adjustable rate government and conventional loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential
properties. Substantially all of the properties are owner occupied. BB&T generally retains the servicing rights to loans sold.
Residential Mortgage Banking earns interest on loans held in the warehouse and portfolio, earns fee income from the origination
and servicing of mortgage loans and recognizes gains or losses from the sale of mortgage loans.

Dealer Financial Services

Dealer Financial Services originates loans to consumers on a prime
and nonprime basis for the purchase of automobiles. Such loans are originated on an indirect basis through approved franchised
and independent automobile dealers throughout the BB&T market area and nationally through Regional Acceptance Corporation.
This segment also originates loans for the purchase of boats and recreational vehicles originated through dealers in BB&T’s
market area. In addition, financing and servicing to dealers for their inventories is provided through a joint relationship between
Dealer Financial Services and Community Banking.

Specialized Lending

Specialized Lending consists of BUs and subsidiaries that provide
specialty finance products to consumers and businesses. The BUs include Commercial Finance and Governmental Finance. Commercial
Finance structures and manages asset-based working capital financing, supply chain financing, export-import finance, accounts receivable
management and credit enhancement. Commercial Finance also contains the Mortgage Warehouse Lending business, which provides short-term
lending solutions to finance first-lien residential mortgage LHFS by independent mortgage companies. Governmental Finance provides
tax-exempt financing to meet the capital project needs of local governments. Operating subsidiaries include BB&T Equipment
Finance, which provides equipment leasing largely within BB&T’s banking footprint; Sheffield Financial, a dealer-based
financer of equipment for both small businesses and consumers; Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation, which includes AFCO and
CAFO, insurance premium finance BUs that provide funding to businesses in the United States and Canada and to consumers in certain
markets within BB&T’s banking footprint; and Grandbridge, a full-service commercial mortgage banking lender providing
loans on a national basis. Lendmark Financial Services, a direct consumer finance lending company, was sold during 2013. Branch
Bank clients as well as nonbank clients within and outside BB&T’s primary geographic market area are served by these
LOBs. The Community Banking segment receives credit for referrals to these LOBs with the corresponding charge retained as part
of Other, Treasury and Corporate in the accompanying tables.

Insurance Services

BB&T's insurance agency / brokerage network is the sixth largest
in the world. Insurance Services provides property and casualty, employee benefits and life insurance to businesses and individuals.
It also provides small business and corporate services, such as workers compensation and professional liability, as well as surety
coverage and title insurance. Community Banking and Financial Services receive credit for insurance commissions on referred accounts,
with the corresponding charge retained in the corporate office, which is reflected as part of Other, Treasury and Corporate
in the accompanying tables.

Financial Services

Financial Services provides personal trust administration, estate
planning, investment counseling, wealth management, asset management, corporate retirement services, corporate banking and corporate
trust services. Financial Services also offers clients investment alternatives, including discount brokerage services, equities,
fixed-rate and variable-rate annuities, mutual funds and governmental and municipal bonds through BB&T Investment Services,
Inc.

Financial Services includes BB&T Securities, a full-service
brokerage and investment banking firm that provides services in retail brokerage, equity and debt underwriting, investment advice,
corporate finance and equity research and facilitates the origination, trading and distribution of fixed-income securities and
equity products in both the public and private capital markets. BB&T Securities also has a public finance department that provides
investment banking services, financial advisory services and municipal bond financing to a variety of regional taxable and tax-exempt
issuers.

Financial Services includes a group of consolidated SBIC private
equity and mezzanine investment funds that invest in privately owned middle-market operating companies to facilitate growth or
ownership transition. Financial Services also includes the Corporate Banking Division that originates and services large corporate
relationships, syndicated lending relationships and client derivatives. Community Banking receives an interoffice credit for referral
fees, with the corresponding charge reflected as part of Other, Treasury and Corporate in the accompanying tables. Also captured
within the net intersegment interest income for Financial Services is the NIM for the loans and deposits assigned to the Wealth
Management Division that are housed in the Community Bank.

Other, Treasury and Corporate

Other, Treasury and Corporate is the combination of the Other
segment that represents operating entities that do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for disclosure; BB&T’s
Treasury function, which is responsible for the management of the securities portfolios, overall balance sheet funding and liquidity,
and overall management of interest rate risk; the corporate support functions that have not been allocated to the business segments;
merger-related charges or credits that are incurred as part of the acquisition and conversion of acquired entities; nonrecurring
charges that are considered to be unusual in nature or infrequent and not reflective of the normal operations of the segments;
and intercompany eliminations including intersegment net referral fees and net intersegment interest income (expense).

The loan portfolio acquired in the Colonial acquisition is managed
outside of the Community Banking segment. The assets and related interest income from this loan portfolio have an expected finite
business life and are therefore included in the Other, Treasury and Corporate segment. The investment balances and results
related to affordable housing investments are also included in this segment. Performance results of bank acquisitions prior to
system conversion are typically reported in this segment and on a post-conversion date are reported in the Community Banking segment.

Segment Asset Transfer

During January 2014, approximately $8.3 billion of home equity loans
and lines were transferred from Community Banking to Residential Mortgage Banking based on a change in how these loans are managed
as a result of qualified mortgage regulations. The following tables have been retrospectively adjusted for the loan transfer.

Segment Realignment

During the first quarter of 2016, the asset-based lending group
within the Specialized Lending segment was moved to Community Banking, and the supply-chain lending responsibility was moved from
the Specialized Lending segment to the Financial Services segment. The following tables present segment results prior to the realignment
and subsequent to the realignment.
