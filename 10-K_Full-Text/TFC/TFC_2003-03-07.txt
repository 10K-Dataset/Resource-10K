Forward-Looking
Statements

This report contains
forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of BB&T. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the management of

Merger
Strategy

BB&T’s growth in
business, profitability and market share over the past several years has been enhanced significantly by mergers and acquisitions. BB&T’s acquisition strategy is focused on three primary objectives:

·

to pursue acquisitions of banks and thrifts in the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, Washington D.C., Georgia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and Florida,
generally with assets in the $250 million to $10 billion range,

·

to acquire companies in niche markets that provide products or services that can be offered through the existing distribution system to BB&T’s current
customer base, and

·

to consider strategic acquisitions in new markets that are economically feasible and provide positive long-term benefits.

BB&T has consummated acquisitions of 56 community banks
and thrifts, 60 insurance agencies and 21 non-bank financial services providers over the last fifteen years. BB&T expects, in the long-term, to continue to take advantage of the consolidation in the financial services industry and expand and
enhance its franchise through mergers and acquisitions. The consideration paid for these acquisitions may be in the form of cash, debt or BB&T stock. The amount of consideration paid to complete these transactions may be in excess of the book
value of the underlying net assets acquired, which could have a dilutive effect on BB&T’s earnings per share or book value. In addition, acquisitions often result in significant front-end charges against earnings; however, cost savings and
revenue enhancements, especially incident to in-market bank and thrift acquisitions, are also typically anticipated.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive and dramatic change continues to occur. BB&T’s subsidiaries compete
actively with national, regional and local financial services providers, including banks, thrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers, finance companies and insurance companies. Competition among providers of financial products and services
continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The industry continues to rapidly consolidate, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and
local institutions, while strengthening the franchise of acquirers. For additional information concerning markets, BB&T’s competitive position and business strategies, see “Market Area” and “Lending Activities” below.

Market Area

BB&T’s primary market area consists of North and
South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, eastern Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, northern Florida and Washington, D.C. The area’s employment base is diverse and primarily consists of manufacturing, general services, agricultural,
wholesale/retail trade, technology and financial services. BB&T believes its current market area is economically stable and will support consistent growth in assets and deposits in the future. Even so, management intends to continue expanding
and diversifying the BB&T franchise. Management strongly believes that BB&T’s community bank approach to providing client service is a competitive advantage, which strengthens the Corporation’s ability to enter new markets and
effectively provide financial products and services to businesses and individuals in these markets.

Lending Activities

The primary goal of the BB&T lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loans that are fair to the clients and profitable to the Corporation. This
purpose can best be accomplished by building strong, profitable client relationships over time, with BB&T becoming an important contributor to the prosperity and well being of its clients. BB&T’s philosophy of lending is to attempt to
meet the business and consumer credit needs within defined market segments where standards of profitability, client relationships and credit quality can be met. Based on internal analyses, this philosophy has resulted in BB&T’s loan
portfolio consistently outperforming the average of a group of BB&T’s peer banks in terms of asset quality, portfolio yield and rate of growth.


BB&T focuses lending efforts on small to intermediate commercial and industrial loans,
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Typically, fixed-rate conforming residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary mortgage market and adjustable-rate residential mortgages are generally retained in the
portfolio. Servicing rights on mortgage loans sold are typically retained by BB&T. As of December 31, 2002, BB&T’s total residential mortgage servicing portfolio was approximately $34.8 billion. BB&T conducts the majority of its
lending activities in the context of the Corporation’s community bank operating model, with lending decisions made as close to the client as practicable.

The following table summarizes BB&T’s loan portfolio based on the underlying collateral, rather than the primary purpose of the
loan.

Table 3

Composition of Loan and Lease Portfolio

Mortgage Banking

Branch
Bank is a large originator of residential mortgage loans, with originations in 2002 of $14.1 billion. Branch Bank offers various types of fixed- and adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing owner-occupied
properties. Risks associated with the residential lending function include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of substantially all conforming fixed-rate loans, and default risk by the borrower, which is lessened through
underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. Branch Bank also purchases residential mortgage loans from more than 100 correspondent originators. The loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to the same underwriting and risk
management criteria as loans originated internally.

Laureate Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of Branch Bank, provides commercial mortgage banking services that include arranging and servicing permanent commercial mortgage loans for third party investors.

Commercial Lending

BB&T’s commercial lending program is generally
targeted to serve small-to-middle market businesses with sales of $200 million or less. The bank also makes loans to larger corporate customers where requirements of quality, profitability and relationship are met. Commercial lending includes
commercial, financial, agricultural, industrial and real estate loans. Pricing on commercial loans is usually tied to market indexes, such as the prime rate and the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). For the fifth consecutive year,
BB&T received recognition from the U.S. Small Business Administration as one of the top two “small business friendly” banks in the United States. Management believes that commercial lending to small and mid-sized businesses is among
BB&T’s strongest markets.


Construction Lending

Real estate construction loans include construction / permanent loans, which are intended to convert to permanent one-to-four family residential mortgage loans upon completion of the construction and loans to builders and developers
of residential properties. BB&T is also a commercial construction lender. Loans for commercial construction are usually granted to in-market developers, businesses, individuals or real estate investors for the construction of commercial
structures in BB&T’s market area. They are made for purposes including, but not limited to, the construction of industrial facilities, apartments, shopping centers, office buildings, hotels and warehouses. The properties may be constructed
for sale, lease or owner-occupancy.

Consumer Lending

BB&T offers a wide variety of consumer loan products. Various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to qualifying, existing clients and to other creditworthy candidates in BB&T’s market area. Home equity
loans and lines are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that ensure consistency with the Corporation’s policies. Numerous forms of unsecured loans, including revolving credits (e.g. credit cards, checking account overdraft
protection and personal lines of credit) are provided and various installment loan products, such as vehicle loans, are offered.

Leasing

BB&T provides commercial leasing services through BB&T Leasing Corp. (“Leasing”), a subsidiary of Branch Bank. Leasing
provides three primary products: finance or capital leases, true leases (as defined under the Internal Revenue Code) and other operating leases for vehicles, rolling stock and tangible personal property. Leasing also provides lease-related services
for small to medium-sized commercial customers. In addition to the services offered by Leasing, other BB&T subsidiaries provide leases to municipalities and invest in various types of leveraged lease transactions.

The following table presents BB&T’s total loan
portfolio based on the primary purpose of the loan, rather than the underlying collateral:

The following
table reflects the scheduled maturities of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, as well as construction loans:

Table 5

Selected Loan Maturities and Interest Sensitivity (1)

(1)

Balances include unearned income.

(2)

Includes loans due on demand.

Scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due. Determinations of maturities are based upon contract terms. BB&T’s credit policy does not permit automatic renewals of loans. At the
scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the customer must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute a new note with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

The allowance for loan and lease losses is management’s
estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date. The Company determines the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios. This evaluation is inherently subjective
because it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Those estimates may be susceptible to significant change. Increases to the allowance are made by charges to the
provision for loan and lease losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loans or leases deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the
allowance.

The allowance is the accumulation of
various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. All components of the allowance represent estimates performed pursuant to either SFAS  No. 5,

“Accounting for Contingencies,”

or SFAS No. 114,

“Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.”

Management’s estimate of each SFAS No. 5 component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being
estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and industry loan concentrations; seasoning of the loan portfolio; the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from
external bank regulatory examinations. Reserves for commercial loans are determined by applying loss percentages to the portfolio based


on management’s evaluation and “risk grading” of the commercial loan portfolio adjusted to give effect to current economic
trends. Reserves are provided for noncommercial loan categories based on a four-year weighted average of actual loss experience adjusted to give effect to current economic trends, which is applied to the total outstanding loan balance of each loan
category. Specific reserves are typically provided on all impaired commercial loans in excess of a defined threshold that are classified in the Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful risk grades. The specific reserves are determined on a
loan-by-loan basis based on management’s evaluation of BB&T’s exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the value of any underlying collateral. Loans for which specific reserves are provided under SFAS
No. 114 are excluded from the reserves calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 5 to prevent duplicate reserves. BB&T’s objective is to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type, industry concentration, geographic
distribution and borrower concentration in order to manage overall credit risk by minimizing the adverse impact of any single event or combination of related events.

A portion of the Corporation’s allowance for loan and lease losses is not allocated to any specific
category of loans. This unallocated portion of the allowance reflects the elements of imprecision and estimation risk inherent in the calculation of the overall allowance. Due to the subjectivity involved in determining the overall allowance,
including the unallocated portion, the portion of the allowance considered unallocated may fluctuate from period to period based on management’s evaluation of the factors affecting the assumptions used in calculating the allowance, including
historical loss experience, current economic conditions, industry or borrower concentrations and the status of merged institutions. While the unallocated allowance is available to absorb losses in excess of the amounts allocated to specific loan
categories, allocated portions of the allowance are also available to absorb losses in any loan or lease category. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the combined total of the allocated and
unallocated components.

While management uses
the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance or to the reserving methodology may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making
the valuations or, if required by regulators, based upon information at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate
that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.

The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses at the end of each of the past five years. The allowance has been allocated by applying the methodologies described above to the loan portfolios
based on the underlying collateral of the loans. Amounts applicable to years prior to 2002 have been restated for acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests. This allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated on an
approximate basis and is not necessarily indicative of future losses. The entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans and leases.

relevant to BB&T’s allowance for loan and lease losses for the last five years is presented in the following table.

Table 7

Analysis of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

(1)

Loans and leases are net of unearned income and include loans held for sale.

Nonperforming Assets and Classified Assets

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases,
foreclosed real estate and other repossessed collateral. BB&T generally places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest becomes 90 days past due, or earlier if full collection of principal and interest
become doubtful. Loans past due 90 days or more may remain on accrual status if management determines that concern over the collectibility of principal and interest is not significant. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, interest receivable
is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest payments received thereafter are applied as a reduction of the remaining principal balance so long as the ultimate collection of the principal remains in doubt. Loans and leases are
removed from nonaccrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and when the collectibility of principal or interest is no longer doubtful.

Investment Activities

Investment securities represent a sizeable portion of BB&T’s assets. BB&T’s subsidiary banks invest in securities as
allowable under bank regulations. These securities include all obligations of the U.S. Treasury, agencies of the U.S. government, including mortgage-backed securities and certain derivatives, bank eligible


obligations of any state or political subdivision, bank eligible corporate obligations, including commercial paper, negotiable certificates
of deposit, bankers acceptances, mutual funds and limited types of equity securities. BB&T’s bank subsidiaries may also deal in securities subject to the provisions of the GLB Act. Scott & Stringfellow, Inc., BB&T’s
full-service brokerage and investment banking subsidiary, engages in the underwriting, trading and sales of equity and debt securities subject to the risk management policies of the Corporation.

BB&T’s investment activities are governed internally
by a written, board-approved policy. Investment policy is carried out by the Corporation’s Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which meets regularly to review the economic environment, assess current activities for appropriateness and
establish investment strategies. The ALCO also has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in “Market Risk Management”, in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Investment strategies are established by the
ALCO in consideration of the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest rate sensitivity of the Corporation. In general, the investment portfolio is managed in a
manner appropriate to the attainment of the following goals: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to
secure public funds, trust deposits as prescribed by law and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i) and (ii).

The following table provides information regarding the
composition of BB&T’s securities portfolio at the end of each of the past three years. The trading securities reflected in the accompanying table represent positions held primarily by Scott & Stringfellow, Inc.

Table 8

Composition of Securities Portfolio

Sources of Funds

Deposits are the primary source of funds
for lending and investing activities. Scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, loan sales and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances,
other secured borrowings, Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as longer-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources.


Deposits

Deposits are attracted principally from
clients within BB&T’s market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments to individuals and businesses, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money
rate savings, investor deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge
schedules. Interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) the interest rates offered by competitors, (ii) anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) availability of and cost of alternative sources of funding,
and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. Client deposits are attractive sources of liquidity because of their stability and relative cost. Deposits are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship
and provide opportunities to cross-sell other BB&T services.

The following table provides information regarding the scheduled maturities of time deposits that are $100,000 and greater at December 31, 2002.

Borrowed Funds

BB&T’s ability to borrow funds from nondeposit sources provides additional flexibility in meeting the liquidity needs of customers. Short-term borrowed funds include master notes, securities sold under repurchase agreements,
short-term FHLB advances, Federal funds purchased and U.S. Treasury tax and loan depository note accounts. See Note 9. in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional disclosures related to short-term borrowed funds. The
following table summarizes certain pertinent information for the past three years with respect to BB&T’s short-term borrowed funds:

Table 10

Short-Term Borrowed Funds


BB&T also
utilizes longer-term borrowings when management determines that the pricing and maturity options available through these sources create cost-effective options for funding asset growth and satisfying capital needs. BB&T’s long-term
borrowings include capitalized leases, medium-term bank notes, long-term FHLB advances, and other secured borrowings, subordinated debt issued by BB&T Corporation or the subsidiary banks and trust preferred securities. See Note 10. in the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional disclosures related to long-term borrowings.

Employees

At December 31, 2002, BB&T had approximately 22,500 full-time equivalent employees compared to approximately 20,400 full-time
equivalent employees at December 31, 2001.

Properties

BB&T and its significant subsidiaries
occupy headquarters offices that are either owned or operated under long-term leases, and also own free-standing operations centers, with its primary operations and information technology center located in Wilson, North Carolina. BB&T also owns
or leases significant office space used as the Corporation’s headquarters in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At December 31, 2002, BB&T’s subsidiary banks operated 1,122 branch offices in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia,
Maryland, Georgia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Florida, Indiana and Washington, D.C. BB&T also operates numerous insurance agencies and other facilities. Office locations are owned or leased. Management believes that the
premises occupied by BB&T and its subsidiaries are well-located and suitably equipped to serve as financial services facilities. See Note 6. “Premises and Equipment” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this
report for additional disclosures related to BB&T’s properties and other fixed assets.

under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (the “BHCA”) and the examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”). As state-chartered
commercial banks, Branch Bank, BB&T-SC and BB&T-VA (collectively, the “Banks”) are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by state bank regulatory authorities in their respective home states. These authorities include
the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, in the case of Branch Bank, the South Carolina Commissioner of Banking, in the case of BB&T-SC, and the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Financial Institutions, in the case of
BB&T-VA. Each of the State-Chartered Banks is also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). State and Federal law also govern the activities in which the Banks
engage, the investments they make and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect the Banks’ operations.

In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory
agencies, BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to various other laws and regulations, and supervision and examination by other state and federal regulatory agencies. These include the regulation, examination and
supervision of BB&T’s subsidiaries and affiliates engaged in securities underwriting, dealing, brokerage, investment advisory activities and insurance activities.

The earnings of BB&T’s subsidiaries, and therefore the earnings of BB&T, are affected by general
economic conditions, management policies, changes in state and Federal legislation and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to above. The following description summarizes the significant state and Federal laws to which
BB&T and the Banks are subject. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals are described, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”
or the “Act”), signed into law on November 12, 1999, amended a number of Federal banking laws that affect BB&T and its subsidiary banks, and the provisions of the Act that are believed to be of most significance to BB&T are
discussed below. In particular, the GLB Act permits a bank holding company to elect to become a financial holding company. In order to become and maintain its status as a financial holding company, the bank holding company and all of its affiliated
depository institutions must be well-capitalized, well managed, and have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating. BB&T filed an election and on June 14, 2000, became a financial holding company.

Under the BHCA, a financial holding company may not directly
or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. The
BHCA, as amended by the GLB Act, now generally limits the activities of a bank holding company that is a financial holding company to that of banking, managing or controlling banks; performing certain servicing activities for subsidiaries; and
engaging in any activity, or acquiring and retaining the shares of any company engaged in any activity, that is either (1) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with
the Secretary of the Treasury; or (2) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board.
Activities that are “financial in nature” include those activities that the Federal Reserve Board had determined, by order or regulation in effect prior to enactment of the GLB Act, to be so closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The GLB Act covers a broad range of issues, including a repeal of most of the restrictions on affiliations among depository institutions, securities firms and insurance companies. In particular, the GLB Act repeals sections 20 and 32
of the Glass-Stegall Act, thus permitting unrestricted affiliations between banks and securities


firms. The Act also provides that, while the states continue to have the authority to regulate insurance activities, in most instances they
are prohibited from preventing or significantly interfering with the ability of a bank, directly or through an affiliate, to engage in insurance sales, solicitations or cross-marketing activities. A financial holding company, therefore, may engage
in or acquire companies that engage in a broad range of financial services, including securities activities such as underwriting, dealing, brokerage, investment and merchant banking; and insurance underwriting, sales and brokerage activities.
Although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain areas identified in the Act. The
Act directs the Federal bank regulatory agencies to adopt insurance consumer protection regulations that apply to sales practices, solicitations, advertising and disclosures, and such regulations have been adopted and became effective April 1, 2001.

The GLB Act includes a system of functional
regulation under which the Federal Reserve Board is confirmed as the umbrella regulator for bank holding companies, but bank holding company affiliates are to be principally regulated by functional regulators such as the FDIC for state nonmember
bank affiliates, the Securities and Exchange Commission for securities affiliates and state insurance regulators for insurance affiliates. The Act repealed the broad exemption of banks from the definitions of “broker” and
“dealer” for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but identifies a set of specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, in which a bank may engage without being deemed a “broker”, and
a set of activities in which a bank may engage without being deemed a “dealer”. The Act also makes conforming changes in the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The GLB Act
contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and
procedures regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. The Act provides that, except for certain limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties
unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. An institution may not disclose to a non-affiliated third party, other than to a
consumer reporting agency, customer account numbers or other similar account identifiers for marketing purposes. The Act also provides that the states may adopt customer privacy protections that are stricter than those contained in the Act. The Act
also makes a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. The Act also contains requirements for the posting of notices by operators of
automated teller machines regarding fees charged for the use of such machines.

Many of the GLB Act’s provisions, including the customer privacy protection provisions, require the Federal bank regulatory agencies and other regulatory bodies to adopt regulations to implement
those respective provisions, and the required implementing regulations have been adopted by the bank regulatory agencies. Neither the provisions of the GLB Act nor the Act’s implementing regulations, as proposed or adopted, have had a material
impact on BB&T’s or the Banks’ regulatory capital ratios or well capitalized status (as discussed below) or ability to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.

Payment of Dividends

BB&T is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The majority of BB&T’s revenue is from dividends paid to
BB&T by its banking subsidiaries. BB&T’s banking subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends they can pay. In addition, both BB&T and its Subsidiary Banks are subject to various regulatory
restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. Banking regulators have indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only if (1) the
organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs,
asset quality and overall financial condition. BB&T does not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect the ability of the Banks to pay dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Banks declared
$974.5 million in dividends payable to


BB&T. Subject to restrictions imposed by state laws and federal regulations, the Boards of Directors of the Subsidiary Banks could have
declared dividends from their retained earnings up to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2002.

Capital

The
Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to banking organizations they supervise. Additionally, as
noted above under the GLB Act, a bank holding company that elects to become a financial holding company must be well-managed, have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating, and be well-capitalized. Under the risk-based capital
requirements, BB&T and the Banks are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) of 8%. At least half of the
total capital must be composed of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying perpetual preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, less certain intangibles (“Tier 1 capital”). The remainder may consist of certain
subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments, qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the loan loss allowance (“Tier 2 capital” which, together with Tier 1 capital, composes “total capital”). To be considered
well-capitalized under the risk-based capital guidelines, an institution must maintain a total risk-weighted capital ratio of at least 10% and a Tier 1 risk-weighted ratio of 6% or greater. The ratios of Tier 1 capital and total capital to
risk-adjusted assets for BB&T and the Subsidiary Banks as of December 31, 2002, are shown in the following table.

In addition, each of the Federal bank regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations.
Pursuant to these requirements, banking organizations must maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 3% to 5% subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of an organization’s overall safety and
soundness. The leverage ratios of BB&T and the Subsidiary Banks as of December 31, 2002, also are reflected in the following table.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act of 1991
(“FDICIA”), among other things, identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. BB&T
and each of the Banks are classified as “well-capitalized”. FDICIA also requires the bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements
within these five categories, with progressively more severe restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions according to the category in which an institution is placed. Failure to meet capital requirements can also cause an
institution to be directed to raise additional capital. FDICIA also mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness


standards relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and authorizes administrative action
against an institution that fails to meet such standards.

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC each by regulation has adopted risk-based capital standards that explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as
well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks, as important factors to be taken into account by each agency in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The capital guidelines also provide that an institution’s
exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization’s capital adequacy. The agencies also jointly adopted a regulation,
effective January 1, 2002, amending their regulatory capital standards to change the treatment of certain recourse obligations, direct credit subsidies, residual interest and other positions in securitized transactions that expose banking
organizations to credit risk. The regulation amends the agencies’ regulatory capital standards to align more closely the risk-based capital treatment of recourse obligations and direct credit subsidies, to vary the capital requirements for
positions in securitized transactions (and certain other credit exposures) according to their relative risk, and to require capital commensurate with the risks associated with residual interests.

In addition to the “prompt corrective action”
directives, failure to meet capital guidelines can subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the
FDIC, and under certain conditions the appointment of a conservator or receiver.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

The deposits of the Banks are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law. A majority of the deposits of the Banks are subject to the deposit insurance assessments of the Bank Insurance Fund (“BIF”)
of the FDIC. However, a portion of the Banks’ deposits (relating to the acquisitions of various savings associations) are subject to assessments imposed by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (“SAIF”) of the FDIC.

The FDIC equalized the assessment rates for BIF-insured and
SAIF-insured deposits effective January 1, 1998. The assessments imposed on all FDIC deposits for deposit insurance have an effective rate ranging from 0 to 27 basis points per $100 of insured deposits, depending on the institution’s capital
position and other supervisory factors. Legislation was enacted in 1997 requiring both SAIF-insured and BIF-insured deposits to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”). At
December 31, 2002, the FDIC assessed BIF-insured and SAIF-insured deposits an additional 1.70 basis points per $100 of deposits to cover those obligations. At December 31, 2002, BB&T’s assessment is limited to this 1.70 basis points.

Other Safety and Soundness Regulations

There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on
bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by Federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insurance funds in the
event the depository institution is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. For example, under requirements of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a
source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise. In addition, the “cross-guarantee” provisions of Federal law
require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by either the SAIF or the BIF as a result of the insolvency of commonly controlled insured depository institutions or
for any assistance provided by the FDIC to commonly controlled insured depository institutions in danger of failure. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross-guarantee provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interests of the SAIF or
the BIF or both. The FDIC’s claim for reimbursement under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured
creditors and nonaffiliated holders of subordinated debt of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions.


State banking
regulators and the OCC also have broad enforcement powers over the Banks, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a conservator (with the approval of the Governor in the case of a North Carolina
state bank) in order to conserve the assets of any such institution for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. The North Carolina Commissioner of Banks also has the authority to take possession of a North Carolina state bank in certain
circumstances, including, among other things, when it appears that such bank has violated its charter or any applicable laws, is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact its
business or has an impairment of its capital stock.

Interstate Banking and Branching

Current Federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation. Effective June 1, 1998, a bank headquartered in one state was authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in
another state, as long as neither of the states had opted out of such interstate merger authority prior to such date, and subject to any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time,
not to exceed five years; and certain deposit market-share limitations. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state
where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable Federal or state law.

International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001

On October 26, 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 was signed into law. This act contains the International
Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “IMLAFA”). The IMLAFA contains anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. The
IMLAFA requires U.S. financial institutions to adopt new policies and procedures to combat money laundering and grants the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial
institutions’ operations. BB&T does not expect that compliance with the IMLAFA will have a material impact on BB&T’s or the Banks’ results of operations or financial condition.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) was signed into law. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is applicable to all
companies with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes: (i) new requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise, and responsibilities;
(ii) additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) new standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting
obligations for the reporting company and their directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violation of the securities laws. Many of the provisions became effective immediately while other
provisions become effective over a period of 30 to 270 days and are subject to rulemaking by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although BB&T anticipates that it will incur additional expense in complying with the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the resulting regulations, BB&T does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on BB&T’s or the Banks’ results of operations or financial condition.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of BB&T
Corporation and subsidiaries (“BB&T” or the “Corporation”) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, and related financial information, are presented in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of BB&T’s 2002 performance.

Reclassifications

In certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the 2002 presentation.

Mergers and Acquisitions Completed during 2002

During 2002, BB&T completed the following mergers and acquisitions, all of which were accounted for as purchases as required by
current accounting regulations.

On January 1,
2002, BB&T completed its acquisition of Cooney, Rickard & Curtin, Inc. (“CRC”), the largest independently owned wholesale insurance broker in the nation based in Birmingham, Alabama. In connection with the transaction, BB&T

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information regarding mergers and acquisitions.


Pending Mergers and
Acquisitions

On September 27, 2002,
BB&T announced plans to acquire Equitable Bank (“Equitable”), based in Wheaton, Maryland. At the time of the announcement, Equitable had $477 million in assets and operated five full-service banking offices in Montgomery and Prince
George’s counties. Shareholders of Equitable will receive one share of BB&T common stock in exchange for each share of Equitable. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2003. BB&T expects to issue $1.4
million shares of common stock to consummate the transaction.

On December 4, 2002, BB&T announced plans to acquire Southeastern Fidelity Corporation (“SEFCO”), an insurance premium finance company based in Tallahassee, Florida. Pending regulatory approval, the transaction is
planned to be completed in the first quarter of 2003.

On January 21, 2003, BB&T announced plans to acquire First Virginia Banks, Inc. (“First Virginia”), a bank holding company headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia. First Virginia was the parent company to eight
community banks and operated 364 branches in Virginia, Maryland, and northeast Tennessee at the time of the announcement. At December 31, 2002, First Virginia had $11.2 billion in assets, including $6.4 billion in loans and $4.0 billion in
investment securities, and $9.2 billion of deposits. Shareholders of First Virginia will receive 1.26 BB&T shares in exchange for each share of First Virginia. The merger, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, is expected
to be completed in the second quarter of 2003. BB&T expects to issue $89.3 million shares of common stock to consummate the transaction.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. BB&T’s financial position and results of operations are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, including estimates,
assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes
in BB&T’s consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations. The more critical accounting and reporting policies include BB&T’s accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses, valuation of mortgage
servicing rights, mergers and acquisitions, and income taxes. BB&T’s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding BB&T’s consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, BB&T’s
significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.

The following is a summary of BB&T’s significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and
judgments.

The allowance for loan and lease
losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is based on management’s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in
the nature and volume of loan activity. Estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan administration, the opinions of our regulators, changes in
the size, composition and risk assessment of the loan portfolio. Also included in management’s estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events, the outcome of which is uncertain. These events may
include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in overall interest rates, political conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in
which BB&T conducts business.

BB&T has a
significant mortgage loan-servicing portfolio and has capitalized the associated servicing rights. Mortgage servicing rights represent the present value of the future servicing fees from the right to service loans in the portfolio. The most critical
accounting policy associated with mortgage servicing is the methodology used to determine the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights, which requires the development of a number of estimates, including anticipated loan principal
amortization and prepayments of principal. The value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights is significantly affected by interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of
declining interest rates, the


value of mortgage servicing assets declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage refinance activity. Conversely,
during periods of rising interest rates, the value of servicing assets generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. BB&T amortizes mortgage servicing rights over the estimated period that servicing income is expected to be received
based on projections of the amount and timing of future cash flows. The amount and timing of servicing asset amortization is adjusted periodically based on actual results and updated projections. Please refer to Note 8 in the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management’s assumptions would have on the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights.

BB&T’s growth in business, profitability and market
share over the past several years has been enhanced significantly by mergers and acquisitions. Prior to 2002, BB&T’s acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling-of-interests and purchase business combination methods of accounting.
Effective July 1, 2001, BB&T adopted SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” which allows only the use of the purchase method of accounting. For purchase acquisitions, BB&T is required to record the assets acquired, including
identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed at their fair value, which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other
valuation techniques. The determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets. These estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances
based on planned facilities dispositions and employee severance considerations, among other acquisition-related items. In addition, purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on
the fair value of net assets acquired compared to the carrying value of goodwill.

The calculation of BB&T’s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination. As part of the Company’s overall business strategy,
management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration. This analysis includes evaluating the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits. Management
closely monitors tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company’s overall tax position.

BB&T offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees. The calculation of obligations and related expenses
under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. Actuarial valuations and the determination of future market values of plan assets are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different
assumptions are used. Please refer to Note 13 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for disclosures related to BB&T’s benefit plans, including quantitative disclosures reflecting the impact that changes in certain
assumptions would have on service and interest costs and benefit obligations.

Analysis of Financial Condition

For the year ended December 31, 2002, BB&T’s average assets totaled $75.8 billion, an increase of $7.0 billion, or 10.1%, compared to the 2001 average of $68.8 billion. The major balance sheet categories with increases
in average balances were loans and leases, up $4.3 billion, or 9.2%, and securities, which increased $1.1 billion, or 6.6%. The primary components of growth in average loans and leases were commercial loans and leases, which increased $2.7
billion, or 10.7%; mortgage loans, which increased $325.1 million, or 3.5%; revolving credit loans, which increased $97.7 million, or 11.0%; and consumer loans, which increased $1.1 billion, or 10.1%. Total earning assets averaged $68.2 billion in
2002, an increase of $5.3 billion, or 8.5%, compared to 2001.

BB&T’s average deposits totaled $49.1 billion, reflecting growth of $4.9 billion, or 11.0%, compared to 2001. The categories of deposits with the highest growth rates were: money rate savings, which increased $2.3 billion,
or 18.6%, noninterest-bearing deposits, which increased $995.4 million, or 16.0%, and certificates of deposit and other time deposits, which increased $1.6 billion, or 7.0%.

Short-term borrowed fund include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master
notes, short-term bank notes and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. Average short-term borrowed funds totaled $5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $870.6 million, or 13.9%, from the 2001 average. BB&T
has also utilized long-term debt based on the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of


the alternatives available. Long-term debt includes FHLB advances, other secured borrowings by subsidiary banks and subordinated debt issued
by the Corporation and Branch Bank. Average long-term debt totaled $12.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, up $1.1 billion, or 10.0%, compared to 2001.

The compound annual rate of growth in average total assets for the five-year period ended December 31, 2002,
was 10.6%. Over the same five-year period, average loans and leases increased at a compound annual rate of 10.7%, average securities increased at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, and average deposits grew at a compound annual rate of 7.9%. All
balance sheet growth rates referred to include the effect of acquisitions accounted for as purchases, as well as internal growth.

Securities

The securities portfolios provide earnings and liquidity, as well as an effective tool in managing interest rate risk. Management has
historically emphasized investments with a duration of five years or less to provide greater flexibility in managing the balance sheet in changing interest rate environments. U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency obligations, excluding
mortgage-backed securities, comprised 65.2% of the portfolio at December 31, 2002. The combined duration of the U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency portfolios was 1.61 years at December 31, 2002. Mortgage-backed securities composed 21.7%
of the total investment portfolio at year-end 2002. The effective duration of the mortgage-backed securities was 1.46 years at December 31, 2002. Total securities increased 6.2% in 2002, to a total of $17.8 billion at the end of the year. The
duration of the total portfolio at December 31, 2002 was 1.74 years.

BB&T’s full-service brokerage subsidiary holds trading securities as a normal part of its operations. At December 31, 2002, trading securities reflected on BB&T’s consolidated balance sheet totaled $148.5
million. Market valuation gains and losses in the trading portfolio are reflected in current earnings.

Securities held to maturity are composed of investments in U.S. Treasury securities and made up less than 1% of the total portfolio at
December 31, 2002. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost and totaled $55.5 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $40.5 million outstanding at the end of 2001. During 2001, substantially all the securities in the
held-to-maturity portfolio were transferred to the available-for-sale portfolio in connection with the implementation of SFAS No. 133. This was done to provide greater flexibility in the management of the overall securities portfolio. Unrealized
market valuation gains and losses on securities in the Corporation’s held-to-maturity category affect neither earnings nor shareholders’ equity.

Securities available for sale totaled $17.6 billion at year-end 2002 and are carried at estimated fair value. Securities available for
sale at year-end 2001 totaled $16.6 billion. Unrealized market valuation gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, net of deferred income taxes. The
available-for-sale portfolio is primarily composed of investments in U.S. Treasury securities, government agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities. This portfolio also contains investments in obligations of states and municipalities, which
composed 5.2% of the available-for-sale portfolio, and equity and other securities, which comprised 7.1% of the available-for-sale portfolio.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, BB&T sold $2.6 billion of available-for-sale securities and realized net gains totaling
$170.1 million. The majority of these gains were taken to economically offset increases in the valuation allowance necessary to reduce the carrying value of BB&T’s capitalized mortgage servicing rights.

During the first quarter of 2001, BB&T sold its ownership
interest in an electronic transaction processing company to Concord EFS, Inc. (“Concord”), exchanging nonmarketable equity securities for unregistered Concord common stock. The Concord common shares were subsequently registered by Concord,
and BB&T sold its holdings of Concord, which were included in securities available for sale. As a result of the transaction, BB&T recognized gains of $82.4 million that are reflected in securities gains (losses), net, in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

During the second and
third quarters of 2000, BB&T restructured the available-for-sale securities portfolio. The restructuring was undertaken to improve the overall yield and liquidity of the portfolio, and reduce the overall duration of the portfolio. BB&T sold
$5.9 billion of U.S. Treasuries, obligations of U.S. government agencies and mortgage-backed securities, and incurred approximately $222 million in pretax losses as a result of these sales. The proceeds from these sales were reinvested in higher
yielding securities, primarily obligations of U.S. government agencies.


The following
table presents BB&T’s securities portfolio at December 31, 2002, segregated by major category with ranges of maturities and average yields disclosed.

Table 12

Securities

(1)

Included in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency obligations are mortgage-backed securities totaling $3.9 billion classified as available for sale and carried at
fair value. These securities are included in each of the maturity categories based upon final stated maturity dates. The original contractual lives of these securities range from five to 30 years; however, a more realistic average maturity would be
substantially shorter because of the monthly return of principal on certain securities.

(2)

Securities with no stated maturity includes equity investments which totalled $1.1 billion and trading securities which totalled $148.5 million.

(3)

Yields on tax-exempt securities are calculated on a taxable-equivalent basis.

(4)

Includes securities held to maturity of $55.5 million carried at amortized cost and securities available for sale and trading securities carried at estimated fair
values of $17.6 billion and $148.5 million, respectively.

The available-for-sale portfolio composed 98.9% of total securities at December 31, 2002. Management believes that the high concentration of securities in the available-for-sale portfolio allows greater flexibility in the
day-to-day management of the overall investment portfolio.

The market value of the available-for-sale portfolio at year-end 2002 was $536.1 million greater than the amortized cost of these securities. At December 31, 2002, BB&T’s available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized
appreciation, net of deferred income taxes, of $329.1 million, which is reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. At December 31, 2001, the available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized appreciation of $288.1 million, net of
deferred income taxes.


The fully
taxable equivalent (“FTE”) yield on the total securities portfolio was 6.22% for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to 7.06% for the prior year. The decrease in FTE yield was caused by the lower interest rate environment, which
resulted in cash flows from the payments, prepayments, sales, calls and maturities of higher yielding securities being reinvested at lower interest rates during 2002. The yield on U.S. Treasury and government agency obligations decreased from
7.09% in 2001 to 6.12% in 2002, while the yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased from 6.97% to 6.49% and the FTE yield on state and municipal securities increased from 7.37% last year to 7.47% in the current year.

Loans and Leases

BB&T’s loan growth was negatively affected by the
continued weakness in general economic conditions during 2002. End of period loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $5.6 billion, or 12.3%, as compared to 2001. Average total loans and leases for 2002 increased $4.3 billion, or 9.2%,
compared to 2001.

BB&T is a full-service
lender with approximately one-half of its loan portfolio composed of business loans and one-half composed of loans to individual consumers. BB&T’s management emphasizes loans to small business, commercial middle market, direct retail and
residential mortgage borrowers. Average commercial loans, including lease receivables, increased $2.7 billion, or 10.7%, in 2002 as compared to 2001, and now compose 55.0% of the loan portfolio, compared to 54.0% in 2001. Average consumer loans,
which include sales finance, revolving credit and direct retail, increased $1.2 billion, or 10.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the same period in 2001, and compose 26.1% of average loans, compared to 25.8% in 2001. Average
mortgage loans increased $325.1 million, or 3.5%, in 2002 as compared to 2001, and represented the remaining 18.9% of average total loans for 2002, compared to 20.2% a year ago. BB&T is a large originator of residential mortgage loans, with 2002
originations of $14.1 billion. To improve the overall yield of the loan portfolio and to mitigate interest rate risk, BB&T sells most of its fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market or securitizes the loans and transfers them to the
securities portfolio. At December 31, 2002, BB&T was servicing $34.8 billion in residential mortgages. The mix of the consolidated loan portfolio in 2002 was very similar to that of one year ago.

The growth rates of average loans in the current year were
affected by loan portfolios held by companies that were acquired during 2002. Also, the securitization of $377.4 million in loans during 2001 affected the reported growth in average mortgage loans. During 2002, loans totaling $1.2 billion, $1.9
billion and $1.2 billion were acquired through the purchases of Regional, AREA and MidAmerica, respectively. Excluding the effect of these purchase accounting transactions and the mortgage loan securitizations, average “internal” loan
growth for the year ended December 31, 2002, was 2.0% compared to 2001. Excluding the effects of purchase accounting transactions and loan securitizations, average mortgage loans, including loans held for sale, decreased 3.6%, commercial loans and
leases grew 3.1%, and consumer loans increased 4.5% in 2002 as compared to 2001.

The average annualized fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) yields on commercial, consumer and mortgage loans for 2002 were 6.17%, 8.49% and 6.97%, respectively, resulting in a yield for the
total loan portfolio of 6.93%, compared to 8.37% for the total portfolio in 2001. The 144 basis point decrease in the average yield on loans resulted from a lower average prime rate during late 2001 and throughout 2002, which was the product of
continued aggressive actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board to stimulate the economy. During 2001, the Federal Reserve reduced the target Federal Funds Rate from 6.50% to 1.75%. During 2002, the Federal Reserve further reduced the intended
Federal Funds Rate to 1.25% late in the year. As a result of the Federal Reserve Board’s actions, the average prime rate, which is the basis for pricing many commerical and consumer loans, averaged 4.68% in 2002, compared to 6.92% for 2001.

Asset Quality

While the slowdown in the economy has resulted in higher
levels of nonperforming assets and net charge-offs, BB&T’s lending strategy, which focuses on relationship-based lending within our markets and smaller individual loan balances, continues to produce strong credit quality. BB&T’s
asset quality, as measured by relative levels of nonperforming assets and net charge-offs, has remained approximately one-half that of published industry averages.

Nonperforming assets, which are composed of foreclosed real estate, repossessions, nonaccrual loans and
leases and restructured loans, totaled $451.7 million at December 31, 2002, as compared to $373.6 million at


year-end 2001, an increase of 20.9%. As a percentage of total assets, nonperforming assets were .56% at December 31, 2002, compared to .53%
at the end of 2001. As a percentage of loans and leases plus foreclosed property, nonperforming assets totaled .84% at December 31, 2002, compared to .79% at the end of 2001. The allowance for loan and lease losses, as a percentage of loans and
leases, was 1.35% at December 31, 2002, compared to 1.36% at year-end 2001. Excluding loans held for sale, the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was 1.42% at both December 31, 2002 and 2001. Loans 90 days or
more past due and still accruing interest increased to $115.0 million at year-end 2002 compared to $101.8 million at December 31, 2001. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases increased to .48% for the year ended December 31,
2002, from .40% in 2001. As a result of the increase in net charge-offs, the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to net charge-offs decreased from a multiple of 3.44 at the end of 2001 to a multiple of 2.94 as of December 31, 2002.

The following table summarizes asset quality
information for BB&T for the past five years.

Table 13

Asset Quality

NOTE:   (1)

Includes $144.8 million, $130.7 million, $73.4 million, $68.4 million and $77.5 million of impaired loans at December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. See Note 4 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

(2)

Items referring to loans and leases are net of unearned income and include loans held for sale.

(3)

Excludes net charge-offs and average loans from BB&T’s sub-prime indirect automobile lending operations, insurance premium finance business and direct
consumer finance operations.

Allowance for Loan
and Lease Losses

BB&T’s allowance
for loan and lease losses totaled $723.7 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $644.4 million at the end of 2001, an increase of 12.3%. As a percentage of loans and leases outstanding, the allowance decreased slightly from 1.36% at December
31, 2001, to 1.35% at the end of 2002. Excluding loans held for sale, the percentage was 1.42% at both period ends. The relatively steady ratio of the allowance as a percentage of loans and leases was a result of continued strong asset quality,
including relatively stable levels of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets.


There were no
significant changes in the estimation methods or fundamental assumptions used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2002 compared to 2001. See “Asset Quality” for disclosures regarding changes in the trends of
credit quality.

Please refer to “Allowance
for Loan and Lease Losses” in the “Description of Business” section, which describes BB&T’s allowance policy and methodologies and provides disclosures with respect to allowance allocations.

Deposits and Other Borrowings

Client deposits generated through the BB&T branch network
are the largest source of funds used to support asset growth. While core deposits are BB&T’s primary source of funding, growth rates of core deposits have generally not kept pace with asset growth and, therefore, nondeposit funding sources
have increasingly been used to support balance sheet growth.

Total deposits at December 31, 2002, were $51.3 billion, an increase of $6.5 billion, or 14.6%, compared to year-end 2001. The increase in deposits was driven by a $3.3 billion, or 23.6% increase in money rate savings accounts, a
$924.7 million, or 13.3% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, and a $2.3 billion, or 10.9% increase in certificates of deposits and other time deposits. For the year ended December 31, 2002, total deposits averaged $49.1 billion, an increase of
$4.9 billion, or 11.0%, compared to 2001. The increase was the result of a $2.3 billion, or 18.6%, increase in average money rate savings, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 7%, in other time deposits, and a $995.4 million, or 16.0%, increase in
noninterest-bearing deposits. During the same time periods, average savings and interest checking accounts remained flat at $3.4 billion. Other time deposits, including individual retirement accounts and certificates of deposit, remain
BB&T’s largest category of deposits, comprising 48.3% of average total deposits for the year.

The average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased to 2.39% during 2002, from 4.12% in 2001. The declining interest rate in
2002 was caused by the general slowdown in economic activity and aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates. The average rate paid on other time deposits, including individual retirement accounts and certificates of
deposit, decreased to 3.42% in the current year from 5.45% in 2001. The average cost of money rate savings accounts decreased to 1.13% in the current year from 2.48% in 2001; interest checking decreased from 1.47% in 2001 to .67% in the current
year; and the average cost of savings deposits decreased to .80% in 2002 from 1.42% in 2001.

During 2000, BB&T contracted with an independent third party for the disbursement of official checks. Under the terms of the agreement, BB&T acts as an agent for the third party in the issuance
of official checks. Funds received from the buyers of official checks are transferred to the third party issuer to cover the checks when they are ultimately presented for payment. But for this arrangement with the third party, these funds would have
remained at BB&T in the form of noninterest-bearing deposits. The official check program is contractually arranged to substantially limit BB&T’s exposure to loss, as the third party is required to invest the funds received and maintain
a 1:1 relationship between outstanding checks and the balances available to cover the checks. BB&T monitors this relationship through a reconciliation process. The third party provided a letter of credit from another bank in favor of BB&T
and has access to a revolving line of credit to further mitigate any risk that there would be inadequate funds to cover the outstanding balance of official checks sold. However, in the event that the third party failed to honor official checks
BB&T had sold as its agent, it is likely that BB&T would choose to reimburse the purchasers, though not contractually obligated to do so. At December 31, 2002, the third party issuer had outstanding official checks that had been sold by
BB&T totaling $580.1 million.


BB&T also
uses various types of short-term borrowed funds to supplement deposits in order to fulfill funding needs. See Note 9. “Short-Term Borrowed Funds” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for further disclosure.
The types of short-term borrowings utilized by the Corporation include Federal funds purchased, which composed 29.6% of total short-term borrowed funds, and securities sold under repurchase agreements, which comprised 46.5% of short-term borrowed
funds at year-end 2002. Master notes, U.S. Treasury tax and loan deposit notes, short-term bank notes and short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances are also utilized to meet short-term funding needs. Average short-term borrowed
funds totaled $5.4 billion during 2002, a decrease of $870.6 million, or 13.9%, from 2001, while short-term borrowed funds at year-end 2002 were $5.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 18.8%, compared to year-end 2001. The rates paid on average
short-term borrowed funds decreased from 3.80% in 2001 to 1.78% during 2002. The decrease in the cost of short-term borrowed funds resulted from the lower interest rate environment during 2002, including a 222 basis point decrease in the average
Federal funds rate for 2002 compared to 2001.

BB&T also utilizes long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. See Note 10. “Long-Term Debt” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for further
disclosure. Long-term debt at December 31, 2002 totaled $13.6 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 15.9%, from year-end 2001. The substantial increase in long-term borrowing during 2002 reflects BB&T’s efforts to take advantage of
historically low interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2002, average long-term debt increased $1.1 billion, or 10.0%, compared to the average for 2001. BB&T’s long-term debt consists primarily of FHLB advances to the
Subsidiary Banks, which composed 70.5% of total outstanding long-term debt at December 31, 2002, and subordinated notes, which composed 17.3% of the year-end balance. FHLB advances are cost-effective long-term funding sources that provide BB&T
with the flexibility to structure the debt in a manner that aids in the management of interest rate risk and liquidity. The remaining long-term debt consists of secured borrowings by Branch Bank, redeemable capital securities issued by the
Corporation, mortgage indebtedness and capital leases. The average rate paid on long-term debt decreased from 5.53% during 2001 to 4.84% during 2002 because of the overall declining interest rate environment previously discussed.

Liquidity needs are a primary consideration in evaluating
funding sources. BB&T’s strategy is to maintain funding flexibility, in order that the Corporation may react rapidly to opportunities that may become available in the marketplace. BB&T will continue to focus on traditional core funding
strategies, supplemented by short-term and long-term borrowings. See “Liquidity, Inflation and Changing Interest Rates” for additional discussion.

Analysis of Results of Operations

Consolidated net income for 2002 totaled $1.3 billion, which generated basic earnings per share of $2.75 and diluted earnings per share of
$2.72. Net income for 2001 was $973.6 million and net income for 2000 totaled $698.5 million. Basic earnings per share were $2.15 in 2001 and $1.55 in 2000, while diluted earnings per share were $2.12 and $1.53 for 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Two important and commonly used measures of bank
profitability are return on average assets (net income as a percentage of average total assets) and return on average shareholders’ equity (net income as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity). BB&T’s returns on
average assets were 1.72%, 1.41% and 1.13% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The returns on average common shareholders’ equity were 18.32%, 16.78% and 14.22% for the last three years.

Mergers and acquisitions have played an important role in the
development of BB&T’s franchise. BB&T has been an active acquirer of financial institutions, insurance agencies and other nonbank fee income producing businesses. Refer to Note 2. in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for a summary of mergers and acquisitions consummated during the three years ended December 31, 2002. As a result of this activity, the consolidated results of operations for the three year period covered by this discussion include
the effects of merger-related and restructuring charges, expenses and certain gains related to the consummation of the transactions.

Merger-related charges and expenses include personnel-related items such as staff relocation costs, severance benefits, early retirement
packages and contract settlements. They also include furniture, equipment and occupancy costs related to department and branch consolidations as well as costs related to converting the


data processing systems of the acquired companies to BB&T’s automation platform. Merger-related charges also include professional
fees, advertising and asset write-offs incurred in connection with the mergers.

Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges

During 2002, BB&T recorded merger-related and restructuring charges of $39.3 million, which are reflected in BB&T’s Consolidated Statements of Income as noninterest expenses. These
expenses were recorded in connection with the first quarter systems conversion of F&M National Corporation, the second quarter systems conversion of Community First Banking Company, and the mergers with MidAmerica, AREA, and Regional.

During 2001, BB&T recorded merger-related
and restructuring charges of $199.0 million, which are reflected in BB&T’s Consolidated Statements of Income as noninterest expenses. In addition, $36.4 million was recorded as a provision for loan and lease losses in connection with the
mergers with FCNB Corporation, Century South Banks, Inc., and F&M National Corporation. This provision was recorded to conform the merged entities’ credit policies to those of BB&T, including underwriting and risk rating standards,
charge-offs, past due and nonaccrual loans, as well as to reflect impending changes in the management of problem loans.

During 2000, the Company recorded merger-related and restructuring charges totaling $143.2 million, which are reflected in BB&T’s
Consolidated Statements of Income as noninterest expenses. In addition, $29.9 million of provision for loan and lease losses was recorded associated with BB&T’s mergers with Premier Bancshares, Inc., Hardwick Holding Company, First Banking
Company of Southeast Georgia and One Valley Bancorp, Inc. These provisions were recorded to conform the merged entities’ credit policies to those of BB&T, including underwriting and risk rating standards, charge-offs, past due and
nonaccrual loans, as well as to reflect impending changes in the management of problem loans.

The following table presents the components of merger-related and restructuring charges included in noninterest expenses. This table includes increases to previously recorded merger-related accruals
and period expenses for merger-related items that must be expensed as incurred. Items that are required to be expensed as incurred include certain expenses associated with systems conversions, data processing, training, travel and other costs.

Summary of Merger-Related and Restructuring
Charges

(Dollars in thousands)

Severance and personnel-related costs include severance, employee retention, payments related to change-in-control provisions of employment contracts, outplacement services and other benefits associated with employee termination,
which typically occurs in corporate support and data processing functions. During 2002, BB&T estimated that 372 positions would be eliminated and 370 employees were, in fact, terminated prior to December 31, 2002. Approximately 90 of these
employees will continue to receive severance payments during 2003. During 2001, BB&T estimated that approximately 400 positions would be eliminated and approximately 350 employees were terminated and received severance by the end of 2001. During
2000, BB&T estimated that 450 positions would be eliminated in connection with mergers and approximately 430 employees were terminated and received severance.

Occupancy and equipment charges represent merger-related costs associated with lease terminations, obsolete
equipment write-offs, and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment. Systems conversions and related charges include expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged


companies. Marketing and public relations costs represent direct media advertising relative to the acquisitions and local charitable
contributions that are required by the merger agreements. The other merger-related charges are composed of asset and supply inventory write-offs, which are primarily composed of unreconciled differences in an acquired institution’s accounts or
unreconciled differences identified during systems conversions, litigation accruals, costs to conform an acquired institution’s accounting policies to those of BB&T and other similar charges.

In conjunction with the consummation of an acquisition and the
completion of other requirements, BB&T typically accrues certain merger-related expenses related to estimated severance costs, costs to terminate lease contracts, costs related to the disposal of duplicate facilities and equipment, costs to
terminate data processing contracts and other costs associated with the acquisition. The following tables present a summary of activity with respect to BB&T’s merger and restructuring accruals related to the mergers listed above, with the
more significant mergers (One Valley Bancorp, Inc. and F&M National Corporation) presented separately. These tables include costs reflected as expenses, as presented in the table above, and accruals recorded through purchase accounting
adjustments.

The
remaining accruals at December 31, 2002 for One Valley Bancorp, Inc. and F&M National Corporation are related primarily to costs to exit certain leases and to dispose of excess facilities and equipment. These liabilities will be utilized in the
future upon termination of the various leases and sale of duplicate property. These accruals are expected to be utilized in 2003 unless they relate to specific contracts expiring in later years.

Activity with respect to the merger and restructuring accruals
for all other mergers, which are discussed above, is presented in the accompanying table:

The
liabilities for severance and personnel-related costs relate to severance liabilities that will be paid out based on such factors as expected termination dates, the provisions of employment contracts and the terms of BB&T’s severance plans.
The remaining occupancy and equipment accruals relate to costs to exit certain leases


and to dispose of excess facilities and equipment. This liability will be utilized upon termination of the various leases and sale of
duplicate property. The liabilities associated with systems conversions relate to termination penalties on contracts with information technology service providers. These liabilities will be utilized as the contracts are paid out and expire. The
other merger-related liabilities relate to litigation accruals, accruals to conform the accounting policies of acquired institutions to those of BB&T, and other similar charges.

Because BB&T often has multiple merger integrations in process, and, due to limited resources, must
schedule in advance significant events in the merger conversion and integration process, BB&T’s merger process and utilization of merger accruals may cover an extended period of time. In general, a major portion of accrued costs are
utilized in conjunction with or immediately following the systems conversion, when most of the duplicate positions are eliminated and the terminated employees begin to receive severance. Other accruals are utilized over time based on the sale,
closing or disposal of duplicate facilities or equipment or the expiration of lease contracts. Merger accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. Most of the remaining accruals at December 31, 2002 are expected to be utilized
during 2003, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire in later years.

The accruals utilized during 2002 in the table entitled “All Other Merger Accrual Activity” above include $10.5 million of accrual reversals resulting from revisions to BB&T’s
initial estimates of merger accruals for facilities and personnel-related costs. There were no other material adjustments to merger-related accruals for any of the periods presented.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is BB&T’s primary source of revenue. Net interest income is influenced by a number of factors, including the
volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid thereon. The difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets (with an adjustment made to tax-exempt income to provide comparability
with taxable income, i.e. the “FTE” adjustment) and the cost of the supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin. The accompanying table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense, and
distinguishes between the changes related to increases or decreases in average outstanding balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (volume), and the changes related to increases or decreases in average interest rates on
such assets and liabilities (rate). Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.


Table 14

FTE Net Interest Income and Rate Volume Analysis

For the Years
Ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000

(1)

Yields related to securities based on amortized cost, loans and leases exempt from income taxes are stated on a taxable equivalent basis assuming tax rates in effect
for the periods presented which approximate 39% in total.

(2)

Includes Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements.

(3)

Loan fees, which are not material for any of the periods shown, have been included for rate calculation purposes.

(4)

Nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balances. Only the interest collected on such loans has been included as income.

(5)

Includes assets which were held for sale or available for sale at amortized cost and trading securities at estimated fair value.


For 2002, net interest income on an FTE-adjusted basis totaled $2.9 billion, compared with
$2.6 billion in 2001 and $2.4 billion in 2000. The increase in net interest income during 2002 resulted primarily from a decrease in total interest expense, which was caused by substantially lower interest rates during 2002 as compared to 2001. The
lower average cost of funds resulted in a decrease of $728.4 million in total interest expense. Interest income from loans decreased $377.8 million, and interest income from investment securities decreased $67.7 million.

The FTE-adjusted net interest margin is the primary measure
used in evaluating the effectiveness of the management of earning assets and the liabilities funding those assets. The FTE-adjusted net interest margin was 4.25% in 2002, 4.17% in 2001 and 4.25% in 2000. In addition to changes in the composition of
BB&T’s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the primary reason for the fluctuations in the net interest margin was the rapidly declining interest rate environment prevailing during 2002 and 2001 as the Federal Reserve reduced
short-term interest rates due to a weakening economy. Throughout 2001, the Federal Reserve took aggressive actions to lower the level of interest rates by reducing the benchmark federal funds rate by 475 basis points from 6.50% at the beginning of
the year to 1.75% at year-end where it remained through the first eleven months of 2002. As a result, the prime rate, which is the basis for pricing many commercial and consumer loans, also declined by 475 basis points from 9.50% at the beginning of
2001 to 5.00% at year-end and remained at 4.75% during most of 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Federal Reserve further reduced the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1.25%, which in turn lowered the prime rate to 4.25% at the end
of 2002. Such actions initially contributed to BB&T’s interest sensitive assets repricing more quickly overall than its interest-bearing liabilities during 2001, which resulted in an eight basis points decrease in the FTE-adjusted net
interest margin during 2001 compared to 2000. During 2002, as interest rates stabilized, BB&T’s interest-bearing liabilities also repriced at the lower interest rates, which, together with a shift in the composition of deposits toward lower
cost transaction accounts, resulted in an eight basis points increase in the FTE-adjusted net interest margin during 2002 compared to 2001.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses

A provision for loan and lease losses is charged against earnings in order to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level
that reflects management’s evaluation of the incurred losses inherent in the portfolio. The amount of the provision is based on continuing assessments of nonperforming and “watch list” loans, analytical reviews of loan loss experience
in relation to outstanding loans, loan charge-offs, nonperforming asset trends and management’s judgment with respect to current and expected economic conditions and their impact on the existing loan portfolio

.

The provision for loan and
lease losses recorded by BB&T in 2002 was $263.7 million, compared with $224.3 million in 2001 and $147.2 million in 2000.

The 17.6% increase in the current year provision for loan and lease losses resulted from a combination of factors, including a 31.8%
increase in net charge-offs during the year and growth in the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs were .48% of average loans and leases for 2002 compared to .40% of average loans during 2001. The allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.35% of loans
and leases outstanding and was 1.93x total nonaccrual and restructured loans and leases at year-end 2002, compared to 1.36% and 2.04x, respectively, at December 31, 2001.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, trust revenue, mortgage banking income, investment banking and brokerage
fees, insurance commissions, gains and losses on securities transactions and other commissions and fees derived from bank-related activities.

Noninterest income for 2002 totaled $1.7 billion, compared with $1.4 billion in 2001 and $846.8 million in 2000. The 2002 noninterest
income reflects an increase of $312.1 million, or 22.6%, compared to 2001. Noninterest income for 2001 was $533.6 million, or 63.0%, higher than 2000. The increase in noninterest income for 2002 is primarily the result of substantial growth in
insurance commissions from BB&T’s agency network and gains from sales of securities available for sale as well as increased service charges on deposits, increased mortgage banking income, and higher levels of investment banking and
brokerage fees and commissions. The 2000 results include the effect of the restructuring of the securities portfolio during the second and third quarters of the year (as further discussed in the “Securities” section), which reduced total
noninterest income by $222 million. The major categories of noninterest income and their fluctuations are discussed in the following paragraphs.


Service
charges on deposit accounts represent BB&T’s largest category of noninterest revenue. Such revenues totaled $402.5 million in 2002, an increase of $53.0 million, or 15.2%, compared to 2001. Service charges during 2001 totaled $349.5
million, which represented an increase of $57.0 million, or 19.5% compared to 2000. The primary factors contributing to the 2002 increase were NSF and overdraft charges on personal accounts, which were $34.9 million more than in 2001, and commercial
account analysis fees, which grew $20.9 million. Increases in these same categories composed the bulk of the growth in this category of revenue in 2001 compared to 2000.

Income from mortgage banking activities (which includes revenues from originating, marketing and servicing
mortgage loans and valuation adjustments related to capitalized mortgage servicing rights) totaled $172.8 million in 2002, $148.9 million in 2001 and $104.6 million in 2000. In 2002, mortgage banking income increased $23.9 million, or 16.0%,
compared to 2001. The increase in mortgage banking income in 2002 resulted from substantially higher mortgage loan originations as a result of the continued low interest rate environment, which brought about increases in origination fees,
underwriting fees and servicing fees, which rose $7.8 million, $8.2 million and $24.5 million, respectively, compared to 2001. BB&T originated a record $14.1 billion in mortgage loans in 2002 compared to $10.5 billion in 2001 and $4.7 billion in
2000. Accordingly, gains from the sale of mortgage loans increased by $62.9 million compared to 2001. While lower interest rates in 2002 produced record originations volume, they also led to increased prepayment rates which lowered the value of
existing mortgage servicing rights. As a result, BB&T recorded net impairment charges of $152.4 million during 2002, compared to net impairment charges of $61.6 million in 2001. Mortgage revenues for 2002 included a $14.5 million gain due to a
new accounting requirement to record interest rate lock commitments at fair value with related changes recorded in earnings. In 2001, mortgage banking income increased $44.4 million, or 42.4%, compared to 2000 as a result of factors caused by the
123% increase in mortgage loan origination volume.

BB&T has an extensive insurance agency network, which is the 10

th

largest in the nation.
Commission income from BB&T’s insurance operations totaled $313.4 million in 2002, an increase of $123.0 million, or 64.6%, compared to 2001. Commission income for 2001 totaled $190.4 million, an increase of $28.4 million, or 17.5% compared
to 2000. During 2002 and 2001, BB&T continued to expand its insurance operations through acquisitions of additional agencies in the Company’s market area. These acquisitions, all of which were accounted for as purchases, were responsible
for $96.9 million of the increase in agency insurance commissions during 2002 and $24.6 million in 2001. Including growth from acquired agencies, BB&T’s property and casualty commissions increased $96.4 million. Similar growth in these
product lines also drove the 2001 increase.

Revenue from corporate and personal trust services totaled $94.5 million in 2002, $90.9 million in 2001 and $80.0 million in 2000. The 2002 revenue reflects an increase of $3.6 million, or 3.9% over 2001, which was
$10.9 million, or 13.6%, more than 2000. Managed assets totaled $20.9 billion at the end of 2002 compared to $16.7 billion at December 31, 2001. The revenue increase in 2002 was driven by higher general trust services income and revenues
from the management of estates. The majority of the growth in trust revenue and managed assets in 2002 resulted from the acquisitions of AREA and MidAmerica. Growth in revenues and managed assets have been depressed during the last two years by
declining equity markets. The revenue increase in 2001 was primarily the result of internal growth driven by increased general trust services income and mutual fund management fees.

Net gains on sales of securities totaled $170.1 million in 2002 and $122.1 million in 2001 compared to net
losses of $219.4 million in 2000. Excluding the effect of gains realized during 2002 and 2001 to economically offset increases in the valuation allowance of mortgage servicing rights, the gain realized from the sale of BB&T’s investment in
an electronic transaction processing company in 2001, and losses incurred as a result of the restructuring of the available-for-sale securities portfolio during 2000, all previously discussed in the “Securities” section, net gains on sales
of securities were $13.7 million, $10.8 million, and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions totaled $210.6 million in 2002, $175.3 million in 2001 and $163.5 million in 2000.
The 2002 revenue reflects an increase of $35.3 million, or 20.1% over 2001, which was $11.8 million, or 7.2% greater than 2000. The large increase in 2002 over 2001 was due to higher fixed income securities underwriting fees, retail brokerage fees
and investment banking income at BB&T’s full-service brokerage and investment banking subsidiary, Scott & Stringfellow. The increase in 2001 over 2000 resulted in part from the purchase of Edgar M. Norris & Co., which added $4.8
million in revenues, as well as internal growth in fees and commissions from brokerage and underwriting services.


Other
nondeposit fees and commissions, including bankcard fees and merchant discounts, totaled $208.5 million in 2002, an increase of $21.0 million, or 11.2%, compared with $187.5 million earned in 2001, which represented an increase of $21.0
million, or 12.6%, over the $166.5 million in 2000 revenue. Major sources of the increase in 2002 revenue include bankcard fees and merchant discounts, which increased $6.0 million, or 9.8%, check card interchange fees, which increased $8.4 million,
or 31.7%, and gift card income, which increased $5.1 million. The increase in other nondeposit fees and commissions in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily the result of higher bankcard fees and merchant discounts, increased ATM and point of
sale fees, and income from the official check outsourcing program, which began mid-year 2000.

Other income totaled $120.1 million in 2002, an increase of $4.5 million, or 3.9%, compared with $115.6 million earned in 2001, which represented an increase of $18.6 million, or 19.1%, over the $97.0
million earned in 2000. The primary components of the increase in 2002 were higher income from life insurance, which increased $22.7 million, or 34.5%, and higher income from check sales, which grew by $3.3 million. These increases were partially
offset by a write-down in the value of investments in limited partnerships totaling $11.1 million, a decrease in amortization of negative goodwill in the amount of $4.8 million compared to 2001, and a loss on non-hedging derivatives in the amount of
$5.6 million. The primary component of the increase in 2001 was income from life insurance, which increased $26.2 million, or 66.2%. This increase was partially offset a decrease in amortization of negative goodwill in the amount of $3.7 million, or
34.0%, compared to 2000.

The ability to generate
significant amounts of noninterest revenues in the future will be very important to the continued success of BB&T. Through its subsidiaries, BB&T will continue to focus on asset management, mortgage banking, trust, insurance, investment and
brokerage services, as well as other fee-producing products and services. BB&T plans to continue to pursue acquisitions of additional insurance agencies and asset management companies, as well as explore strategic acquisitions of other nonbank
entities as a means of expanding fee-based revenues. Also, among BB&T’s principal strategies following the acquisition of a financial institution is the cross-sell of noninterest income generating products and services to the acquired
institution’s client base.

The following
table provides a breakdown of BB&T’s noninterest income:

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense totaled $2.4 billion in 2002, $2.2
billion in 2001 and $2.0 billion in 2000. Certain significant items principally stemming from mergers and acquisitions were recorded as charges to noninterest expense during 2002, 2001 and 2000. In 2002, $39.3 million in pretax merger-related
charges were recorded, while 2001 included $199.0 million in merger-related charges and $143.2 million were recognized in 2000. Additional


disclosures related to these merger-related charges are presented above in “Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges.” Total
noninterest expense increased $156.3 million, or 7.0%, from 2001 to 2002 and $228.2 million, or 11.4%, from 2000 to 2001. The 2002 growth rate includes the effects of acquisitions accounted for as purchases during 2002, including Regional, AREA,
MidAmerica, CRC, and several nonbank financial services companies and insurance agencies, which added costs of $67.9 million. Excluding the effects of the timing of such purchase acquisitions, noninterest expense increased by 4.4% compared to 2001.
The growth in 2001 was similarly affected by acquisitions accounted for as purchases during 2001, including Community First Banking Company, Virginia Capital Bancshares, Inc., FirstSpartan Financial Corp., BankFirst Corporation, Edgar M. Norris
& Co., Laureate Capital Corp., and several insurance agencies. The categories of noninterest expense creating these increases are further explained below.

Total personnel expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, totaled $1.3 billion in 2002, an
increase of 15.2%, compared to the $1.1 billion in personnel expense incurred in 2001. The 2001 expense reflected an increase of $111.1 million, or 10.9%, compared to the $1.0 billion recorded in 2000. Total personnel expense includes salaries and
wages, as well as pension and other employee benefit costs. The 2002 increase in personnel expenses was primarily caused by the effect of acquisitions, which accounted for $137.2 million of the increase, as well as higher mortgage loan production
incentive compensation and investment banking incentive compensation, which grew $15.1 million and $14.8 million, respectively. In addition, pension plan expense more than doubled, increasing $15.8 million, or 117%, compared to 2001. The increase in
2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the same factors that caused the 2002 increase.

Net occupancy and equipment expense totaled $341.1 million in 2002, $303.4 million in 2001 and $282.5 million in 2000. The net occupancy and equipment expense for 2002 reflects an increase of $37.7
million, or 12.4% compared to 2001, which was $20.9 million, or 7.4% greater than the expense incurred in 2000. The increase during 2002 was due to higher rent on buildings and premises, information technology equipment expenses, maintenance and
utility expenses and real estate taxes, which increased $11.3 million, $8.3 million, $4.5 million, and $4.0 million, respectively, from 2001. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was generally due to the same factors that caused the 2002 increase.

Amortization expense associated with intangible
assets totaled $20.9 million in 2002, $72.7 million in 2001 and $64.6 million in 2000. The decrease in 2002 is due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

, which ended the amortization of goodwill
effective January 1, 2002. Amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights totaled $100.1 million, $46.0 million and $18.8 million during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These increases were caused by significant growth in the balance of
capitalized mortgage servicing rights as a result of substantially higher mortgage loan originations during 2002 and 2001 as a result of favorable historically low interest rates.

Professional services expenses totaled $73.5 million, an increase of $14.2 million, or 24.0%, compared to the
$59.3 million incurred in 2001. This increase was primarily driven by higher legal expenses and accounting fees. The 2001 professional services expenses reflect a $9.2 million, or 18.4%, increase over 2000. The increase was caused by the same
factors that affected the 2002 increase.

Other
noninterest expense totaled $512.9 million for 2002, an increase of $90.8 million, or 21.5%, compared to 2001, which reflected an increase of $4.1 million, or 1.0% compared to the $426.2 million incurred in 2000. The majority of the 2002 increase
resulted from higher software expenses, deposit related expenses, employee travel, courier and postage expenses. The 2001 increase was caused by increases in the same categories that affected the 2002 expenses.


The following
table presents a breakdown of BB&T’s noninterest expenses for the past three years:

Table 16

Noninterest Expense

Provision for Income
Taxes

BB&T’s provision for income
taxes totaled $497.5 million for 2002, an increase of $110.7 million, or 28.6%, compared to 2001. The provision for income taxes totaled $386.8 million in 2001 and $314.5 million in 2000. BB&T’s effective tax rates for the years ended 2002,
2001 and 2000 were 27.8%, 28.4% and 31.0%, respectively. The decline in the effective rates reflected the elimination of nondeductible goodwill amortization in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002 and the implementation of certain
business and investment strategies that resulted in a reduction in the consolidated income tax provision. The increase in the provisions for both 2002 and 2001 compared to prior years results from higher pretax income, offset in part by lower
effective tax rates.

During the last three
years, BB&T entered into option contracts which legally transferred part of the responsibility for the management of future residuals of certain leveraged lease investments including the future remarketing or re-leasing of these assets to a
wholly-owned subsidiary in a foreign jurisdiction having a lower income tax rate, thereby lowering the effective income tax rate applicable to these lease investments. These option contracts provide that the foreign subsidiary may purchase the lease
investments at expiration of the existing leveraged leases for a fixed price. As a result, a portion of the residual value included in the consolidated leveraged lease analysis should be taxed at a lower tax rate than originally anticipated,
resulting in a change in the total net income from the lease. The net income from the affected leases was recalculated from inception based on the new effective income tax rate. The recalculation had the effect of reducing net interest income for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, by $9.7 million, $40.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively, and reducing the income tax provisions for the last three years by $20.2 million, $56.6 million and $19.8 million, respectively.
BB&T intends to permanently reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary and, therefore, deferred income taxes associated with the foreign subsidiary arising from these transactions have not been provided.

During 2001, Branch Bank transferred certain securities and
real estate secured loans to a subsidiary in exchange for additional common equity in the subsidiary. The transaction resulted in a difference between Branch Bank’s tax basis in the equity investment in the subsidiary and the assets transferred
to the subsidiary. This difference in basis resulted in a net reduction in the provision for income taxes of $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.


The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is conducting an examination of
BB&T’s federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998. In connection with this examination the IRS has issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment with respect to BB&T’s income tax treatment of certain
leveraged lease investments that were entered into during the years under examination. Management believes that BB&T’s treatment of these leveraged leases was appropriate and in compliance with existing tax laws and regulations, and intends
to vigorously defend this position. In addition, inasmuch as the proposed adjustments relate primarily to the timing of taxable revenue recognition and amortization expense, deferred taxes have been provided. Management does not expect that
BB&T’s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations will be materially adversely affected as a result of the IRS examination.

Market Risk Management

The effective management of market risk is essential to achieving BB&T’s strategic financial objectives. As a financial
institution, BB&T’s most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The primary objective of interest rate risk management is to minimize the effect that changes in interest rates have on net interest income. This is
accomplished through active management of asset and liability portfolios with a focus on the strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and management of appropriate maturity mixes of assets and liabilities. The goal of these activities is
the development of appropriate maturity and repricing opportunities in BB&T’s portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce consistent net interest income during periods of changing interest rates. BB&T’s Asset / Liability
Management Committee (“ALCO”) monitors loan, investment and liability portfolios to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk. These portfolios are analyzed for proper fixed-rate and variable-rate mixes under various interest
rate scenarios.

The asset/liability management
process is designed to achieve relatively stable net interest margins and assure liquidity by coordinating the volumes, maturities or repricing opportunities of earning assets, deposits and borrowed funds. It is the responsibility of the ALCO to
determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as ensure an adequate level of liquidity and capital, within the context of corporate performance goals. The ALCO also sets policy
guidelines and establishes long-term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity. The ALCO meets regularly to review BB&T’s interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective market
and business conditions, and adopts funding and balance sheet management strategies that are intended to ensure that the potential impact on earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is within acceptable standards.

BB&T utilizes a variety of financial
instruments to manage various financial risks. These instruments, commonly referred to as derivatives, primarily consist of interest rate swaps, caps, floors, collars, financial forward and futures contracts and options written and purchased. A
derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. BB&T uses derivatives primarily to hedge business loans, forecasted sales of
mortgage loans, federal funds purchased, long-term debt and certificates of deposit. These hedges resulted in an increase in net interest income of $44.8 million and $.9 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and a decrease in net interest income
of $8.1 million in 2000.

Derivative contracts
are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts. Notional amounts only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties and are not a measure of financial risk. On
December 31, 2002, BB&T had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $11.7 billion. The estimated fair value of open contracts used for risk management purposes at December 31, 2002 had net unrealized gains of
$149.5 million.

See Note 18. “Derivative
Financial Instruments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.


Liquidity, Inflation and
Changing Interest Rates

The majority of
BB&T’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and, therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Fluctuations in interest rates and actions
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) to regulate the availability and cost of credit have a greater effect on a financial institution’s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and
services. Through its balance sheet management function, which is monitored by the ALCO, BB&T is positioned to respond to changing needs for liquidity, changes in interest rates and inflationary trends.

BB&T’s interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in
the following table. The table reflects rate-sensitive positions at December 31, 2002, and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates. The carrying amounts of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods
in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap. To reflect anticipated prepayments, certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather
than contractual cash flows. The table does not reflect the impact of hedging strategies.

Projected runoff of deposits that do not have a contractual maturity date was computed based upon decay rate assumptions developed by bank regulators to assist banks
in addressing FDICIA rule 305.

Management uses Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis (“Simulation”) to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation takes into account the current contractual agreements that
BB&T has made with its customers on deposits, borrowings, loans, investments and any commitments to enter into those transactions. Management monitors BB&T’s interest sensitivity by means of a computer model that incorporates current
volumes, average rates earned and paid, and scheduled maturities and payments of asset and liability portfolios, together with multiple scenarios of projected prepayments, repricing opportunities and anticipated volume growth. Using this
information, the model projects earnings based on projected portfolio


balances under multiple interest rate scenarios. This level of detail is needed to simulate the effect that changes in interest rates and
portfolio balances may have on the earnings of BB&T. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but it provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than
other analyses such as static or dynamic gap.

The asset/liability management process requires a number of key assumptions. Management determines the most likely outlook for the economy and interest rates by analyzing external factors, including published economic projections and
data, the effects of likely monetary and fiscal policies as well as any enacted or prospective regulatory changes. BB&T’s current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth, accessibility of funds
for short-term needs and capital maintenance are also considered. This data is combined with various interest rate scenarios to provide management with information necessary to analyze interest sensitivity and to aid in the development of strategies
to reach performance goals.

The following table
shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next twelve months under the “most likely” interest rate scenario incorporated into the Interest Sensitivity Simulation
computer model. Key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets; cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments; changes in market conditions, loan volumes and pricing; deposit
sensitivity; customer preferences; and capital plans. The resulting change in net interest income reflects the level of sensitivity that net interest income has in relation to changing interest rates.

Table 18

Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis

Management has established parameters for asset/liability management, which prescribe a maximum impact on net interest income of 3% for a 150 basis point parallel change in interest rates over six months from the most likely interest
rate scenario, and a maximum of 6% for a 300 basis point change over 12 months. It is management’s ongoing objective to effectively manage the impact of changes in interest rates and minimize the resulting effect on earnings.

Liquidity represents BB&T’s continuing ability to
meet funding needs, primarily deposit withdrawals, timely repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as trading securities and securities available for sale, many
other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity in national money markets, growing core deposits, the repayment of loans and the capability to securitize or
package loans for sale.

Traditional sources of
liquidity also include Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and other short-term borrowed funds, commercial paper, revolving credit and long-term debt at both the corporate and bank level.

BB&T Corporation (“Parent Company”) uses
dividends and returns of investments in its subsidiaries, funds from master note agreements with commercial clients of subsidiary banks and access to the capital markets as its major sources of funding to meet liquidity needs.


The primary
source of funds used for parent company cash requirements has been dividends from the subsidiary banks, which totaled $974.5 million during 2002, and proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes, which totaled $493 million in 2002. Funds raised
through master note agreements with commercial clients also support the short-term cash needs of the parent company and bank as well as nonbank subsidiaries. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, master note balances totaled $721.1 million and $763.7
million, respectively.

The Parent Company has a
$250 million revolving credit agreement with a group of unaffiliated banks, which serves as a backup liquidity facility for the master note program referred to above. This agreement has historically been negotiated annually with the current
agreement scheduled to expire April 4, 2003, with a provision to extend the expiration date under certain circumstances. No borrowings have occurred under this backup facility.

The Parent Company has five issues of subordinated notes outstanding, which collectively totaled $2.0 billion
at December 31, 2002, and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2001. Please refer to Note 10 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information with respect to these subordinated notes.

BB&T’s subsidiary banks have several major sources of
funding to meet their liquidity requirements, including access to capital markets through issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes and institutional certificates of deposit, availability to the FHLB system, dealer repurchase agreements and
repurchase agreements with commercial clients, participation in the Treasury, Tax and Loan and Special Direct Investment programs with the Federal Reserve, availability to the overnight and term Federal funds markets, use of the Cayman branch
facility for access to European deposits, access to retail brokered certificates of deposit and a borrower in custody program with the Federal Reserve for availability to the discount window.

Management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate
to meet BB&T’s current requirements and plans for continued growth. See Note 6 “Premises and Equipment”, Note 10 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for additional information regarding outstanding balances on sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Related Party Transactions

BB&T’s significant off-balance sheet arrangements
include certain investments in low-income housing and historic building rehabilitation projects throughout its market area. BB&T enters into such arrangements as a means of supporting local communities and recognizes tax credits relating to its
investments. At December 31, 2002, BB&T’s investments in such projects totaled $14.2 million. BB&T typically acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the
partnerships. BB&T’s subsidiary banks typically provide financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project.
Outstanding commitments to fund low income housing investments totaled $168.9 million at December 31, 2002. BB&T’s risk exposure relating to such off-balance sheet arrangements is generally limited to the amount of investments and
commitments made. Please refer to Note 1 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of these investments in limited partnerships.

A summary of BB&T’s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date is
presented in Table 19 in the “Liquidity, Inflation and Changing Interest Rates” section herein.

In the normal course of business, BB&T is also a party to financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to mitigate
exposure to interest rate risk. Such financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain contractual agreements, including standby letters of credit and financial guarantee arrangements. Further discussion of these commitments is
included in Note 14 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.

In addition, BB&T enters into derivative contracts to manage various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an
underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet


with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the
balance sheet date. Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts, which only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and are not a measure financial risk. Therefore, the derivative liabilities
recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Notes 1 and 18 in the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements”.

BB&T’s
contractual obligations are summarized in the accompanying table. Other commitments includes commitments to lend. Not all of these commitments will be drawn upon, thus the actual cash requirements are likely to be significantly less than the amounts
reported for “Other Commitments” in the accompanying table.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

Other commitments include unfunded business loan commitments, unfunded overdraft protection on demand deposit accounts and other unfunded commitments to lend.

Related Party Transactions

BB&T has no material related party
transactions. The Corporation may extend credit to certain officers and directors in the ordinary course of business. These loans are made under substantially the same terms as comparable third-party lending arrangements and are in compliance with
applicable banking regulations.

Capital Adequacy and
Resources

The maintenance of appropriate
levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on an ongoing basis. BB&T’s principal goals related to capital are to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base from which to support future
growth and to comply with all regulatory standards.

Shareholders’ equity totaled $7.4 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 20.1%, from year-end 2001. During 2002, BB&T issued 36.6 million shares in connection with acquisitions accounted for as
purchases, the exercise of stock options and other stock-based incentive plans, which increased shareholders’ equity by $1.2 billion. This growth was partially offset by the repurchase of 21.8 million shares of common stock at a cost, including
commissions of $801.2 million. Growth of $763.8 million in shareholders’ equity resulted from BB&T’s earnings retained after dividends to shareholders. Additionally, shareholders’ equity was increased by unrealized gains on
securities available for sale, which increased $41.0 million during 2002, net of deferred income taxes.


Bank holding
companies and their subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to risk-based capital adequacy. Risk-based capital ratios measure capital as a percentage of a combination of risk-weighted balance sheet and off-balance sheet
risk. The risk-weighted values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are determined in accordance with risk factors specified by Federal bank regulatory pronouncements.

Tier 1 capital (common shareholders’ equity, excluding unrealized gains or losses on debt securities
available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges, net of deferred income taxes, plus certain mandatorily redeemable capital securities, less nonqualifying intangible assets) is required to be at least 4% of risk-weighted assets,
and total capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital, a qualifying portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses and qualifying subordinated debt) must be at least 8% of risk-weighted assets, with one half of the minimum consisting of Tier 1 capital.
The Tier 1 capital ratio for BB&T at the end of 2002 was 9.2%, and the total capital ratio was 13.4%. At the end of 2001, these ratios were 9.8% and 13.3%, respectively.

In addition to the risk-based capital measures described above, regulators have also established minimum
leverage capital requirements for banking organizations. This is the primary measure of capital adequacy used by management and is calculated by dividing period-end Tier 1 capital by average tangible assets for the most recent quarter.
BB&T’s Tier 1 leverage ratio at year-end 2002 was 6.9%, compared to 7.2% at year-end 2001. The minimum required Tier 1 leverage ratio ranges from 3% to 5% depending upon Federal bank regulatory agency evaluation of an organization’s
overall safety and soundness. BB&T’s regulatory capital and ratios are set forth in the following table.

Table 20

Capital—Components and Ratios

Segment Results

BB&T’s operations are divided into
six reportable business segments: the Banking Network, Mortgage Banking, Trust Services, Agency Insurance, Investment Banking and Brokerage, and Treasury. These operating segments have been identified based primarily on BB&T’s existing
organizational structure. See Note 20. “Operating Segments”, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein, for a full discussion of the segments, the internal accounting and reporting practices utilized by BB&T
to manage these segments and financial disclosures by segment as required by SFAS No. 131. Fluctuations in noninterest income and expense earned and incurred related to external customers are more fully discussed in the “Noninterest
Income” and “Noninterest Expense” sections of this discussion and analysis. Expenses that are considered to be merger-related or restructuring charges and a gain from the sale of an equity investment in an electronic transaction
processing company during 2001, as previously discussed, are retained in the Corporate Office and are excluded from these segments.

Banking Network

The Banking Network grew internally during 2002 as well as through mergers of three banking companies. The total Banking Network was
composed of 1,122 banking offices at the end of 2002, up from 1,081 banking offices at December 31, 2001. Net interest income for the Banking Network totaled $2.2 billion, an increase of


$167.1 million, or 8.3%, compared to 2001. The 2001 balance represented an increase of $87.6 million, or 4.5%, compared to 2000. The increase
in net interest income in 2002 is composed of a 6.5% increase from external customers and a 12.7% increase in the net credit generated by the internal funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) system. The increase in net intersegment interest income
reflects the addition of FTP adjustments associated with the loan and deposit balances of the institutions acquired during 2002 and strong internal growth in deposits during 2002 resulting in an increase in the credit for funds received through the
FTP system.

The provision for loan and lease
losses increased $1.8 million, or .9%, from 2001 to 2002. This slight increase reflects the relatively stable levels of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets during 2002. The 2001 provision reflected an increase of $65.0 million, or
43.7%, compared to 2000. This increase resulted from added provisions from acquired institutions, and higher provision necessary to cover significant net charge-off growth in 2001 compared to 2000.

Noninterest income produced from external customers through
the Banking Network increased $158.0 million, or 29.0% during 2001 due primarily to growth in service charges on deposits, while noninterest income allocated from other segments increased $106.5 million, or 44.4% due to intersegment revenue
received as a result of substantially higher mortgage loan originations. Comparing 2001 to 2000, noninterest income from external customers increased $88.6 million, or 19.4%, and intersegment noninterest income increased $119.2 million, or
99.0%. Noninterest expenses incurred within the Banking Network increased $38.4 million, or 3.7%, because of increased employee related expenses, while noninterest expenses allocated from the other operating segments increased $74.9 million, or
14.9%, over the same time frame, because of financial institutions acquired during the year and a substantial increase in full time equivalent employees in the Banking Network, upon which certain expense allocations are based. Comparing 2001 to
2000, noninterest expense increased $87.1 million, or 9.2%, and noninterest expenses allocated to the Banking Network from intercompany sources increased $178.9 million, or 55.0%.

The provision for income taxes allocated to the Banking Network increased $63.4 million, or 20.9%, because of
a 30.1% increase in pretax income, which was partially offset by lower effective tax rates, which reflect lower consolidated effective tax rates. Effective tax rates declined from 28.8% in 2001 to 26.8% in 2002 due to the elimination of
nondeductible goodwill amortization in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002 and the implementation of various business strategies, as discussed in the “Provision for Income Taxes” section herein. The 2001 provision for
income taxes decreased $49.9 million, or 14.1%, compared to 2000 because of decreases in pretax income and the effective tax rate.

Total identifiable assets for the Banking Network increased $9.7 billion, or 25.4%, to a total of $47.8 billion, compared to 2001, which
reflected an increase of $577.3 million, or 1.5%, compared to 2000. These increases were largely due to acquisitions.

Mortgage Banking

BB&T’s Mortgage Banking segment further expanded during 2002 compared to 2001 because of the continued favorable low interest
rate environment. BB&T’s mortgage originations totaled $14.1 billion for 2002, up 34.3% compared to 2001. BB&T’s residential mortgage servicing portfolio totaled $34.8 billion at year-end 2002 compared with $29.0 billion in 2001.

Net interest income for the Mortgage Banking
segment totaled $309.3 million, up $150.6 million, or 94.9%, compared to 2001. The 2001 amount reflected an increase of 37.8% compared with 2000. These increases reflect the continued growth in mortgage originations as a result of historically low
interest rates. The continued strong credit quality of the mortgage portfolio has resulted in the Mortgage Banking segment’s provision for loan and lease losses being relatively stable during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000.

Noninterest income produced from external
customers increased $30.9 million, or 24.2% compared to 2001, which in turn reflected an increase of $42.2 million, or 49.5%, from 2000. The increases were the result of record origination volume in 2001 and 2002. Noninterest expenses incurred
within the Mortgage Banking segment increased $78.7 million, or 97.1%, as a result of higher amortization of mortgage servicing rights while noninterest expenses allocated from the other operating segments increased $3.2 million, or 12.0%. The
increase in expenses allocated to the Mortgage Banking segment during 2002 reflects the results of acquired institutions. Comparing 2001 and 2000, noninterest expenses from external sources increased $22.3 million, or 37.9%, and intersegment
noninterest expenses increased $3.4 million, or 14.8%.


The provision
for income taxes allocated to the Mortgage Banking segment increased $22.9 million, or 42.4%, principally due to higher pretax income. For 2001, the provision for income taxes increased $21.9 million, or 68.2%, compared to 2000 due to the same
reasons that caused the 2002 increase.

Total
identifiable assets for the Mortgage Banking segment increased $1.7 billion, or 19.2%, from 2001 to 2002, and $686.4 million, or 8.3%, from 2001 to 2000, due to acquisitions and mortgage origination volumes during the last two years.

Trust Services

Net interest income for the Trust Services segment totaled
$27.5 million, an increase of $15.1 million, or 122.1%, compared to 2001. This increase is composed of a 43.8% decrease in net interest expense paid to external customers and a 1.7% decrease in the net credit for funds as calculated by
BB&T’s internal FTP system. This decrease is due to lower average carrying values of assets under administration compared to 2001, which resulted from the depressed markets. The net interest income in 2001, which totaled $12.4 million, was
$1.4 million, or 10.3% less than the balance for 2000. This decrease is due to lower average carrying values of assets under administration compared to 2000, which resulted from the lower interest rate environment.

Noninterest income produced from external customers increased
$5.7 million, or 6.2% during 2002, while noninterest income for 2001 reflected an increase of $11.9 million, or 14.9%, compared to 2000. Noninterest expenses incurred within the Trust Services segment increased $19.8 million, or 33.0%, while
noninterest expenses allocated from the other operating segments increased $5.4 million. For 2001, noninterest expense increased $8.1 million, or 15.6%, while expenses allocated to the Trust Services segment decreased $.6 million, or 15.1%.

The provision for income taxes allocated to
Trust Services decreased $1.0 million, or 9.1%, primarily due to lower pretax income. Comparing 2001 and 2000, the provision for income taxes increased $.9 million, or 8.7%. Total identifiable segment assets for Trust Services increased 25.4% to a
total of $78.7 million at December 31, 2002 compared to 2001, and increased 58.8% from 2000 to 2001 primarily due to acquisitions of financial institutions during 2002 and 2001.

Agency Insurance

Noninterest income produced from external sources increased $118.7 million, or 69.8% during 2002 primarily
due to the acquisitions of CRC and eight other insurance agencies during the year along with internally-generated growth. For 2001, noninterest income increased $47.8 million, or 39.1%, compared to 2000 due to these same factors. Noninterest
expenses incurred within the Agency Insurance segment increased $97.7 million, or 79.2%, while noninterest expenses allocated from other operating segments grew to $23.7 million. The increase in expenses allocated to Agency Insurance primarily
resulted from the purchased agencies discussed above. For 2001, noninterest expenses increased $36.1 million, or 41.4%, and intersegment noninterest expenses increased 3.1%.

The provision for income taxes allocated to Agency Insurance increased $1.1 million in 2002 and $4.8 million
in 2001 consistent with the growth in pretax income. Total identifiable segment assets for Agency Insurance more than tripled to a total of $551.7 million, primarily due to the acquisition of CRC, which is the 4

th

largest wholesale insurance broker in the country. In 2001, total identifiable segment assets increased 25.7%.

Investment Banking and Brokerage

Net interest income for the Investment Banking and Brokerage
segment totaled $7.5 million, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to 2001, which was $2.9 million lower than 2000 due to lower interest rates. Noninterest income produced from external customers increased $34.8 million, or 19.2% during 2002. For
2001, noninterest income increased $17.0 million compared to 2000. This increase resulted from higher fixed income securities underwriting fees, retail brokerage fees and investment banking income. Noninterest expenses incurred within the
Investment Banking and Brokerage segment increased $10.9 million, while noninterest expenses allocated from the other operating segments increased $13.2 million primarily due to the acquisition of Ryan Lee and the corresponding increase in full time
equivalent employees in the Investment Banking and Brokerage segment,


upon which certain expense allocations are based. Comparing 2001 and 2000, noninterest expenses increased $21.1 million due to higher
compensation expense, and intersegment noninterest expenses increased 6.3%.

The provision for income taxes allocated to Investment Banking and Brokerage increased $3.9 million, due to substantially higher pretax income from 2001. For 2001, the provision for income taxes
decreased $.7 million compared to 2000. Total identifiable assets for the Investment Banking and Brokerage segment increased 40.0% to a total of $982.8 million primarily due to the acquisition previously discussed. For 2001, total identifiable
segment assets decreased $49.7 million.

Treasury

Net interest
income for the Treasury segment totaled $222.1 million, a decrease of $52.2 million, or 19.0%, compared to 2001. This significant decrease is comprised of a $32.4 million decrease in net interest income from external customers and a $19.8 million
decrease in the net charge for funds allocated to the Treasury segment as calculated by BB&T’s internal FTP system. This large decrease is principally due to changes in the mix and profitability of securities held by the Treasury segment.
For 2001, net interest income increased $35.1 million compared to 2000. Noninterest income from external customers increased $201.6 million during 2002, principally due to securities gains taken during 2002 to economically offset writedowns in the
carrying value of BB&T’s capitalized mortgage servicing rights. For 2001, noninterest income increased $237.4 million compared to 2000 principally because of a restructuring of the securities portfolio, which resulted in securities losses
of approximately $222.2 million in 2000. Noninterest expenses incurred within the Treasury segment increased $7.4 million, while noninterest expenses allocated from the other operating segments decreased $.3 million. For 2001, noninterest expenses
increased $1.5 million and intersegment noninterest expenses increased $1.4 million.

The provision for income taxes allocated to the Treasury segment increased $45.5 million and $78.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, due to increases in pretax income. Total identifiable assets
for the Treasury segment increased 26.4% during 2002 to a total of $20.5 billion. For 2001, total identifiable segment assets for the Treasury segment decreased $875.3 million, or 5.1%.

Common Stock and Dividends

BB&T’s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on earnings from operations, the adequacy of capital and the availability
of liquid assets for distribution. BB&T’s ability to generate liquid assets for distribution is dependent on the ability of the Subsidiary Banks to pay dividends to the Parent Company. The payment of cash dividends is an integral part of
providing a competitive return on shareholders’ investments. The Corporation’s policy is to accomplish this while retaining sufficient capital to support future growth and to meet regulatory requirements. BB&T’s common dividend
payout ratio, computed by dividing dividends paid per common share by basic earnings per common share, was 40.00% in 2002 as compared to 45.58% in 2001. BB&T’s annual cash dividends paid per common share increased 12.2% during 2002 to $1.10
per common share for the year, as compared to $.98 per common share in 2001. This increase marked the 31st consecutive year that the Corporation’s annual cash dividend paid to shareholders has been increased. A discussion of dividend
restrictions is included in Note 15.—“Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions,” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” and “Regulatory Considerations.”


BB&T’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “BBT”. BB&T’s common stock was held by 145,174 shareholders of record at December 31, 2002 compared to
114,464 at December 31, 2001. The accompanying table, “Quarterly Summary of Market Prices and Dividends Paid on Common Stock,” sets forth the quarterly high, low and last sales prices for BB&T’s common stock based on the daily
closing price and the dividends paid per share of common stock for each of the last eight quarters.

Table 21

Quarterly Summary of Market Prices
and Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock

Fourth Quarter
Results

Net income for the fourth quarter
of 2002 was $337.3 million, compared to $277.9 million for the comparable period of 2001. On a per share basis, diluted net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $.70 compared to $.61 for the same period a year ago. Annualized returns on
average assets and average shareholders’ equity were 1.71% and 17.97%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to 1.56% and 17.93%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2001.

Net interest income on an FTE basis amounted to $742.9 million
for the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of 10.1% compared to $675.0 million for the same period of 2001. Noninterest income totaled $491.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, up 34.4% from $365.7 million earned during the fourth quarter of
2001. BB&T’s noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2002 totaled $654.3 million, up 20.1% from the $545.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001.

Due to an increased level of charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by management,
the fourth quarter 2002 provision for loan and lease losses increased 30.3% to $84.7 million, compared to $65.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2001.

The fourth quarter 2002 provision for income taxes totaled $123.2 million compared to $109.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2001, an
increase of 12.2%.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of BB&T is responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements, related financial data and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts
based on management’s estimates and judgment where appropriate. Financial information appearing throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with the financial statements.

BB&T’s accounting system, which records, summarizes and reports financial transactions, is supported
by an internal control structure that provides reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are recorded in accordance with BB&T’s policies and established accounting procedures. As an integral part of the internal
control structure, BB&T maintains a professional staff of internal auditors who monitor compliance with and assess the effectiveness of the internal control structure. Any system of internal control has inherent limitations and, because of the
dynamic nature of other systems within the Corporation, the effectiveness of BB&T’s internal control systems may vary over time.

The Audit Committee of BB&T’s Board of Directors, composed solely of outside directors, meets regularly with BB&T’s
management, internal auditors and independent public accountants to review matters relating to financial reporting, internal control structure and the nature, extent and results of the audit effort. The independent public accountants and the
internal auditors have access to the Audit Committee with or without management present.

The financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2002 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, who render an independent opinion on
management’s financial statements. Their appointment was recommended by the Audit Committee, approved by the Board of Directors and ratified by the shareholders. Their examination provides an objective assessment of the degree to which
BB&T’s management meets its responsibility for financial reporting. Their opinion on the financial statements is based on auditing procedures, which include reviewing the internal control structure to determine the timing and scope of audit
procedures and performing selected tests of transactions and records as they deem appropriate. These auditing procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the financial statements are fairly presented in all material
respects.

Management assessed the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2002. Based on the results of that assessment, management believes that BB&T’s system of internal controls provides reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and
transactions are recorded in accordance with BB&T’s policies and established accounting procedures.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BB&T Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 and the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in shareholders’ equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BB&T Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. The financial statements of BB&T Corporation as of December 31, 2001, and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001, prior to the revisions described in Note 7, were audited by other independent
accountants who have ceased operations. Those independent accountants expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements in their report dated January 28, 2002.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, upon adoption of new accounting
pronouncements effective during 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, and its method of accounting for loan commitments to be accounted for as derivatives.

As discussed above, the financial statements of BB&T
Corporation as of December 31, 2001, and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001, were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. As described in Note 7, these financial statements have been revised
to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002, and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 147,

Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 72 and 144 and FASB Interpretation No. 9

, which was adopted by the Company as of October 1, 2002. We audited the transitional disclosures
described in Note 7. In our opinion, the transitional disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in Note 7 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 or 2000 financial statements of the Company other than
with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 or 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To BB&T Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BB&T Corporation (a North Carolina corporation), and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.* These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BB&T Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2001* in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002,
2001 AND 2000

BB&T Corporation
(“BB&T” or “Parent Company”) is a financial holding company organized under the laws of North Carolina. Branch Banking and Trust Company (“Branch Bank”); Branch Banking and Trust Company of South Carolina
(“BB&T-SC”); Branch Banking and Trust Company of Virginia (“BB&T-VA”), (collectively, the “Banks” or “Subsidiary Banks”), Regional Acceptance Corporation (“Regional Acceptance”), and Scott
& Stringfellow, Inc., (“Scott & Stringfellow”) comprise BB&T’s principal direct subsidiaries.

The accounting and reporting policies of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The following is a summary of the more significant policies.

NOTE 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of BB&T include the
accounts of BB&T Corporation and those subsidiaries that are majority-owned by BB&T and over which BB&T exercises control. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The results of
operations of companies acquired in transactions accounted for as purchases are included only from the dates of acquisition. (See Note 2). All majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated unless control is temporary or does not rest with BB&T.
At December 31, 2002, there were no majority-owned subsidiaries that were not consolidated.

BB&T has certain investments in low-income housing and historic building rehabilitation projects that totaled $14.2 million at December 31, 2002. BB&T also has investments in limited
partnerships and limited liability corporations, including a small business investment company, venture capital funds and an electronic check processing consortium. These investments totaled $61.1 million at December 31, 2002. BB&T typically
acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships. BB&T accounts for its investments in these entities using the equity method.

Reclassifications

In certain instances, amounts reported in prior years’
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2002. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders’ equity or net income.

Nature of Operations

BB&T is a financial holding company headquartered in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina. BB&T conducts its operations primarily through its Subsidiary Banks, which have branches in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, Alabama, Indiana
and Washington, D.C. and, to a lesser extent, through its other subsidiaries. BB&T’s Subsidiary Banks provide a wide range of banking services to individuals and businesses. BB&T’s Subsidiary Banks offer a variety of loans to
businesses and consumers, including an array of mortgage loan products. BB&T’s loans are primarily to individuals residing in the market areas described above or to businesses located in this geographic area. BB&T’s Subsidiary
Banks also market a wide range of deposit services to individuals and businesses. BB&T’s Subsidiary Banks either directly or through their subsidiaries offer lease financing to businesses and municipal governments; discount brokerage
services and sales of annuities and mutual funds; life insurance, property and casualty insurance, health insurance and commercial general liability insurance on an agency basis; insurance premium financing; arranging permanent financing for
commercial real estate and providing loan servicing for third party investors; direct consumer finance loans to individuals; and asset management. The direct nonbank subsidiaries of BB&T provide a variety of financial services including
automobile lending, equipment financing, factoring, full-service securities brokerage, and capital markets services.


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan and lease
losses, valuation of mortgage servicing rights, valuation of goodwill and other intangibles and related impairment analyses, benefit plan obligations and expenses, and deferred tax assets or liabilities.

Business Combinations

Following the implementation of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141,

“Business Combinations,”

BB&T has accounted for all business combinations using the purchase method of accounting as required by the Statement. Under this method of accounting,
the accounts of an acquired institution are included with the acquirer’s accounts as of the date of acquisition with any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets recorded as goodwill. BB&T typically provides an
allocation period, not to exceed one year, to identify and determine the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations accounted for as purchases. Management currently does not anticipate any material
adjustments to the assigned values of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies.

To consummate an acquisition, BB&T typically issues common stock or pays cash, depending on the terms of the merger agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of acquired entities.
The value of shares issued in connection with purchase business combinations is determined based on the market price of the securities issued over a reasonable period of time, not to exceed three days before and three days after the terms of the
acquisition are agreed to and announced.

For
acquisitions in years prior to 2002 accounted for as poolings of interests, the financial information contained herein has been restated to include the accounts of the merged institutions for all periods presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with banks, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements. Both cash and cash equivalents have maturities of three months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such
instruments is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Securities

BB&T
classifies investment securities as held to maturity, available for sale or trading. Debt securities acquired with both the intent and ability to be held to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.

Debt securities, which may be sold to meet liquidity needs
arising from unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, changes in regulatory capital requirements, or unforeseen changes in market conditions, are classified as available for sale. In addition, all investments in equity securities are classified
as available for sale. Equity securities are primarily comprised of investments in stock issued by the FHLB of Atlanta, and preferred stocks issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) and the Federal National Mortgage
Association (“FNMA”). Securities available for sale are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes, in the shareholders’ equity
section of the consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses realized from the sale of securities


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

available for sale are determined by specific identification and are included in noninterest income. Premiums and discounts associated with
securities are amortized using the interest method.

Trading account securities are primarily held by Scott & Stringfellow, BB&T’s investment banking and full-service brokerage subsidiary. Trading account securities are reported at fair value. Market value adjustments,
fees, and gains or losses from trading account activities are included in noninterest income. Interest income on trading account securities is included in interest and dividends from securities. Gains or losses realized from the sale of trading
securities are determined by specific identification and are included in noninterest income.

During 2001 and 2000, BB&T transferred securities with amortized costs of $587.3 million and $324.7 million, respectively, from the held-to-maturity portfolio to the available-for-sale portfolio.
These securities were previously classified as held-to-maturity either by BB&T or by entities which merged into BB&T. BB&T transferred these amounts pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

in 2001, which permitted such transfers in conjunction with the adoption of the statement, and pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 115, “

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,

” in 2000 to conform the combined investment portfolios of acquired entities to BB&T’s existing policies. The unrealized gains or losses on these transferred securities were reflected as a component of shareholders’
equity.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or
market value on an aggregate loan portfolio basis. Gains or losses realized on the sales of loans are recognized at the time of sale and are determined by the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying value of the loans sold,
adjusted for any servicing asset or liability retained. Gains and losses on sales of loans are included in other noninterest income.

Loans and Leases

Loans and leases that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal
balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct costs
associated with the lending process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using methods which approximate the interest method. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income over the estimated
life of the loans using methods that approximate the interest method. Commercial loans and substantially all installment loans accrue interest on the unpaid balance of the loans. Lease receivables consist primarily of direct financing leases on
rolling stock, equipment and real property, leases to municipalities and investments in leveraged lease transactions. Lease receivables are stated at the total amount of lease payments receivable plus guaranteed residual values, less unearned
income. Leveraged leases are carried net of nonrecourse debt. Recognition of income over the lives of the lease contracts approximates the interest method.

A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that BB&T will be unable to collect all amounts due
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, at the loan’s
observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. When the fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the impairment is recorded through a specific reserve
allocation which is a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include loans and leases on which interest is not being accrued and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of
customers’ loan


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

defaults. Loans and leases are generally placed on nonaccrual status when concern exists that principal or interest is not fully collectible,
or when any portion of principal or interest becomes 90 days past due, whichever occurs first. Loans past due 90 days or more may remain on accrual status if management determines that concern over the collectibility of principal and interest is not
significant. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, interest receivable is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest payments received thereafter are applied as a reduction to the remaining principal balance as long as
concern exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal. Loans and leases are removed from nonaccrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and when concern no longer exists as to the collectibility of principal or
interest.

Assets acquired as a result of
foreclosure are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs. Cost is determined based on the sum of unpaid principal, accrued but unpaid interest and acquisition costs associated with the loan. Any excess of unpaid
principal over fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Generally, such properties are appraised annually and the carrying value, if greater than the fair value, less selling costs, is adjusted
with a charge to noninterest expense. Routine maintenance costs, declines in market value and net losses on disposal are included in other noninterest expense.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

The allowance for loan and lease losses is management’s estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan and lease portfolios
at the balance sheet date. The Company determines the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of cash flows expected to be received
on impaired loans. Those estimates may be susceptible to significant change. Increases to the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan and lease losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loans or leases
deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance.

The allowance is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. All components of the
allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to either SFAS No. 5 or SFAS No. 114. Management’s estimate of each SFAS No. 5 component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the
underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and industry concentrations; seasoning of the loan portfolio; the findings of internal credit quality
assessments and results from external bank regulatory examinations. Reserves for commercial loans are determined by applying loss percentages to the portfolio based on management’s evaluation and “risk grading” of the commercial loan
portfolio. Reserves are provided for noncommercial loan categories based on a four-year weighted average of actual loss experience, which is applied to the total outstanding loan balance of each loan category. Specific reserves are typically
provided on all impaired commercial loans in excess of a defined threshold that are classified in the Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful risk grades. The specific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management’s
evaluation of BB&T’s exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the value of any underlying collateral.

While management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the
allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or, if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to
original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.

Premises and Equipment

Premises, equipment, capital leases and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation or amortization. Land is stated at cost. In addition, purchased software and costs of computer


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

software developed for internal use are capitalized provided certain criteria are met. Depreciation and amortization are computed principally
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Capitalized
leases are amortized by the same methods as premises and equipment over the estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is less. Obligations under capital leases are amortized using the interest method to allocate payments between principal
reduction and interest expense.

Securities
Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured short-term borrowed funds, generally mature less than one year from the transaction date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at
the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. BB&T may be required to provide additional collateral if the fair value of the underlying securities declines during the term of the repurchase agreement.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is based upon income before
taxes for financial statement purposes, adjusted for nontaxable income and nondeductible expenses. Deferred income taxes have been provided when different accounting methods have been used in determining income for income tax purposes and for
financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future tax consequences attributable to differences arising from the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. In the
event of changes in the tax laws, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted in the period of the enactment of those changes, with the cumulative effects included in the current year’s income tax provision.

Derivative Financial Instruments

BB&T utilizes a variety of financial instruments to
manage various financial risks. These instruments, commonly referred to as derivatives, primarily consist of interest rate swaps, caps, floors, collars, financial forwards and futures contracts and options written and purchased. A derivative is a
financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. BB&T uses derivatives primarily to hedge business loans, forecasted sales of mortgage loans,
federal funds purchased, long-term debt and certificates of deposit. BB&T also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients.

BB&T accounts for derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended, which was implemented January 1, 2001, and requires all
derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. On the date of adoption, BB&T reassessed and designated derivative instruments used for risk management as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and derivatives not
qualifying for hedge accounting treatment, as appropriate. On January 1, 2001, BB&T had derivatives with a notional value of $2.3 billion. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 133, BB&T recorded a transition adjustment of $7.9
million, after taxes, to accumulated other comprehensive income. There was no material impact on net income at the date of adoption. The transition adjustment and BB&T’s accounting policies with regard to derivatives have been determined
based on the interpretive guidance issued thus far by the FASB. However, the FASB continues to issue guidance that could affect BB&T’s application of the Statement and require adjustments in the future.

Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as
notional amounts. Notional amounts only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties or a measure of financial risk. As required by SFAS No. 133, BB&T classifies
its derivative financial instruments as either (1) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recorded asset or


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

liability (“fair value hedge”), (2) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the cash flows of a recognized asset, liability or
forecasted transaction (“cash flow hedge”), (3) a hedge of a foreign currency exposure (“foreign currency hedge”), or (4) derivatives not designated as hedges. For a qualifying fair value hedge, changes in the value of the
derivatives that have been highly effective as hedges are recognized in current period earnings along with the corresponding changes in the value of the designated hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For a qualifying cash flow hedge,
the effective portion of changes in the value of the derivatives that have been highly effective are recognized in other comprehensive income until the related cash flows from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For either fair value hedges
or cash flow hedges, net income may be affected to the extent that changes in the value of the derivative instruments do not perfectly offset changes in the value of the hedged items. See Note 18 for additional disclosures related to derivative
financial instruments.

During 2002, BB&T
adopted Derivatives Implementation Group (“DIG”) Issue C-13

“When a Loan Commitment is included in the Scope of Statement 133,”

which required that residential mortgage loan commitments for loans to be sold be accounted
for as derivatives, and these derivatives were accounted for as non-hedging instruments. The impact upon adoption was a $14.5 million increase to mortgage banking income.

Per Share Data

Basic net income per common share has been computed by dividing net income applicable to common shares by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the years presented. Diluted net income per common share has been computed by dividing net income, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock
equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding. Restricted stock grants are considered as issued for purposes of calculating net income per share. See Note 19 for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of
the fair value of net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as purchases. Other intangible assets represent premiums paid for acquisitions of core deposits (core deposit intangibles) and other identifiable intangible assets. Such assets are
included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective January 1, 2002, BB&T adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

”, which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized
over an estimated useful life, but rather be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined to have finite lives, continue to be amortized on straight-line or accelerated bases over periods
ranging from one to nine years. SFAS No. 142 required the reversal of $9.8 million of remaining negative goodwill, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Please
refer to Note 7 for additional information with respect to BB&T’s goodwill and other intangible assets.

In October 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 147,

“Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 72 and 144 and FASB Interpretation No. 9,”

which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the acquisition of all or part of a financial institution. SFAS No. 147 removes acquisitions of financial institutions, except for
transactions between two or more mutual enterprises, from the scope of both SFAS No. 72 and Interpretation No. 9 and requires that those transactions be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

“Business Combinations,”

and
SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

SFAS No. 147 also amends SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”

to include in its scope long-term customer-relationship
and credit cardholder intangible assets, and requires companies to cease amortization of unidentifiable intangible assets associated with certain branch acquisitions. The provisions of this Statement were effective beginning October 1, 2002. The
implementation of this Statement resulted in a reversal of $3.7 million of pre-tax goodwill amortization during 2002. The provisions of the statement will not have a materially adverse impact on either BB&T’s consolidated financial position
or consolidated results of operations in the future.


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Loan Securitizations

BB&T periodically securitizes mortgage loans and transfers them to securities available for sale. This is accomplished by exchanging the loans for mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by
Freddie Mac. Following the transfers, the securities are reported at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes. Since the transfers
are not considered a sale, no gain or loss is recorded in conjunction with these transactions. BB&T also securitizes and sells loans to third party investors. BB&T retains the mortgage servicing on the loans sold and loans exchanged for
securities which are recorded based on the allocation of the carrying amounts of the assets sold between the assets sold and the servicing rights retained based on the relative fair value of the assets sold and the rights retained. Gains or losses
incurred on the loans sold to third party investors are included in mortgage banking income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

The carrying value of mortgage servicing rights are included as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mortgage servicing
rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenue. The amortization is adjusted prospectively in response to changes in estimated projections of future cash flows. BB&T periodically assesses mortgage
servicing rights for impairment based on the fair value of those rights. Impairment is evaluated by strata, which are based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rates, loan term and type. The fair value is significantly affected by
interest rates, prepayment speeds, expected losses and other terms. To the extent the carrying value of the servicing rights exceed the fair value by strata, impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance established through a charge to
mortgage banking income. The valuation allowance may be adjusted in the future as the value of the mortgage servicing rights increases or decreases. Revenues from originating, marketing and servicing mortgage loans as well as valuation adjustments
related to capitalized mortgage servicing rights are included in mortgage banking income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 8 for additional disclosures related to mortgage servicing rights.

Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

The following table presents data with
respect to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase transactions:

The
estimated fair values of the significant asset balances acquired and significant liabilities assumed at the dates of acquisition for the institutions acquired during 2002 are as follows: cash and cash equivalents totaling $952.7 million; investment
securities of $574.9 million; loans and leases of $4.3 billion; deposits totaling $4.3 billion; short-term borrowed funds totaling $732.6 million; and long-term debt of $307.9 million.

Stock-Based Compensation

BB&T maintains various stock-based compensation plans. These plans provide for the granting of stock
options to BB&T’s employees and directors. All of BB&T’s stock-based compensation plans have been presented to and approved by BB&T’s shareholders. BB&T accounts for its stock option plans based on the intrinsic value
method set forth in APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations, under which no compensation cost has been recognized for any of the periods presented, except with respect to restricted stock plans as disclosed in the accompanying table. The
following table presents BB&T’s net income, basic and diluted earnings per share as reported and pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share assuming compensation cost for BB&T’s stock options plans had been determined
based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

granted after December 31, 1994, consistent with the method described by SFAS No. 123 “

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

”:

The fair
value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: dividend yield of 3.0% in 2002 and 2.5%
in 2001 and 2000; expected volatility of 27% in 2002, 28% in 2001 and 29% in 2000; risk free interest rates of 4.7%, 4.9% and 6.6% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively; and expected lives of 6.0 years, 6.0 years and 6.1 years for 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Because the SFAS No. 123
method of accounting has not been applied to options granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.

Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New
Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”

which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. The provisions of the statement, which were adopted January 1, 2003, did not have a material impact on either BB&T’s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”

which supercedes SFAS No. 121,

“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,”

and the accounting
and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, “

Reporting the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions

.”
The Statement establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by a sale, and resolves significant implementation issues related to SFAS No. 121. The provisions of the Statement were adopted by BB&T on January 1,
2002. The implementation did not have a material impact on either BB&T’s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.

In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,

“Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
and Technical Corrections as of April 2002”

. This Statement rescinds SFAS No. 4,

“Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt”

, and an amendment of that Statement,


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

SFAS No. 64,

“Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements.”

This Statement also rescinds SFAS No. 44,

“Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers”

and amends SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

, to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required
accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. This Statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or
describe their applicability under changed conditions. BB&T adopted the provisions of this Statement effective January 1, 2003. This implementation did not initially have a material impact on either BB&T’s consolidated financial
position or consolidated results of operations, and management does not expect any such impact in the future.

In August 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146

, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”.

SFAS
No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. This Statement nullifies the guidance of the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) in EITF Issue
No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)”

. Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, an entity recognized a liability
for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan. In SFAS No. 146, the Board acknowledges that an entity’s commitment to a plan does not, by itself, create a present obligation to other parties that meets the
definition of a liability. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability. SFAS No. 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002.
BB&T adopted the provisions of this Statement effective January 1, 2003. The initial adoption of the statement did not materially affect BB&T, and management does not anticipate that provisions of the Statement will have a materially adverse
impact on either BB&T’s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations in the future although its provisions will affect the timing of the recognition of merger-related costs.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure”

, which amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. The provisions of the statement were effective December 31, 2002. Management currently intends to continue to account for stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method set forth in Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) Opinion 25 and related interpretations. For this reason, the transition guidance of SFAS No. 148 does not have an impact on BB&T’s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. The Statement
does amend existing guidance with respect to required disclosures, regardless of the method of accounting used. The revised disclosure requirements are presented herein.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.”

The Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements under certain guarantees that it has
issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements of the Interpretation are
effective and were adopted by BB&T as of December 31, 2002, and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee, the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, and the current
amount of the liability, if any, for the guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee. Please refer to Note 14 for disclosures with respect to BB&T’s guarantees. The recognition requirements of the Interpretation were effective
beginning January 1, 2003. Management does not anticipate that the implementation of the recognition requirements of the Interpretation will have a significant effect on BB&T’s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of
operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued
FASB Interpretation No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”

This Interpretation provides guidance with respect to the identification of variable interest entities and when the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling
interests, and results of operations of a variable interest entity need to be included in a company’s consolidated financial statements. The Interpretation requires consolidation by


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

business enterprises of variable interest entities in cases where the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity, or in cases where the equity investors lack one
or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, which include the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting rights, the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they
occur, or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. The Interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise
obtains an interest after that date. BB&T’s management is currently assessing the impact that the Interpretation will have on BB&T’s consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. In particular, BB&T is
a limited partner in low income housing developments throughout its market area, which as previously discussed, are not included in BB&T’s consolidated financial statements. Based on an initial assessment, management believes BB&T may
be required to consolidate a portion of these investments effective July 1, 2003 to comply with Interpretation No. 46. As of December 31, 2002, BB&T’s maximum potential exposure to loss with respect to these partnerships was
$15.7 million.

Insurance Acquisitions

In addition to the mergers and acquisitions summarized in the above table, BB&T acquired eight insurance agencies during 2002, which were accounted for as purchases. In conjunction with these
transactions, BB&T issued approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock and paid $1.9 million in cash, and recorded $43.7 million in goodwill and $30.4 million of other intangible assets with an average life of 10 years. During 2001, BB&T
acquired seven insurance agencies that were accounted for as purchases. In conjunction with these transactions, BB&T issued approximately 325 thousand shares of common stock and recorded $16.5 million in goodwill and other intangible assets.
During 2000, BB&T acquired six insurance agencies, which were accounted for as purchases. In conjunction with these transactions, BB&T issued 1.4 million shares of common stock and recorded $38.9 million in goodwill. These insurance
acquisitions did not materially affect BB&T’s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.

BB&T also acquired four nonbank financial services companies during 2002, all accounted for as purchases. In connection with these
acquisitions, BB&T issued approximately 500 thousand shares of common stock and paid $10.3 million in cash. Goodwill totaling $20.7 million and other intangibles totaling $9.0 million with a life of 10 years were initially recorded in connection
with the transactions.

The following unaudited
presentation reflects selected information from the Consolidated Income Statements on a Pro Forma basis as if the purchase transactions had been completed as of the beginning of the years presented:

Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges

In conjunction with the consummation of an acquisition and the completion of other requirements, BB&T typically accrues certain merger-related expenses related to estimated severance costs, costs to terminate lease contracts,
costs related to the disposal of duplicate facilities and equipment, costs to terminate data processing contracts and other costs associated with the acquisition. The following table presents costs reflected as expenses and accruals recorded through
purchase accounting adjustments.

The
liabilities for severance and personnel-related costs relate to severance liabilities that will be paid out based on such factors as termination dates, the provisions of employment contracts and the terms of BB&T’s


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

severance plans. The occupancy and equipment accruals relate to costs to exit certain leases and to dispose of excess facilities and
equipment. This liability will be utilized upon termination of the various leases and sale of redundant property. The liabilities associated with systems conversions relate to termination penalties on contracts with information technology service
providers. These liabilities will be utilized as the contracts are paid out and expire. The other merger-related liabilities relate to litigation accruals, accruals to conform the accounting policies of acquired institutions to those of BB&T,
and other similar charges. The merger-related accruals presented above are expected to be utilized in 2003 unless they relate to specific contracts that expire in later years.

During 2002, BB&T estimated that 372 positions would be eliminated and 370 employees were terminated
prior to December 31, 2002. Approximately 90 of these employees will continue to receive severance payments during 2003. During 2001, BB&T estimated that approximately 400 positions would be eliminated and approximately 350 employees were
terminated and received severance by the end of 2001. During 2000, BB&T estimated that 450 positions would be eliminated in connection with mergers and approximately 430 employees were terminated and received severance.

Because BB&T often has multiple merger integrations in
process, and, due to limited resources, must schedule in advance significant events in the merger conversion and integration process, BB&T’s merger process and utilization of merger accruals may cover an extended period of time. In general,
a major portion of accrued costs are utilized in conjunction with or immediately following the systems conversion, when most of the duplicate positions are eliminated and the terminated employees begin to receive severance. Other accruals are
utilized over time based on the sale, closing or disposal of duplicate facilities or equipment or the expiration of lease contracts. Merger accruals are re-evaluated regularly and adjusted as necessary.

Since BB&T is a frequent acquirer of financial
institutions, the Company has a number of employees who have among their primary responsibilities the analysis of mergers and acquisitions, the acquisition approval process and/or converting the systems of acquired entities to BB&T’s
automation platform. Substantially all of the expenses associated with these employees are on-going and are not classified as merger-related.

The accruals utilized during 2002 in the table above include $10.5 million of accrual reversals resulting from revisions to
BB&T’s initial estimates of merger accruals for facilities and personnel-related costs. There were no other material adjustments to merger-related accruals for any of the periods presented.

Pending Mergers (unaudited)

On September 27, 2002, BB&T announced plans to acquire
Equitable Bank (“Equitable”), based in Wheaton, Maryland. At the time of the announcement, Equitable had $477 million in assets and operated five full-service banking offices in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties. Shareholders of
Equitable will receive one share of BB&T common stock in exchange for each share of Equitable. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase, and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2003.

On December 4, 2002, BB&T announced plans to acquire
Southeastern Fidelity Corporation (“SEFCO”), an insurance premium finance company based in Tallahassee, Florida. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase, and, pending regulatory approval, is planned to be completed in the first
quarter of 2003.

On January 21, 2003, BB&T
announced plans to acquire First Virginia Banks, Inc. (“First Virginia”), a bank holding company headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia. First Virginia is the parent company to eight community banks and operated 364 branches in Virginia,
Maryland, and northeast Tennessee at the time of the announcement. At December 31, 2002, First Virginia had $11.2 billion in assets, including $6.4 billion in loans and $4.0 billion in investment securities, and total deposits of $9.2 billion.
Shareholders of First Virginia will receive 1.26 BB&T shares in exchange for each share of First Virginia. The merger, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2003.

NOTE 3.    Securities

The amortized costs and approximate fair values of securities held to maturity and available for sale were as follows:

Securities with book values of approximately $9.2 billion and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were pledged to secure municipal deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other borrowings, and
for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

Excluding securities issued by the U.S. Government and its agencies and corporations, there were no investments in securities from one issuer that exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2002 or 2001. Trading
securities totaling $148.5 million at December 31, 2002 and $97.7 million at December 31, 2001 are excluded from the accompanying tables. Equity securities are primarily composed of investments in stock issued by the FHLB of Atlanta and preferred
stocks issued by FHLMC and FNMA.

Proceeds from
sales of securities available for sale during 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $3.6 billion, $3.0 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. Gross gains of $181.1 million, $130.6 million and $7.2 million and gross losses of $11.0 million, $8.4 million and
$226.6 million were realized on those sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2002, by contractual maturity, are shown in the accompanying table. The expected life of mortgage-backed
securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the underlying mortgage loans with or without call or prepayment penalties. For purposes of the maturity table, mortgage-backed securities,
which are not due at a single maturity date, have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the weighted average contractual maturities of underlying collateral.

NOTE 4.    Loans and Leases

The following is a breakdown of the loan and lease portfolio at year-end by major category:

The net
investment in lease receivables was $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, BB&T had investments of approximately $14.2 million and $11.4 million, respectively in multi-family low
income housing developments throughout its market area as a means of supporting its communities. BB&T’s subsidiary banks typically provide financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing is
generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project.

BB&T had $37.7 billion in loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2002. However, these loans were not concentrated in any specific industry, market or geographic area other than the Banks'
primary markets.

NOTE 5.    Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

An analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses for each of the past three years is presented in the following table:

At
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, loans and leases not currently accruing interest totaled $374.8 million, $316.6 million and $180.6 million, respectively. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest totaled $115.0 million, $101.8
million and $81.6 million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The gross interest income that would have been earned during 2002, 2001 and 2000 if the loans and leases then classified as nonaccrual had been current in accordance with
the original terms was approximately $22.0 million, $23.9 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Foreclosed property totaled $76.6 million, $57.0 million and $55.2 million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 6.    Premises and Equipment

A summary of premises and equipment is presented in the
accompanying table:

Premises
and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Useful lives for premises and equipment are as follows: buildings and building improvements—40 years; furniture and equipment—5 to
10 years; and capitalized leases on premises and equipment—estimated useful life or remaining term of tenant lease, whichever is less.

Depreciation expense, which is included in occupancy and equipment expense, was $144.0 million, $122.2 million and $116.2 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. BB&T has noncancelable leases covering certain premises and equipment. Total rent expense applicable to operating leases was $77.8 million, $68.0 million and $66.4 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE
8.    Loan Servicing

The following is an analysis of BB&T’s mortgage servicing rights included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The table above includes mortgage servicing rights arising from BB&T’s residential mortgage operations and commercial mortgage banking activities. Following is an analysis of the aggregate
changes in the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights in 2002, 2001 and 2000:

The
unpaid principal balances of BB&T’s total residential mortgage servicing portfolio were $34.8 billion, $29.0 billion and $23.6 billion at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The unpaid principal balances of mortgage loans
serviced for others were $24.2 billion, $20.4 billion and $15.8 billion at December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in loans on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During 2002 and 2001, BB&T securitized and sold $10.8
billion and $8.7 billion, respectively of principally fixed rate residential mortgage loans and recognized pretax gains of $48.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, which was recorded in noninterest income. BB&T retained the related mortgage
servicing rights and receives annual servicing fees. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the approximate weighted average servicing fee was .39% and .41%, respectively, of the outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans.

At December 31, 2002, BB&T had $1.1 billion of mortgage
loans sold with limited recourse liability. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, BB&T has exposure of approximately $448.1 million on these mortgage loans.

BB&T also arranges and services commercial real estate mortgages through Laureate Capital, the commercial
mortgage banking subsidiary of Branch Bank. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, Laureate Capital originated $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of commercial real estate mortgages, all of which are arranged for third party
investors and serviced by Laureate Capital. Laureate Capital’s exposure to credit risk or interest rate risk as a result of these loans is minimal. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, Laureate Capital’s portfolio of commercial real estate
mortgages serviced for others totaled $6.4 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in loans on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

BB&T uses assumptions and estimates in determining the
fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights. These assumptions include prepayment speeds, net charge-off experience and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

At December 31, 2002, the sensitivity of the current fair value of the residential mortgage servicing rights to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in key economic assumptions are included in the
accompanying table.

The
sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is calculated without
changing any other assumption; while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which might magnify or counteract
the effect of the change.

In 2001 and prior, the
Company also has securitized residential mortgage loans and retained the resulting securities in securities available for sale. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining unpaid principle balance of the underlying loans totalled $501.0 million. Based on
the performance of the underlying loans and general liquidity of the securities, the Company’s recovery of the cost basis in the securities has not been significantly impacted by changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or credit losses.

The following table includes a summary of
mortgage loans managed or securitized and related delinquencies and net charge-offs.

Balances exclude loans serviced for others, with no other continuing involvement.

NOTE 11.    Shareholders’ Equity

The authorized capital stock of BB&T consists of
1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $5 par value, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $5 par value. At December 31, 2002, 470,452,260 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

Stock Option Plans

At December 31, 2002, BB&T had the following stock-based
compensation plans: the 1994 and 1995 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plans (“Omnibus Plans”), the Incentive Stock Option Plan (“ISOP”), the Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (“NQSOP”) and the Non-Employee Directors’ Stock
Option Plan (“Directors’ Plan”), which are described below.

BB&T issues options to purchase shares of its common stock in exchange for options outstanding at acquired entities at the time the merger is completed. To the extent vested, the options are
considered to be part of the purchase price paid. There is no change in the aggregate intrinsic value of the options issued compared to the intrinsic value of the options held immediately before the exchange, nor does the ratio of the exercise price
per option to the market value per share change.

The shareholders have previously approved the Omnibus Plans which cover the award of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, shares of restricted stock, performance shares and stock appreciation rights.

The provisions of the 1995 Omnibus Plan also provide for an
automatic increase in the authorized number of shares issuable, equal to 3% of any increase in the Corporation’s outstanding common shares. Including options authorized under these provisions and various shareholder amendments to the plan, the
maximum number of shares issuable under the 1995 Omnibus Plan was 37.6 million at December 31, 2002. The combined shares issuable under both Omnibus Plans is 45.6 million at December 31, 2002. The Omnibus Plans are intended to allow BB&T to
recruit and retain employees with ability and initiative and to associate the employees’ interests with

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

those of BB&T and its shareholders. At December 31, 2002, 13.9 million qualified stock options at prices ranging from $6.86 to $51.41 and
7.7 million non-qualified stock options at prices ranging from no cost to $53.10 were outstanding. The stock options generally vest over 3 years and have a 10-year term.

The ISOP and the NQSOP were established to retain key officers and key management employees and to offer them
the incentive to use their best efforts on behalf of BB&T. The plans further provided for up to 2.2 million shares of common stock to be reserved for the granting of options, which have a four year vesting schedule and must be exercised
within ten years from the date granted. These plans expired on December 19, 2000; however, any options previously granted under the plans will be available to be exercised for ten years. No additional grants will be made pursuant to these plans.
Incentive stock options granted had an exercise price equal to at least 100% of the fair market value of common stock on the date granted, and the non-qualified stock options were required to have an exercise price equal to at least 85% of the fair
market value on the date granted. At December 31, 2002, options to purchase 28,554 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $9.1875 were outstanding pursuant to the NQSOP. At December 31, 2002, options to purchase 51,098 shares of common stock
at an exercise price of $9.8885 were outstanding pursuant to the ISOP.

The Directors’ Stock Option Plan is intended to provide incentives to non-employee directors to remain on the Board of Directors and share in the profitability of BB&T. The plan creates a deferred compensation
system for participating non-employee directors. Each non-employee director may elect to defer 0%, 50% or 100% of the annual retainer fee for each calendar year and apply that percentage toward the grant of options to purchase BB&T common stock.
Such elections are required to be in writing and are irrevocable for each calendar year. The exercise price at which shares of BB&T common stock may be purchased shall be equal to 75% of the market value of the common stock as of the date of
grant. Options are vested after six months and may be exercised anytime thereafter until the expiration date, which is ten years from the date of grant. The Directors’ Plan provides for the reservation of up to 1.8 million shares of BB&T
common stock. At December 31, 2002, options to purchase 895,116 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $6.9156 to $28.8719 were outstanding pursuant to the Directors’ Plan.

BB&T also has options outstanding that were granted by certain acquired companies. These options, which
have not been included in the plans described above, totaled 77,094 as of December 31, 2002, with option prices ranging from $8.083 to $10.53.

A summary of the status of the Company’s stock option plans at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 and changes during the years then
ended is presented below:

The weighted average fair value of options granted was $9.07, $10.00 and $7.78 per option for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The following table summarizes information about the options
outstanding at December 31, 2002:

Share
Repurchase Activity

BB&T has
periodically repurchased shares of its own common stock. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 141, principally all repurchased shares were reissued in business combinations accounted for as purchases. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, BB&T repurchased 21.8 million shares, 14.0 million shares and 7.1 million shares of common stock, respectively. In accordance with North Carolina law, repurchased shares cannot be held as treasury stock, but revert to the status of
authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase.

Shareholder Rights Plan

On January 17, 1997, pursuant to the Rights Agreement approved by the Board of Directors, BB&T distributed to shareholders one preferred stock purchase right for each share of BB&T’s common stock then outstanding.
Subsequent to this date, all shares issued are accompanied by a stock purchase right. Initially, the rights, which expire in 10 years, are not exercisable and are not transferable apart from the common stock. The rights will become exercisable only
if a person or group acquires 20% or more of BB&T’s common stock, or BB&T’s Board of Directors determines, pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, that any person or group that has acquired 10% or more of BB&T’s
common stock is an “Adverse Person.” Each right would then enable the holder to purchase 1/100th of a share of a new series of BB&T preferred stock at an initial exercise price of $145.00. The Board of Directors will be entitled to
redeem the rights at $.01 per right under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement.

Under the terms of the Rights Agreement, if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 25% or more of BB&T’s common
stock, with certain exceptions, or if the Board of Directors determines that any 10% or more stockholder is an “Adverse Person,” each right will entitle its holder (other than the person triggering exercisability of the rights) to
purchase, at the right’s then-current exercise price, shares of BB&T’s common stock having a value of twice the right’s exercise price. In addition, if after any person or group has become a 20% or more stockholder, BB&T is
involved in a merger or other business combination transaction with another person in which its common stock is changed or converted, or sells 50% or more of its assets or earning power to another person, each right will entitle its holder to
purchase, at the right’s then-current exercise price, shares of common stock of such other person having a value of twice the right’s exercise price.

Note 12.    Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was composed of the following:

The
income tax provisions in the above table do not include the effects of income tax deductions resulting from exercises of stock options, which amounted to $16.4 million, $19.6 million and $6.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively and were
recorded as increases in shareholders' equity. The foreign income tax expense included in the 2002 provision for income taxes is related to income generated on assets controlled by a foreign subsidiary of Branch Bank.

The reasons for the difference between the provision for
income taxes and the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes were as follows:

During
the last three years, BB&T entered into option contracts which legally transferred responsibility for the management of future residuals of certain leveraged lease investments including the future remarketing or re-leasing of these assets to a
wholly-owned subsidiary in a foreign jurisdiction having a lower income tax rate, thereby lowering the effective income tax rate applicable to these lease investments. These option contracts provide that the foreign subsidiary may purchase the lease
investments at expiration of the existing leveraged leases for a fixed price. As a result, a portion of the residual value included in the consolidated leverage lease analysis should be taxed at a lower tax rate than originally anticipated,
resulting in a change in the total net income from the lease. The net income from the affected leases was recalculated from inception based on the new


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

effective income tax rate. The recalculation had the effect of reducing net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, by $9.7 million, $40.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively, and reducing the income tax provisions for the last three years by $20.2 million, $56.6 million and $19.8 million, respectively. BB&T intends to permanently reinvest the
earnings of this subsidiary and, therefore, deferred income taxes associated with the foreign subsidiary arising from these transactions have not been provided.

During 2001, Branch Bank transferred certain securities and real estate secured loans to a subsidiary in
exchange for additional common equity in the subsidiary. The transaction resulted in a difference between Branch Bank’s tax basis in the equity investment in the subsidiary and the assets transferred to the subsidiary. This difference in basis
resulted in a net reduction in the provision for income taxes of $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in
other liabilities in the "Consolidated Balance Sheets" were:

Securities transactions resulted in income tax expense (benefits) of $65.3 million, $46.5 million and ($76.8 million) related to securities gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
is conducting an examination of BB&T’s Federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998. In connection with this examination the IRS has issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment with respect to BB&T’s
income tax treatment of certain leveraged lease investments that were entered into during the years under examination. Management believes that BB&T’s treatment of these leveraged leases was appropriate and in compliance with existing tax
laws and regulations, and intends to vigorously defend this position. In addition, inasmuch as the proposed adjustments relate primarily to the timing of taxable revenue recognition and amortization expense, deferred taxes have been provided.
Management does not expect that BB&T’s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations will be materially adversely affected as a result of the IRS examination.

NOTE 13.    Benefit Plans

BB&T provides various benefit plans to
all employees, including employees of acquired entities. Employees of acquired entities generally participate in existing BB&T plans upon consummation of the business combinations. The plans of acquired institutions are typically merged into the
BB&T plans upon consummation of the mergers, and, under these circumstances, credit is usually given to these employees for years of service at the acquired institution for vesting and eligibility purposes.

The following table summarizes expenses relating to employee
retirement plans.

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans

BB&T provides a defined benefit retirement plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code that covers substantially all employees. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement and the employee’s compensation
during the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment. BB&T’s contributions to the plan are in amounts between the minimum required for funding standard accounts and the maximum deductible for federal
income tax purposes.

In addition, supplemental
retirement benefits are provided to certain key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. Although technically unfunded plans, insurance policies on the lives of
the covered employees partially fund future benefits.

Financial data relative to the defined benefit pension plans is summarized in the following tables for the years indicated:

common stock at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension

BB&T provides certain postretirement benefits that cover employees retiring after December 31, 1995, who are eligible for participation in the BB&T pension plan and have at least ten years of service. The plan
requires retiree contributions, with a subsidy by BB&T based upon years of service of the employee at the time of retirement. The subsidy may be reviewed for adjustment. The plan provides health care and life insurance benefits to retirees or
their dependents.

The following tables set forth
the components of the retiree benefit plan and the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

401(k) Savings Plan

BB&T offers a 401(k) Savings Plan that permits employees with more than 90 days service to contribute from 1% to 25% of their compensation. For full-time employees who are 21 years of age or older
with one year or more of service, BB&T makes matching contributions of up to 6% of the employee’s compensation. BB&T’s contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan totaled $37.0 million, $31.2 million and $20.6 million for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Other

There are various
other employment contracts, deferred compensation arrangements and covenants not to compete with selected members of management and certain retirees.

Note 14.    Commitments and Contingencies

BB&T utilizes a variety of financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to reduce
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, options written, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, interest rate caps and floors written, interest rate swaps and forward
and futures contracts. The following table presents the contractual or notional amount of these instruments:

Standby
letters of credit and financial guarantees written are unconditional commitments issued by BB&T to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. As of December 31, 2002, BB&T had issued $1.2 billion in such guarantees
predominantly for terms of one year or less. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuance, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in
issuance of these guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers and as such, are collateralized when necessary.

In the ordinary course of business, BB&T enters into indemnification agreements for legal proceedings against its directors and
officers and those of acquired entities. BB&T also issues standard representation warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales (See Note 8), brokerage activities and other similar arrangements.
Counterparties in many of these indemnifications provide similar indemnifications to BB&T. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T has not been required to act on the guarantees and does not believe that any payments
pursuant to them would materially change the financial condition or results of operations as presented herein.

Merger and acquisition agreements of businesses other than financial institutions occasionally include additional incentives to the
acquired entities to offset the loss of future cash flows previously received through


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

ownership positions. Typically, these incentives are based on the acquired entity’s contribution to BB&T’s earnings compared to
agreed-upon amounts. When offered, these incentives are issued for terms of three to eight years. In the aggregate, the maximum potential contingent consideration included in these agreements is $14.2 million over the next five years.

Forward commitments to sell mortgage loans and
mortgage-backed securities are contracts for delayed delivery of securities in which BB&T agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise from the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities’ values and interest rates.

BB&T invests in certain low income housing and historic building rehabilitation projects throughout its market area as a means of
supporting local communities, and receives tax credits related to these investments. BB&T typically acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships.
BB&T’s subsidiary banks typically provide financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project. BB&T’s
outstanding commitments to fund low income housing investments totaled $168.9 million and $169.2 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Legal Proceedings

The nature of the business of BB&T’s banking and other subsidiaries ordinarily results in a certain amount of litigation. The
subsidiaries of BB&T are involved in various legal proceedings, all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. Management believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from these proceedings will not have a materially
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of BB&T.

NOTE 15.    Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions

BB&T’s subsidiary banks are required by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain reserve balances in the
form of vault cash or deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank based on specified percentages of certain deposit types, subject to various adjustments. At December 31, 2002, the net reserve requirement amounted to $508.2 million.

BB&T’s subsidiary banks are prohibited from paying
dividends from their capital stock and additional paid-in capital accounts and are required by regulatory authorities to maintain minimum capital levels. Subject to restrictions imposed by state laws and federal regulations, the Boards of Directors
of the subsidiary banks could have declared dividends to the parent company from their retained earnings up to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2002.

BB&T is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum
capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory—and possibly additional discretionary—actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on BB&T’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy
guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Corporation must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of BB&T’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated
pursuant to regulatory directives. BB&T’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. BB&T is in full compliance with these
requirements. Banking regulations also identify five capital categories for insured depository institutions: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. BB&T and
each of the Subsidiary Banks are classified as “well-capitalized”.


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require BB&T to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to
risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets.

NOTE 17.    Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

A financial
instrument is defined by SFAS No. 107, “

Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

,” as cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity or a contract that creates a contractual obligation or right to deliver or
receive cash or another financial instrument from a second entity on potentially favorable or unfavorable terms.

Fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data and information about the financial instrument. SFAS No.
107 specifies that fair values should be calculated based on the value of one trading unit without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership of a financial instrument, possible tax ramifications, estimated
transaction costs that may result from bulk sales or the relationship between various financial instruments. No readily available market exists for a significant portion of BB&T’s financial instruments. Fair value estimates for these
instruments are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, currency and interest rate risk characteristics, loss experience and other factors. Many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and
cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, the calculated fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument. Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

The following methods and assumptions were used by BB&T in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents:

For these short-term instruments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair values.

Securities:

Fair values for securities
are based on quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities.

Loans receivable:

The fair values for loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using
interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms and credit quality. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair values. The fair values of loans held for sale approximate their carrying values.

Deposit liabilities:

The fair values for demand
deposits, interest-checking accounts, savings accounts and certain money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date, i.e., their carrying amounts. Fair values for certificates of deposit and other
time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current interest rates to aggregate expected maturities.

Short-term borrowed funds:

The carrying amounts of Federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, master notes
and other short-term borrowed funds approximate their fair values.

Long-term debt:

The fair values of long-term debt are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses,
based on BB&T’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.

Derivative financial instruments:

The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on dealer quotes.

Commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written:

The fair
values of commitments are estimated using the fees charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair
values also consider the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

rates. The fair values of guarantees and letters of credit are estimated based on fees currently charged for similar agreements.

The following is a summary of the carrying
amounts and fair values of BB&T’s financial assets and liabilities:

The following table sets forth certain information concerning BB&T’s derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2002:

Derivative Financial Instruments

December 31, 2002

The
following table discloses data with respect to BB&T’s derivative financial instruments:

Derivative Classifications and Hedging Relationships

December 31,

(Dollars in thousands)

At
December 31, 2002, BB&T had designated $1.4 billion in notional value of derivatives as fair value hedges. These instruments had a net unrealized gain of approximately $101.3 million at December 31, 2002. Derivatives in a gain position with a
fair value of $102.2 million are recorded in other assets and derivatives in a loss position with a fair value of $0.9 million are recorded in other liabilities. There was no impact on earnings during the period resulting from fair value hedge
ineffectiveness since all BB&T’s fair value hedges qualify for the “short cut method” assumption of no ineffectiveness under the provisions of SFAS No. 133.


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

BB&T had also designated $8.6 billion in notional value of derivatives as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. These instruments had a net estimated fair value of $33.5 million at the end of the
year. The effect on earnings resulting from the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was not material.

Accumulated other comprehensive income includes $1.6 million of net after-tax unrecognized gains attributable to cash flow hedges. A total
of $7.3 million of unrecognized losses is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. Unrecognized losses on mandatory forward commitments and long put options hedging the cash flows of forecasted sales of mortgage loans
totaled $27.8 million after-tax. BB&T typically sells fixed-rate mortgage loans shortly after origination. BB&T is exposed to variability in cash flows from the forecasted sale due to interest rate risk. The risk management objective is to
hedge the price at which the loans will ultimately be sold. This objective is met by entering into mandatory forward commitments and long put options that establish the proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans at inception. The ultimate sale of the
related loans will result in reclassification of these amounts into earnings. If the cash flow hedge is discontinued because the forecasted sales of mortgage loans will not occur, this amount would be immediately reclassified into earnings.

Accumulated other comprehensive income included
$43.0 million in after-tax unrecognized gains on interest rate swaps hedging variable interest payments on business loans and $13.6 million in unrecognized losses on interest rate caps hedging variable interest payments on overnight borrowings.
BB&T has substantial business loans and overnight borrowings that expose it to variability in cash flows for interest payments. The risk management objective is to hedge the variability in these interest payments. This objective is met by
entering into interest swaps that fix the interest payments and interest rate caps that fix the interest payments when interest rates on the hedged item exceed the predetermined rate. These gains or losses will be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to earnings as the interest payments on the hedged item affect earnings. Immediate reclassification would only be required if it becomes probable the hedged transactions will not occur.

BB&T also held $1.6 billion in notional value of
derivatives not designated as hedges at December 31, 2002. These instruments were in a net gain position with a net estimated fair value of $14.7 million. In connection with the adoption of DIG Issue C-13, income from interest rate lock commitments
for residential mortgage loans to be sold accounted for $14.5 million of this gain. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are reflected in current period earnings. Substantially all derivatives not designated as a hedge have been entered
into to facilitate transactions on behalf of BB&T’s clients. Excluding the interest rate lock commitments, BB&T typically also simultaneously enters into a derivative financial instrument with substantially similar offsetting terms with
an unrelated third party. Therefore, these other derivatives have minimal impact on earnings.

The maximum length of time over which BB&T is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions, excluding those forecasted transactions related to the
payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments, is less than one year and is 4.9 years including those forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments.

Credit risk related to derivatives arises when amounts
receivable from a counterparty exceed those payable. Because the notional amount of the instruments only serves as a basis for calculating amounts receivable or payable, the risk of loss with any counterparty is limited to a small fraction of the
notional amount. BB&T deals only with national market makers with strong credit ratings in its derivatives activities. BB&T further controls the risk of loss by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used
in making loans and other extensions of credit. All of the derivative contracts to which BB&T is a party settle monthly, quarterly or semiannually. Further, BB&T has netting agreements with the dealers with which it does business. Because of
these factors, BB&T’s credit risk exposure related to derivatives contracts at December 31, 2002, was not material.

Note 19.    Computation of Earnings
Per Share

The basic and diluted earnings
per share calculations are presented in the following table:

NOTE
20.    Operating Segments

BB&T’s operations are divided into six reportable business segments: the Banking Network, Mortgage Banking, Trust Services, Agency Insurance, Investment Banking and Brokerage, and Treasury. These operating segments have been
identified based on BB&T’s organizational structure. The segments require unique technology and marketing strategies and offer different products and services. While BB&T is managed as an integrated organization, individual executive
managers are held accountable for the operations of these business segments.

BB&T measures and presents information for internal reporting purposes in a variety of different ways. Information for BB&T’s reportable segments is available based on organizational
structure, product offerings and customer relationships. The internal reporting system presently utilized by management in the planning and measuring of operating activities, as well as the system to which most managers are held accountable, is
based on organizational structure.


BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

BB&T emphasizes revenue growth by focusing on client service, sales effectiveness and relationship management. The segment results contained herein are presented based on internal management
accounting policies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles.
Therefore, the performance of the segments is not necessarily comparable with BB&T’s consolidated results or with similar information presented by any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the
various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities.

The management accounting process uses various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the operating
segments. To determine financial performance for each segment, BB&T allocates capital, funding charges and credits, an economic provision for loan and lease losses, certain noninterest expenses and income tax provisions to each segment, as
applicable. Also, to promote revenue growth and provide a basis for employee incentives, certain revenues of Mortgage Banking, Trust Services, Agency Insurance and the Investment Banking and Brokerage segments are reflected in the individual segment
results and also allocated to the Banking Network. This double counting of revenue is reflected in intersegment noninterest revenues and eliminated to arrive at consolidated results. Allocation methodologies are subject to periodic adjustment as the
internal management accounting system is revised and business or product lines within the segments change. Also, because the development and application of these methodologies is a dynamic process, the financial results presented may be periodically
revised.

BB&T’s overall objective is to
maximize shareholder value by optimizing return on equity and managing risk. Allocations of capital and the economic provision for loan and lease losses are designed to address this objective. Capital is assigned to each segment on an economic
basis, using management’s assessment of the inherent risks associated with the segment. Economic capital allocations are made to cover the following risk categories: credit risk, funding risk, interest rate risk, option risk, basis risk, market
risk and operational risk. Each segment is evaluated based on a risk-adjusted return on capital. Capital assignments are not equivalent to regulatory capital guidelines and the total amount assigned to all segments typically varies from total
consolidated shareholders’ equity. All unallocated capital is retained in the Treasury segment.

The economic provision for loan and lease losses is also allocated to the relevant segments based on management’s assessment of the
segments’ risks as described above. Unlike the provision for loan and lease losses recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, the economic provision adjusts for the impact of expected credit losses over the effective lives
of the related loans and leases. Any unallocated provision for loan and lease losses is retained in the Corporate Office.

BB&T has implemented an extensive noninterest expense allocation process to support organizational profitability measurement. BB&T
allocates expenses to the reportable segments based on various methodologies, including the number of items processed, overall percentage of time spent, full-time equivalent employees assigned to functions, functional position surveys and
activity-based costing. A portion of corporate overhead expense is not allocated, but is retained in corporate accounts reflected as other expenses in the accompanying tables. Income taxes are allocated to the various segments using effective tax
rates.

BB&T utilizes a funds transfer
pricing (“FTP”) system to eliminate the effect of interest rate risk from the segments’ net interest income because such risk is centrally managed within the Treasury segment. The FTP system credits or charges the segments with the
estimated value or cost of the funds the segments create or use. The FTP system provides a funds credit for sources of funds and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. The net FTP credit or charge is reflected as net intersegment
interest income (expense) in the accompanying tables.

Banking Network

BB&T’s Banking Network serves individual and business clients by offering a variety of loan and deposit products and other financial services. The Banking Network is primarily responsible for serving client
relationships, and, therefore, is credited with revenue from the Mortgage Banking, Trust Services, Agency Insurance, Investment Banking and Brokerage and other segments, which is reflected in intersegment noninterest income.

Mortgage Banking

The Mortgage Banking segment retains and services mortgage
loans originated by the Banking Network as well as those purchased from various correspondent originators. Mortgage loan products include fixed- and adjustable-rate government and conventional loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or
refinancing owner-occupied properties. Fixed-rate mortgage loans are typically sold to government agencies with servicing rights retained by BB&T, while adjustable-rate loans are typically held in the portfolio. The Mortgage Banking segment
earns interest on loans held in the warehouse and portfolio, fee income from the origination and servicing of mortgage loans and recognizes gains or losses from the sale of mortgage loans. The Banking Network receives an interoffice credit for the
origination of loans and servicing rights, with the corresponding charge remaining in the Corporate Office, which is reflected as part of other net income in the accompanying tables reconciling segment results to consolidated results.

Trust Services

BB&T’s Trust Services segment provides personal
trust administration, estate planning, investment counseling, asset management, employee benefits services, and corporate trust services to individuals, corporations, institutions, foundations and government entities. The Banking Network receives an
interoffice credit for trust fees in the initial year the account is referred, with the corresponding charge remaining in the Corporate Office, which is reflected as part of other net income in the accompanying tables reconciling segment results to
consolidated results.

Agency Insurance

BB&T operates the 10

th

largest independent insurance agency network in the nation. BB&T Insurance Services provides property and casualty, life
and health insurance to businesses and individuals. It also provides small business and corporate products, such as workers compensation and professional liability, as well as provides surety coverage and title insurance. The Banking Network
receives credit for insurance commissions on referred accounts, with the corresponding charge retained in the Corporate Office. These revenues and expenses are reflected in the accompanying tables as intersegment noninterest income and expense.

Investment Banking and Brokerage

BB&T’s Investment Banking and
Brokerage segment offers clients investment alternatives, including discount brokerage services, fixed-rate and variable-rate annuities, and mutual funds through BB&T Investment Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Branch Bank. The Investment Banking
and Brokerage segment includes Scott & Stringfellow, Inc., a full-service brokerage and investment banking firm headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Scott & Stringfellow specializes in the origination, trading and distribution of
fixed-income securities and equity products in both the public and private capital markets. Scott & Stringfellow also has a public finance department that provides investment banking services, financial advisory services and municipal bond
financing to a variety of regional tax-exempt issuers. The Banking Network is credited for investment service revenues on referred accounts, with the corresponding charge retained in the Corporate Office, which is reflected as part of other net
income in the accompanying tables reconciling segment results to consolidated results. These revenues and expenses are reflected in the accompanying tables as intersegment noninterest income and expense.
