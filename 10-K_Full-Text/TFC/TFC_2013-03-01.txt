BB&T operates in markets that have a diverse employment
base and primarily consist of manufacturing, general services, agricultural, wholesale/retail trade, technology, government and
financial services. Management strongly believes that BB&T’s community bank approach to providing client service is a
competitive advantage that strengthens the Company’s ability to effectively provide financial products and services to businesses
and individuals in its markets. Furthermore, BB&T believes its current market area will support growth in assets and deposits
in the future.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive, and
dramatic change continues to occur in all aspects of BB&T’s business. The ability of nonbank financial entities to provide
services previously reserved for commercial banks has intensified competition. BB&T’s subsidiaries compete actively with
national, regional and local financial services providers,



including banks, thrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers, finance
companies and insurance companies. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues
to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives.
The industry continues to consolidate, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening
the franchises of acquirers. In addition, some financial services entities are still experiencing significant challenges as a result
of the economic crisis, resulting in bank and thrift failures. For additional information concerning markets, BB&T’s
competitive position and business strategies, and recent government interventions see “Market Area” above and “General
Business Development” below.

General Business Development

BB&T is a regional financial holding company. BB&T
has maintained a long-term focus on a strategy that includes expanding and diversifying the BB&T franchise in terms of revenues,
profitability and asset size. This strategy has encompassed both organic growth and acquisitions of complementary banks and financial
businesses. During the 1990s and through the mid-2000s, BB&T’s growth resulted largely from mergers and acquisitions
as the economics of business combinations were compelling. Since that time, BB&T has focused more on organic growth, but is
well positioned for strategic opportunities.

Merger and Acquisition Strategy

BB&T’s growth in business, profitability and market
share has historically been enhanced by strategic mergers and acquisitions. Management intends to remain disciplined and focused
with regard to future merger and acquisition opportunities. BB&T will continue to assess bank and thrift acquisitions subject
to market conditions, primarily within BB&T’s existing footprint, and will pursue economically advantageous acquisitions
of insurance agencies, specialized lending businesses, and fee income generating financial services businesses. BB&T’s
strategy is currently focused on meeting the following three acquisition criteria:

·

transactions must be strategically attractive – meaning that any bank acquisition should be in BB&T’s existing
footprint to allow for cost savings and economies of scale, or in contiguous states to provide market diversification;

·

any credit-related issues would need to be addressed; and

·

acquisitions must meet BB&T’s financial criteria.

Regulatory Considerations

The following discussion describes elements of an extensive
regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies and banks and specific information about BB&T. Regulation
of banks, BHCs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the DIF and the stability
of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. As described in more detail below, comprehensive
reform of the legislative and regulatory landscape occurred with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. Implementation of the
Dodd-Frank Act and related rulemaking activities continued in 2012. In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agencies,
BB&T is subject to various other laws, regulations, supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which
directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of BB&T and its ability to make distributions to shareholders.

BB&T’s earnings are affected by general economic
conditions, management policies, changes in state and federal laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities,
including those referred to in this section. Proposals to change the laws and regulations to which BB&T is subject are frequently
introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may
have on BB&T is impossible to determine with any certainty. The description herein summarizes the significant state and federal
laws to which BB&T currently is subject. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions are described in this section, such
descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions.

Financial Regulatory Reform

The past two years have resulted in a significant increase
in regulation and regulatory oversight for U.S. financial services firms, primarily resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank
Act is extensive, complicated and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, representing
a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous
and far-reaching changes that affect financial companies, including banks and BHCs such as BB&T, by, among other things:



·

Requiring regulation and oversight of large, systemically important financial institutions by establishing an interagency council
on systemic risk and implementation of heightened prudential standards and regulation by the FRB for systemically important financial
institutions (including nonbank financial companies), as well as the implementation of the FDIC resolution procedures for liquidation of large financial companies to avoid market disruption;

·

applying the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most BHCs,
savings and loan holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies;

·

limiting the FRB’s emergency authority to lend to nondepository institutions to facilities with broad-based eligibility,
and authorizing the FDIC to establish an emergency financial stabilization fund for solvent depository institutions and their holding
companies, subject to the approval of Congress, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the FRB;

·

centralizing responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new independent agency, the CFPB, with responsibility
for implementing, enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws;

·

creating regimes for regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and non-admitted property and casualty insurers and reinsurers;

·

requiring any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be “reasonable” and proportional to the
cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction, with new regulations that establish such fee standards, eliminate exclusivity
arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions and limit restrictions on merchant discounting for use of
certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards;

·

transferring the functions of the OTS relating to federal savings associations, including rulemaking authority, to the OCC;

·

implementing regulation of hedge fund and private equity advisers by requiring such advisers to register with the SEC;

·

providing for the implementation of certain corporate governance provisions for all public companies concerning executive compensation;

·

increasing the FDIC’s deposit insurance limits permanently to $250,000 for non-transaction accounts and changing the
assessment base as well as increasing the reserve ratio for the DIF to ensure the future strength of the DIF; and

·

reforming regulation of credit rating agencies.

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject
to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. BB&T will continue to evaluate the
impact of any new regulations so promulgated, including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products
or disclosures required by the CFPB and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others.

As a BHC and a financial holding company under federal law,
BB&T is subject to regulation under the BHCA and the examination and reporting requirements of the FRB. Branch Bank, a state-chartered
commercial bank, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks and the FDIC.

State and federal law govern the activities in which Branch
Bank engages, the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer
and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations. Branch Bank also is affected by the actions of the FRB as it attempts
to control the monetary supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.

In addition to federal and state banking laws and regulations,
BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in securities underwriting, dealing, brokerage,
investment advisory and insurance activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, and supervision and
examination by other state and federal regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities, including the SEC, FINRA, NYSE, and
various state insurance and securities regulators.

Financial Holding Company Regulation

Under current federal law, a BHC, such as BB&T, may elect
to become a financial holding company, which allows the holding company to offer customers virtually any type of service that is
financial in nature or incidental thereto, including



banking and activities closely related thereto, securities underwriting, insurance
(both underwriting and agency) and merchant banking. In order to qualify and maintain its status as a financial holding company,
a financial holding company and all of its affiliated depository institutions must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and have
at least a satisfactory CRA rating. If the FRB determines that a financial holding company is not well-capitalized or well-managed,
the company has a period of time to comply, but during the period of noncompliance,
the FRB can place any limitations on the financial holding company that it believes to be appropriate. Furthermore, if the FRB
determines that a financial holding company has not maintained a satisfactory CRA rating, the company will not be able to commence
any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities, although the company will still be allowed to
engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting merchant banking activities.
BB&T is a financial holding company and currently satisfies the requirements to maintain its status as a financial holding
company.

Most of the financial activities that are permissible for
financial holding companies also are permissible for a bank’s “financial subsidiary,” except for insurance underwriting,
insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investments and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted
in a financial holding company. In order for permissible financial activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a bank,
federal law requires the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well-capitalized and well-managed; the aggregate consolidated
assets of all of that bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or
$50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest national banks,
it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.

Current federal law also establishes a system of functional
regulation under which the FRB is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, but BHC affiliates are principally regulated by functional regulators
such as the FDIC for state nonmember bank affiliates, the OCC for thrifts, the SEC for securities affiliates and state insurance
regulators for insurance affiliates. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may
be conducted in the bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes
of functional regulation. Although states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, states
may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable areas.

The Dodd-Frank Act establishes additional regulation for
BHCs, which will generally apply to BB&T. The Council is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to monitor emerging risks to financial
stability, recommend heightened prudential standards for large, interconnected financial companies and require certain nonbank
financial companies to be supervised by the FRB if their activities are determined to pose a risk to financial stability.

The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes new prudential regulation
on depository institutions and their holding companies. The law imposes new, more stringent standards and requirements with respect
to (1) bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers, (2) financial holding companies engaged in “financial activities,”
(3) affiliate transactions and (4) proprietary trading, among other provisions.

Enhanced Supervision Standards for Systemically
Important Financial Institutions

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to establish enhanced
supervision and prudential standards applicable to large, interconnected financial institutions, including BHCs like BB&T,
with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (often referred to as systemically important financial institutions). The
Council may make recommendations to the FRB on those standards. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the requirements applicable to
systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial companies.

Resolution Planning

In September 2011, the FDIC adopted rules implementing “living
will” requirements for systemically important financial institutions such as BB&T. These requirements impose obligations
on systemically important financial institutions to file, maintain and update plans for an institution’s rapid and orderly
resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure. Both the FRB and the FDIC must review and approve BB&T’s
living will and are authorized to impose restrictions on BB&T’s growth and activities or operations if deemed necessary.
BB&T’s initial plans are expected to be submitted to the FRB and the FDIC in December 2013. Following the initial submission,
BB&T is required to submit annual resolution plans by July 1 of each subsequent year.

CCAR and Stress Test Requirements

In November 2011, the FRB published a final rule requiring
BHCs such as BB&T with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets to submit annual capital plans based on pre-defined
stress scenarios. Capital plans are required to be submitted on an annual basis. Such BHCs will also be required to collect and
report certain related data on a quarterly basis



to allow the FRB to monitor the companies’ progress against their annual
capital plans. Covered BHCs, including BB&T, may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan
that has been reviewed by the FRB and as to which the FRB has not objected. The rules also require, among other things, that a
covered BHC may not make a capital distribution unless, after giving effect to the distribution, it will meet all minimum regulatory
capital ratios and have a ratio of Basel I Tier 1 common capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 5%. BB&T submitted its
capital plan to the FRB for 2012 and thereafter received notice that the FRB had no objections
to the capital plan. BB&T submitted its 2013 capital plan for review in January 2013.

In addition to the CCAR process, the Dodd-Frank Act requires
the FRB to conduct an annual supervisory stress test for BHCs such as BB&T with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets
and to conduct semi-annual company-run stress tests. In October 2012, the FRB adopted final stress testing rules for covered BHCs
that describe the types of supervisory scenarios that may be provided in connection with the annual CCAR process, and require that
BB&T (as well as other covered BHCs) conduct a separate mid-year stress test, file the results of such test with the FRB in
early July and publicly disclose details of the scenario and the impact on BHC capital by the end of September of each year. These
stress test rules became effective for BB&T in November 2012.

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC to conduct an annual
supervisory stress test for FDIC-insured state nonmember banks such as Branch Bank with $50 billion or more of total consolidated
assets and requires such institutions to conduct annual company-run stress tests. The FDIC adopted final annual stress testing
rules in October 2012.

OCC

Prior to January 1, 2013, BB&T FSB, as a federally chartered
thrift, was subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. Effective January 1, 2013, BB&T FSB was merged into
Branch Bank and no longer exists as a separate entity and, therefore, is no longer regulated by the OCC.

Acquisitions

BB&T complies with numerous laws related to its acquisition
activity. Under the BHCA, a BHC may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares
or substantially all of the assets of any BHC or bank or merge or consolidate with another BHC without the prior approval of the
FRB. Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and BHCs without geographic limitation. Furthermore, a bank
headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, subject to any state requirement
that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years; and subject
to certain deposit market-share limitations. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction,
the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could
have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. These regulatory considerations are applicable to
privately negotiated acquisition transactions.

Other Safety and Soundness Regulations

The FRB has enforcement powers over BHCs and their nonbanking
subsidiaries. The FRB has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations
of law, rule, regulation, administrative order or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through
the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions.

There also are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed
on BHCs and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential
loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insurance fund in the event the depository institution
is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. For example, under requirements of the FRB with respect to BHC operations,
a BHC is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit financial
resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise. In addition, the “cross-guarantee”
provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered
or reasonably anticipated by the DIF as a result of the insolvency of commonly controlled insured depository institutions or for
any assistance provided by the FDIC to commonly controlled insured depository institutions in danger of failure. The FDIC may decline
to enforce the cross-guarantee provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interests of the DIF. The FDIC’s claim
for reimbursement under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution
or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and nonaffiliated holders of subordinated
debt of the commonly controlled insured depository institution.



Federal and state banking regulators also have broad enforcement
powers over Branch Bank, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a conservator
(with the approval of the Governor in the case of a North Carolina state bank) in order to conserve the assets of any such institution
for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. The North Carolina Commissioner of Banks also has the authority to take possession
of a North Carolina state bank in certain circumstances, including, among other things, when it appears that such bank has violated
its charter or any applicable laws, is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, is in an unsafe or unsound
condition to transact its business or has an impairment of its capital stock.

Payment of Dividends; Capital Requirements

The Parent Company is a legal entity separate and distinct
from Branch Bank and its subsidiaries. The majority of the Parent Company’s revenue is from dividends paid by Branch Bank.
Branch Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, BB&T and Branch
Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital
at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations summarized
elsewhere in this section. Federal banking regulators have indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends
only if (1) the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully
fund the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital
needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. BB&T’s 2013 capital actions will depend on the FRB’s review
of BB&T’s 2013 capital plan.

North Carolina law states that, provided a bank does not
make distributions that reduce its capital below its applicable required capital, the board of directors of a bank chartered under
the laws of North Carolina may declare such distributions as the directors deem proper.

The FRB and the FDIC have issued substantially similar risk-based
and leverage capital guidelines applicable to banking organizations they supervise, including BHCs and banks. Under the current
risk-based capital requirements, BB&T and Branch Bank are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital
to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) of 8%. At least half
of the total capital must be composed of common shareholders’ equity excluding the over or underfunded status of postretirement
benefit obligations, unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale, unrealized gains on equity securities available
for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges, net of deferred income taxes; plus certain mandatorily redeemable
capital securities; less nonqualifying intangible assets net of applicable deferred income taxes and certain nonfinancial equity
investments. This is called “Tier 1 capital.” The remainder may consist of qualifying subordinated debt, qualifying
preferred stock and a limited amount of the ACL. This is called “Tier 2 capital.” Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital
combined are referred to as total regulatory capital.

The FRB requires BHCs that engage in trading activities to
adjust their risk-based capital ratios to take into consideration market risks that may result from movements in market prices
of covered trading positions in trading accounts, or from foreign exchange or commodity positions, whether or not in trading accounts,
including changes in interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Any capital required to be maintained
under these provisions may consist of “Tier 3 capital” consisting of forms of short-term subordinated debt.

The FRB and the FDIC also have established minimum leverage
capital requirements for banking organizations. These requirements provide that banking organizations that meet certain criteria,
including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have received the highest
regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 3%. Institutions not meeting
these criteria, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial or operational weaknesses, are expected to maintain a minimum
Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets ratio at least 100 basis points above that stated minimum. BHCs experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels
without significant reliance on intangible assets. The FRB also continues to consider a “tangible Tier 1 capital leverage
ratio” (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new
activity.

In addition, the FRB and the FDIC have adopted risk-based
capital standards that explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non-traditional activities,
as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks, as important factors to be taken into account by each agency in
assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The capital guidelines also provide that an institution’s exposure
to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating
a banking organization’s capital adequacy. The agencies also require banks and BHCs to adjust their regulatory capital to
take into consideration the risk associated with certain recourse obligations, direct credit subsidies, residual interest and other
positions in securitized transactions that expose banking organizations to credit risk.



As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, provisions were added that
require federal banking agencies to develop capital requirements, which are discussed in more detail below. The effect of these
capital rules will disallow trust preferred securities from inclusion as Tier 1 capital at the holding company level for entities
with greater than $15 billion in assets with a three-year phase-in period beginning on January 1, 2013.

Information related to certain capital ratios is shown in
the following table.

The federal banking agencies, including the FRB and the FDIC,
are required to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions and their BHCs that do not meet
minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five capital categories for insured depository institutions for this purpose:
“well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized”
and “critically undercapitalized.” To be considered “well-capitalized” under these standards, an institution
must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater; a leverage
capital ratio of 5% or greater; and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital
level for any capital measure.

Federal law also requires the bank regulatory agencies to
implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within
the five capital categories, with progressively more severe restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions according
to the category in which an institution is placed. Failure to meet capital requirements also may cause an institution to be directed
to raise additional capital. Federal law also mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards generally relating
to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and authorizes administrative action against an institution
that fails to meet such standards.

In addition to the “prompt corrective action”
directives, failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including
additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain
conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver.

Basel III

In 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervisors
of the BCBS, the oversight body of the Basel Committee, published Basel III. Under these standards, when fully phased in, banking
institutions will be required to maintain heightened Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios, as well as
maintaining a “capital conservation buffer.” As proposed, Basel III provides for the Tier 1 common equity and Tier
1 capital ratio requirements to be phased in incrementally between January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2015; the deductions from common
equity made in calculating Tier 1 common equity (for example, for mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets and investments
in unconsolidated financial institutions) to be phased in incrementally over a four-year period commencing on January 1, 2014;
and the capital conservation buffer to be phased in incrementally between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. The BCBS also announced
that a “countercyclical buffer” of 0% to 2.5% of common equity or other fully loss-absorbing capital “will be
implemented according to national circumstances” as an “extension” of the conservation buffer. The final package
of Basel III reforms were approved by the G20 leaders in November 2010 and are subject to individual adoption by member nations,
including the United States.

U.S. Implementation of Basel III

In June 2012, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC issued a joint
release announcing three separate NPRs seeking comment on proposed rules that would revise and replace their current capital
rules in a manner consistent with relevant provisions of the Dodd-



Frank Act as well as the implementation of Basel III. The
comment period on these NPRs ended on October 22, 2012. Also in June 2012, these agencies announced the finalization of their
market risk capital rule proposed in 2011.

One NPR proposes the majority of the revisions to international
capital standards in Basel III, including a more restrictive definition of regulatory capital, higher minimum regulatory capital
requirements, and the imposition of capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers. It also proposes limitations on
certain distributions and discretionary bonuses as well as revisions to the agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations.
Another NPR proposes new methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets, such as by expanding the number and type of exposure
categories, providing a more comprehensive recognition of collateral and guarantees, and introducing or applying more risk-sensitive
treatment for certain exposures (including certain high-volatility CRE, corporate, equity, foreign, securitization, derivative,
residential mortgage, and 90 day or more past due exposures). It also proposes detailed qualitative and quantitative public disclosure
requirements relating to capital adequacy. The final NPR proposes to revise the current advanced approaches risk-based capital
rule to incorporate certain aspects of Basel III as well as certain other revisions to the Basel capital framework published by
the BCBS between 2009 and 2011. While BB&T and Branch Bank would be subject to the first two NPRs, they would not be subject
to the third NPR.

While Basel III is intended to be implemented on a global
basis beginning January 1, 2013, to be fully-phased in by January 1, 2019, on November 9, 2012 the FRB, FDIC, and OCC issued a
joint release announcing that the implementation of the proposed rules under Basel III in the U.S. would be delayed.

New Minimum Capital Requirements

While uncertainty exists regarding the timing for adoption
of the foregoing revised capital standards, if such capital standards are adopted in their current form, we estimate these standards
would have a negligible impact on our ability to comply with the revised regulatory capital ratios based on our current understanding
of the revisions to capital qualification. Once adopted, banking organizations such as BB&T would be required to meet the following
minimum capital and leverage ratios – 3.5% common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets, 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets and 4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets minus amounts deducted
from Tier 1 capital. The implementation of a capital conservation buffer, effectively raising the minimum capital requirements,
will begin on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of common equity to risk-weighted assets and be phased-in over a four-year period (increasing
by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).

When fully phased-in, the Basel III capital framework will
require BB&T and Branch Bank to maintain: (1) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at
least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer; (2) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 6%, plus
the 2.5% capital conservation buffer; (3) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets
of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer; and (4) a minimum leverage capital ratio of 4%, calculated as the
ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital. Thus, when the capital conservation
buffer is fully phased-in, minimum ratios will effectively be: 7% for Tier 1 common equity, 8.5% for Tier 1 capital, and 10.5%
for total capital, with a 4% leverage ratio.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Branch Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the
FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was
amended pursuant to the Reform Act and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates
for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. Effective April 1, 2011,
the FDIC implemented a revised assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution
poses to the DIF. The new assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank
Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. The FDIC
has published guidelines under the Reform Act on the adjustment of assessment rates for certain institutions. Under the current
system, premiums are assessed quarterly.

Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations

In connection with its lending and leasing activities, Branch
Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the
economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending
Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts.



CFPB

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, the CFPB, which was granted broad rulemaking,
supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above,
fair lending laws and certain other statutes.  The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to
depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as
debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies.  The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices
in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain
minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a
“qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB.  The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws
and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys
general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.

The CFPB has concentrated much of its rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage-related topics required
under the Dodd-Frank Act, including mortgage origination disclosures, minimum underwriting standards and ability to repay, high-cost
mortgage lending, and servicing practices.  On August 9, 2012, the CFPB issued three NPRs covering loan origination and servicing
requirements, which were finalized in January 2013, along with other rules on mortgages.  The ability to repay and qualified
mortgage standards rules, as well as the mortgage servicing rules, are scheduled to become effective in January 2014.  The
escrow and loan originator compensation rules are scheduled to become effective in June 2013.  A final rule integrating disclosures
required by the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act is expected later this year.  BB&T
continues to analyze the impact that such rules may have on its business.

Interchange Fees

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB adopted rules
effective October 1, 2011, establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to
electronic debit transactions are “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by issuers for such transactions.
Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are charges that merchants pay to BB&T and other credit card companies and card-issuing
banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Under the final rules, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer
may receive for an electronic debit transaction will be the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the
value of the transaction. An additional 1 cent per transaction fraud prevention adjustment is available to those issuers that comply
with certain standards outlined by the FRB.

Privacy

Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy
protection provisions, including substantial customer privacy protections provided under the Financial Services Modernization Act
of 1999 (commonly known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act). Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers,
at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding
the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain
limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution
discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such
disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information
of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.

CRA

The CRA requires Branch Bank’s primary federal bank
regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank,
including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,”
“Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” This assessment is reviewed
for any bank that applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository
institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. The CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a financial holding company, such
as BB&T, also is assessed by the FRB in connection with any acquisition or merger application.

Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation

The FRB and FDIC have enacted consumer protection regulations
related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions. In 2009, the FRB amended its Regulation E to
prohibit financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit
card transactions, unless a consumer



consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Financial
institutions must also provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial
institution’s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service and the consumer’s choices. In addition,
FDIC-supervised institutions must monitor overdraft payment programs for “excessive or chronic” customer use and undertake
“meaningful and effective” follow-up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times during
a rolling 12-month period. Financial institutions must also impose daily limits on overdraft charges, review and modify check-clearing
procedures, prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and ensure board and management
oversight regarding overdraft payment programs.

Patriot Act

The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering
measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. The Patriot Act
includes the IMLAFA, which requires such financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism and grants the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority to establish
regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations. In addition, the Patriot
Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money
laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions. The U.S. Treasury has issued a number of regulations
to implement the Patriot Act, which impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures
and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The obligations of financial
institutions under the Patriot Act have increased and may continue to increase. The increase in obligations of financial
institutions has resulted in increased costs for BB&T, which may continue to rise, and also may subject BB&T to
additional liability.

Other Regulatory Matters

BB&T is subject to numerous examinations by federal and
state banking regulators, as well as the SEC, the FINRA, the NYSE, various taxing authorities and various state insurance and securities
regulators. BB&T has periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including
state insurance commissions and state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning their
business and accounting practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.

Employees

At December 31, 2012, BB&T had approximately 34,000 full-time
equivalent employees compared to approximately 31,800 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2011.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS

The following discussion
sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect BB&T’s financial condition and operations.
Other factors that could affect the Company’s financial condition and operations are discussed in the “Forward-Looking
Statements” section above. However, there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known, and factors besides
those discussed below, or elsewhere in this or other reports that BB&T filed or furnished with the SEC, that also could adversely
affect the Company.

Changes in national, regional and local economic conditions
and deterioration in the geographic and financial markets in which BB&T operates could lead to higher loan charge-offs and
reduce BB&T’s net income and growth.

BB&T’s business
is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national, regional and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable,
cannot be controlled, and may have a material adverse impact on BB&T’s operations and

f

inancial
condition even if other favorable events occur. BB&T’s banking operations are locally oriented and community-based.
Accordingly, BB&T expects to continue to be dependent upon local business conditions as well as conditions in the local residential
and commercial real estate markets it serves. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or increases
in interest rates, as well as other factors, could weaken the economies of the communities BB&T serves. Weakness in BB&T’s
market area could depress its earnings and consequently its financial condition because:

·

customers may not want or need BB&T’s products or services;

·

borrowers may not be able or willing to repay their loans;

·

the value of the collateral securing loans to borrowers may decline; and

·

the quality of BB&T’s loan portfolio may decline.

Any of the latter three
scenarios could require BB&T to charge off a higher percentage of loans and/or increase provisions for credit losses, which
would reduce BB&T’s net income. For example, while the credit deterioration that BB&T experienced from 2007 through
2010 has improved considerably in the last two years, the challenges in the residential real estate markets still present credit
deterioration risks for BB&T in light of the slow pace of general economic recovery. Any further credit deterioration, combined
with flat to declining real estate values, would result in increased loan charge-offs and higher provisions for credit losses,
which may negatively impact BB&T’s net income.

Although the United States
economy has shown modest improvement recently, economic conditions continue to pose a risk to financial services firms such as
BB&T. The economic recovery, although continuing, proceeded at a slower pace in 2012 than previously anticipated. Job growth
has not yet been sufficient to significantly reduce high unemployment in the United States. There continues to be concern regarding
the possibility of a return to recessionary conditions, as well as increased turmoil or volatility in the financial system. BB&T
is part of the financial system and a systemic lack of available credit, a lack of confidence in the financial sector, continued
volatility in the financial markets and/or reduced business activity could materially adversely affect BB&T’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Further downgrades of U.S. government securities by one
or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on BB&T’s operations, earnings and financial
condition.

In August 2011, the S&P credit rating agency lowered
its long term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. from AAA to AA+, while maintaining a negative outlook. The downgrade reflected
S&P’s view that an August 2011 agreement of U.S. lawmakers regarding the debt ceiling fell short of what would be necessary
to stabilize the U.S. government’s medium term debt dynamics. The three other major credit rating agencies did not downgrade
their previously issued U.S. sovereign credit ratings. The current uncertainty over U.S. fiscal policy, and the resulting tax increases
and potential spending cuts in the U.S. in 2013 could lead to future or further downgrades of the U.S. sovereign credit rating
by one or more of the major credit rating agencies. A possible future downgrade of the federal government’s credit rating
by one or more of the other major ratings agencies could create uncertainty in the U.S. and global financial markets and cause
other events which, directly or indirectly, may adversely affect BB&T’s operations, earnings and financial condition.
For example, BB&T’s securities portfolio consists largely of RMBS issued by GSEs, such as FHLMC and FNMA. Among other
things, a further downgrade in the U.S. government’s credit rating could adversely impact the value of these securities and
may trigger requirements that the Company post additional collateral for trades relative to these securities.



Turmoil and volatility in global financial markets
could have a material adverse effect on BB&T’s operations, earnings and financial condition.

The negative impact on economic conditions and global markets
from the EU sovereign debt matters could adversely affect BB&T’s business, financial condition and liquidity. Concerns
about the EU sovereign debt have caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally, and continued uncertainties
loom over the outcome of the EU’s financial support programs and the possibility that other EU member states may experience
similar financial troubles.

The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies,
including the FRB, have a significant impact on market interest rates, and our business and financial performance is impacted significantly
by such interest rates.

BB&T’s businesses and earnings are affected by
the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the U.S., non-U.S. governments and international agencies.
The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. The federal policies determine in large part the cost of funds for
lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments. The market impact from such policies can also materially
decrease the value of certain of BB&T’s financial assets, most notably debt securities. Changes in the federal policies
are beyond BB&T’s control and, consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations
is difficult to predict.

Weakness in the secondary residential mortgage loan markets
could reduce BB&T’s net income and profitability.

Significant ongoing disruption in the secondary market for
residential mortgage loans has limited the market for, and liquidity of, most mortgage loans other than conforming FNMA, FHLMC
and GNMA loans. The effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges, combined with the ongoing correction in residential real estate
market prices and reduced levels of home sales has resulted in reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the
value of collateral securing mortgage loans held and mortgage loan originations. Continued declines in real estate values and home
sales volumes within BB&T’s banking footprint, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses, or other
factors, could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future
periods, which would adversely affect BB&T’s financial condition and results of operations.

BB&T’s liquidity could be impaired by an inability
to access the capital markets, an unforeseen outflow of cash or a reduction in the credit ratings for BB&T or its subsidiaries.

Liquidity is essential to BB&T’s businesses. Capital
and credit markets continue to demonstrate volatility and disruption, despite modest improvements in the general economy during
the last two years, producing in some cases downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard
to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. If these levels of market disruption and volatility continue, worsen or
abate and then arise at a later date, BB&T’s ability to access capital could be materially impaired. Additionally, other
factors outside of BB&T’s control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties,
could impair BB&T’s ability to access capital markets or create an unforeseen outflow of cash or deposits. BB&T’s
inability to access the capital markets could constrain its ability to make new loans, to meet its existing lending commitments
and ultimately jeopardize its overall liquidity and capitalization.

BB&T’s credit ratings are also important to its
liquidity. Rating agencies regularly evaluate BB&T and its subsidiaries, and their ratings are based on a number of factors,
including the financial strength of BB&T and its subsidiaries, as well as factors not entirely within BB&T’s control,
including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of ongoing difficulties in the financial services
industry and the housing and financial markets, as well as the soft economic recovery in general, there can be no assurance that
BB&T will maintain its current ratings. A reduction in BB&T’s credit ratings could adversely affect BB&T’s
liquidity and competitive position, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets or trigger unfavorable
contractual obligations.

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely
affect BB&T.

Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result
of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BB&T has exposure to many different industries and counterparties,
and BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry,
including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many
of these transactions expose BB&T to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, BB&T’s
credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or
derivative exposure. These types of losses could materially and adversely affect BB&T’s results of operations or financial
condition.



Changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect
on BB&T’s profitability.

BB&T’s earnings and financial condition are largely
dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid
on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads, could adversely affect BB&T’s earnings and financial
condition. BB&T cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions,
competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect interest income
and interest expense. As discussed in “Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Market Risk (Other than Trading),”
BB&T has ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates. However,
changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on BB&T’s profitability. For example, high interest rates
could adversely affect BB&T’s mortgage banking business because higher interest rates could cause customers to apply
for fewer mortgage refinancings or purchase mortgages. While BB&T actively manages against these risks, if BB&T’s
assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly worse than we anticipate, the
Company’s risk mitigation techniques may be insufficient.

Changes in banking laws could have a material adverse
effect on BB&T.

BB&T is extensively regulated under federal and
state banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance
funds and the banking system as a whole. In addition, BB&T is subject to changes in federal and state laws as well as
changes in banking and credit regulations, and governmental economic and monetary policies. Any of these changes could
adversely and materially affect BB&T. The current regulatory environment for financial institutions entails significant
potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs, including those related to consumer credit, with a focus
on mortgage lending. For example, the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 represented a significant overhaul of many
aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, and the implementation of and rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank
Act during 2012 and in the future could result in higher compliance costs and otherwise materially adversely affect
BB&T’s business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Regulatory Considerations” and the
immediately following risk factors for additional information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act and its potential impact upon
BB&T and its subsidiaries.

Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers
to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher
insurance premiums and limitations on BB&T’s activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and
profitability.

The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, and
its related rulemaking activities, may result in lower revenues, higher costs and ratings downgrades. In addition, failure to meet
the FRB’s capital planning and adequacy requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, may limit our ability to pay dividends, enter
into acquisitions and repurchase our common stock.

The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law in July 2010, represents
a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic
risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits,
and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. BB&T, under Dodd-Frank, is deemed to be a “systemically important”
institution. During 2012, federal agencies continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of these provisions remain subject
to further rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators, such as the Council, which will regulate
the systemic risk of the financial system. Due to BB&T’s size, it will be subject to additional regulations such as the
“living will” requirements relating to the rapid and orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions
in the event of material financial distress or failure. BB&T cannot predict the additional effects that compliance with the
Dodd-Frank Act or any regulations will have on BB&T’s businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities.
Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect BB&T’s business, financial condition
or results of operations. See “Regulatory Considerations” for additional information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act and
its impact upon BB&T.

In addition, BB&T has been subject to assessment by the
FRB as part of the CCAR program. CCAR is an annual exercise by the FRB to ensure that institutions have forward-looking capital
planning processes that account for their risks and sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and
financial stress. BB&T cannot be certain that the FRB will have no objections to BB&T’s future capital plans submitted
through the CCAR program. Failure by BB&T to pass the CCAR review could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, enter
into acquisitions and repurchase our common stock.



Consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft
payment programs could adversely affect BB&T’s business operations, net income and profitability.

BB&T has implemented changes to its
business practices relating to overdraft payment programs in order to comply with the regulations enacted by the FRB in July
2010 and the FDIC in July 2011 relating to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions. See
“Regulatory Considerations—Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation.”

Prior to enactment of these consumer protection regulations,
Branch Bank’s overdraft and insufficient funds fees represented a significant amount of non-interest fees collected by Branch
Bank. Since taking effect, the fees received by Branch Bank for automated overdraft payment services have decreased,
thereby adversely impacting BB&T’s non-interest income. For 2010, overdraft and insufficient fund fees totaled $427 million. For 2012, the first full fiscal year for which the regulations took effect, overdraft
and insufficient fund fees totaled $318 million. Complying with these regulations has resulted in increased operational costs for
BB&T and Branch Bank, which may continue to rise. In addition, BB&T may be placed at a competitive disadvantage to the
extent that its competitors are not subject to the FDIC’s automated overdraft payment program regulations. The actual impact
of these regulations in future periods could vary due to a variety of factors, including changes in customer behavior, economic
conditions and other factors, which could adversely affect BB&T’s business operations, net income and profitability.

BB&T may be subject to more stringent capital requirements,
which could diminish its ability to pay dividends or require BB&T to reduce its operations.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal banking agencies to
establish more stringent risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits applicable to banks and BHCs. Under the legislation,
federal banking agencies are required to develop capital requirements that address systemically risky activities. The effect of
these capital rules will disallow trust preferred securities from qualifying as Tier 1 capital at the holding company level for
entities with greater than $15 billion in assets, with a three-year phase-in period. On June 12, 2012, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC
issued a joint release announcing three separate notices of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on proposed rules that would revise
and replace their current capital rules in a manner consistent both with relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as
the implementation of Basel III. Once adopted and fully phased in, banking organizations such as BB&T would be required to
meet enhanced minimum capital and leverage ratios. These requirements, and any other new regulations, including those that have
been proposed but not yet implemented as a result of the requirements established by the BCBS, could adversely affect BB&T’s
ability to pay dividends, or could require BB&T to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including ways that may adversely
affect its results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the costs associated with complying with more stringent
capital requirements, such as the requirement to formulate and submit capital plans based on pre-defined stress scenarios on an
annual basis, could have a material adverse effect on BB&T. See “Regulatory Considerations” for additional information
regarding the capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III.

BB&T may experience significant competition in its
market area, which may reduce its customer base or cause it to lower prices for its products and services in order to maintain
market share.

There is intense competition among commercial banks in BB&T’s
market area. In addition, BB&T competes with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations,
credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, the
mutual funds industry, full-service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulations
than BB&T is with respect to the products and services they provide. BB&T’s success depends, in part, on its ability
to adapt its products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services
at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce BB&T’s NIM and revenues from its fee-based products and services.

In addition, the adoption of new technologies by competitors,
including internet banking services, mobile phone applications and advanced ATM functionality could require BB&T to make substantial
expenditures to modify or adapt its existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in BB&T’s
business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. BB&T may not be successful
in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, anticipating or reacting to
consumers’ changing technological preferences or developing and maintaining loyal customers.

Some of BB&T’s larger competitors, including certain
national banks that have a significant presence in BB&T’s market area, may have greater capital and resources than BB&T,
may have higher lending limits and may offer products and services not offered by BB&T. Any potential adverse reactions to
BB&T’s financial condition or status in the marketplace, as compared to its competitors, could limit BB&T’s
ability to attract and retain customers and to compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers
or to effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on BB&T’s financial condition and results
of operations.



BB&T also experiences competition from a variety of institutions
outside of its market area. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the Internet and may thus be able to realize
certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer who can
pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This “disintermediation” could result in the loss
of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer
spending and saving habits could adversely affect BB&T’s operations, and the Company may be unable to develop competitive
new products and services in response to these changes on a timely basis or at all.

Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect
on BB&T.

The occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes,
tropical storms, tornados, and other large scale catastrophes could adversely affect BB&T’s consolidated financial condition
or results of operations. BB&T has operations and customers along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts as well as other parts of the
southeastern United States, which could be adversely impacted by hurricanes and other severe weather in those regions. Unpredictable
natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on BB&T in that such events could materially disrupt its operations
or the ability or willingness of its customers to access the financial services offered by BB&T. BB&T’s property
and casualty insurance operations also expose it to claims arising out of catastrophes. The incidence and severity of catastrophes
are inherently unpredictable. Although BB&T carries insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain catastrophic events, these
events could nevertheless reduce BB&T’s earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for any fiscal quarter
or year and have a material adverse effect on BB&T’s financial condition and/or results of operations.

BB&T faces significant operational risks related to
its activities, which could expose it to negative publicity, litigation and/or regulatory action.

BB&T is exposed to many types of risks, including operational,
reputational, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders (including identity and information
theft), unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting
from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from BB&T’s actual
or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, activities
related to asset sales and balance sheet management and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations
in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect BB&T’s ability to attract and keep customers
and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.

Because the nature of the financial services business involves
a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified.
BB&T’s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase
the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to
detect. BB&T also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond
its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service
to customers and to financial loss or liability. BB&T is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable
to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective
employees as is BB&T) and to the risk that BB&T’s (or its vendors’) business continuity and data security systems
prove to be inadequate.

BB&T relies on other companies to provide certain
key components of its business infrastructure.

Third party vendors provide certain key components of BB&T’s
business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and mutual fund distribution. While BB&T has selected
these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their operations. Any failure by these third parties to perform or provide
agreed upon goods and services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect BB&T’s ability
to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise to conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could
also entail significant delay and expense.

Significant litigation could have a material adverse effect
on BB&T.

BB&T faces legal risks in its business, and the volume
of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain
high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against BB&T may have material adverse financial effects
or cause significant reputational harm to BB&T, which in turn could seriously harm BB&T’s business prospects.



BB&T faces systems failure risks as well as cyber-security
risks, including “denial of service,” “hacking” and “identity theft” that could adversely affect
BB&T’s business and financial performance or reputation.

The computer systems and network infrastructure BB&T
and its third-party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. BB&T’s operations are dependent
upon its ability to protect computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss or telecommunication failure. Any damage or
failure that causes an interruption in BB&T’s operations could adversely affect its business and financial results.

In addition, BB&T’s computer systems and network
infrastructure are subject to security risks, and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking,
terrorist activities or identity theft. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services
institutions, including BB&T. None of these events resulted in a breach of BB&T’s client data or account information;
however, the performance of BB&T’s website, www.bbt.com, was adversely affected and in some instances customers were
prevented from accessing BB&T’s website. We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. While events to date
primarily resulted in inconvenience, future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks,
in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and BB&T may not be able to anticipate
or prevent all such attacks. BB&T may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable
for any security breach or loss.

Differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations
may adversely impact BB&T’s financial statements.

Local, state or federal tax authorities may interpret
tax laws and regulations differently than BB&T and challenge tax positions that BB&T has taken on its tax returns.
This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these
items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest or penalties that could have a
material adverse effect on BB&T’s results. For example, as discussed in Note 13 “Income Taxes” in the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” in February 2010, BB&T received an IRS statutory notice of
deficiency for tax years 2002-2007 asserting a liability for taxes, penalties and interest of approximately $892
million related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits and other deductions claimed by a subsidiary in connection with a
financing transaction.  BB&T paid the disputed tax,
penalties and interest in March 2010 and filed a lawsuit seeking a refund in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The Court has
scheduled the trial to begin March 4, 2013. Potential developments in BB&T’s litigation or in similar cases
could adversely affect BB&T’s financial position or results of operations.

BB&T may not be able to complete future acquisitions.

BB&T must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions
before it can complete an acquisition of another bank or BHC, including federal and/or state regulatory approvals. In determining
whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition
on competition, financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence,
experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities
to be served, including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring
institution in combating money laundering activities and protests from various stakeholders of both BB&T and its acquisition
partner. Also, under the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. regulators must now take systemic risk into account when evaluating whether to approve
a potential acquisition transaction involving a large financial institution like BB&T. BB&T cannot be certain when or if,
or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. In specific cases, BB&T may be required
to sell banks or branches, or take other actions as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. An inability to satisfy other
material conditions necessary to consummate an acquisition transaction, such as third-party litigation, a judicial order blocking
the transaction or lack of shareholder approval, could also prevent BB&T from completing an announced acquisition.

BB&T may not be able to successfully integrate bank
or nonbank mergers and acquisitions.

Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business
and operations of BHCs, banks and other nonbank entities BB&T acquires and, as a result, BB&T may not be able to achieve
the cost savings and synergies that it expects will result from such transactions. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating
certain operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services.
Additional operational savings are dependent upon the integration of the acquired or merged entity’s businesses with BB&T
or one of BB&T’s subsidiaries, the conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products and the standardization
of business practices. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products may
result in the loss of customers, damage to BB&T’s reputation within the financial services industry, operational problems,
one-time costs currently not anticipated or reduced cost savings resulting from such mergers or acquisitions. Annual cost savings
in each such transaction may be materially less than anticipated if the holding company, bank merger or nonbank merger or acquisition
is delayed unexpectedly, the integration of operations is delayed beyond what is anticipated or the conversion to a single data
system is not accomplished on a timely basis.



Difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause BB&T
not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits
from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption
of BB&T’s businesses or the businesses of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect BB&T’s ability
to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative
effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected.

Rulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB will result
in higher regulatory and compliance costs related to originating and servicing mortgages and may adversely affect our results of
operations.

The CFPB recently has finalized a number of
significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage. These rules implement the
Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act. The final rules require banks to, among other things: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure
compliance with a new "reasonable ability to repay" test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a
"qualified mortgage;" (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages
including, but not limited to, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans
secured by a borrower's principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator
compensation; and (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained
for "higher priced mortgage loans." These new rules create operational and strategic challenges for BB&T,
as it is both a mortgage originator and a servicer. For example, business models for cost, pricing, delivery, compensation,
and risk management will need to be reevaluated and potentially revised, perhaps substantially. Additionally, programming
changes and enhancements to systems will be necessary to comply with the new rules. Some of these new rules will be effective
in June 2013, while others will be effective in January 2014. Forthcoming additional rulemaking affecting the residential
mortgage business is also expected. Achieving full compliance in the relatively short timeframe provided for certain of the
new rules will result in increased regulatory and compliance costs.

The Colonial loan portfolios are largely covered by shared-loss
agreements, however, BB&T is not immune from losses or risks relative to these portfolios.

Branch Bank acquired significant loan portfolios in connection
with its acquisition of Colonial and entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which provide that a significant portion
of losses related to the covered loan portfolios will be borne by the FDIC.  Fluctuations in economic conditions, including
those related to local residential real estate, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs
on the acquired loan portfolio and correspondingly reduce BB&T’s net income.  These fluctuations are not predictable,
cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on BB&T’s operations and financial condition even if other
favorable events occur.  Additionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms; therefore, any charge-off of related
losses that Branch Bank experiences after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively
impact BB&T’s net income.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

BB&T owns or leases significant office space used as
the Company’s headquarters in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. BB&T owns free-standing operations centers, with its primary
operations and information technology center located in Wilson, North Carolina. BB&T occupies offices that are either owned
or operated under long-term leases. At December 31, 2012, Branch Bank operated 1,832 branch offices in North Carolina, Virginia,
Florida, Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina, Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Washington D.C and Indiana. BB&T
also operates numerous insurance agencies and other businesses that occupy facilities. Office locations are either owned or leased.
Management believes that the premises occupied by BB&T and its subsidiaries are well-located and suitably equipped to serve
as financial services facilities. See Note 5 “Premises and Equipment” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” in this report for additional disclosures related to BB&T’s properties and other fixed assets.

Common Stock and Dividends

BB&T’s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent
on earnings from operations, the adequacy of capital and the availability of liquid assets for distribution. BB&T’s ability
to generate liquid assets for distribution is dependent on the ability of Branch Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. The
payment of cash dividends is an integral part of providing a competitive return on shareholders’ investments. The Company’s
policy is to accomplish this while retaining sufficient capital to support future growth and to meet regulatory requirements. Management
has established a guideline that the common dividend payout ratio will be between 30% and 50% of basic EPS during normal economic
conditions. BB&T’s common dividend payout ratio, computed by dividing dividends declared per common share by basic EPS,
was 29.2% in 2012 compared to 35.1% in 2011. BB&T has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1903. In January
2013, BB&T aligned scheduled common dividend payment dates to occur in the same quarter the dividends are declared. Going forward,
BB&T expects common dividend declarations, if declared, to occur in January, April, July and October with payment dates on
or about the first of March, June, September and December. A discussion of dividend restrictions is included in Note 16 “Regulatory
Requirements and Other Restrictions” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” and in the “Regulatory
Considerations” section.

Preferred Stock

During 2012, BB&T issued $2.2 billion of Non-Cumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock through a series of issuances for net proceeds of $2.1 billion. Dividends, if declared, accrue and are
payable quarterly, in arrears, at rates ranging from 5.20% to 5.85% per annum. See Note 11 “Shareholders’ Equity”
for additional information.

These securities are expected to qualify as non-common Tier
1 capital under the new Basel III capital rules.

Share Repurchases

BB&T has periodically repurchased shares of its own common
stock. In accordance with North Carolina law, repurchased shares cannot be held as treasury stock, but revert to the status of
authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase.

On June 27, 2006, BB&T’s Board of Directors granted
authority under the 2006 Repurchase Plan for the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of BB&T’s common stock. The 2006
Repurchase Plan also authorizes the repurchase of the remaining shares from the previous authorization. The 2006 Repurchase Plan
remains in effect until all the authorized shares are repurchased unless modified by the Board of Directors. No shares were repurchased
in connection with the 2006 Repurchase Plan during 2012, 2011 or 2010.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Overview

Significant accomplishments in 2012

The Company’s more significant accomplishments during
2012 were:

·

Record net income available to common shareholders of $1.9 billion represented a 48.6% increase over the prior year

·

Strong growth in noninterest income was driven by record insurance, mortgage banking and investment banking and brokerage commission
revenues

·

Continued improvement in credit quality with NPAs, excluding covered foreclosed property, declining $914 million, or 37.3%.
NPAs are now at their lowest level since June 30, 2008

·

Strong results from the FRB’s 2012 CCAR process, which resulted in a 25% increase to the quarterly dividend in 2012 and
a 15% increase to the quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2013. Highlights of the stress test results include:

o

One of the strongest Tier 1 common ratios (excluding capital issuances) among traditional banks

o

Lowest loan loss rate under the stress scenario among traditional banks

·

Total end of period loans held for investment increased 6.6% driven by growth in the residential mortgage, commercial and industrial,
other lending subsidiaries and direct retail lending portfolios

·

Continued improvement in deposit mix and average cost, as evidenced by a 26.4% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, and
a 25 basis point reduction in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, during 2012

·

Successful acquisition of Crump Insurance in April 2012 resulted in BB&T establishing a #1 market share in wholesale life
and a #2 market share in wholesale property and casualty in U.S. markets

·

Successful acquisition of BankAtlantic in July 2012, which enhanced BB&T’s presence in the Southeast Florida market
and resulted in a $3.5 billion increase in deposits

Challenges

BB&T’s business has become more dynamic and complex
in recent years. Consequently, management has annually evaluated and, as necessary, adjusted the Company’s business strategy
in the context of the current operating environment. During this process, management considers the current financial condition
and performance of the Company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective.
The achievement of BB&T’s key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties
and challenges. In the opinion of management, the challenges that are most relevant and likely to have a near term impact on performance
are presented below:

·

The impact of U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax negotiations

·

Intense competition within the financial services industry

·

Cost and risk associated with the regulatory initiatives

Overview of Significant Events and Financial Results

Despite challenging market conditions throughout the year,
BB&T produced record annual earnings for 2012. These results were driven by broad-based loan growth, improvements in deposit
mix and cost, a significant increase in noninterest income, and a continued focus on controlling noninterest expense. In addition,
BB&T continued to make significant progress towards reducing the level of NPAs, which had a beneficial impact on credit costs
incurred during the year.



Consolidated net income available to common shareholders
for 2012 totaled $1.9 billion, an increase of $627 million, or 48.6%, compared to $1.3 billion earned during 2011. On a diluted
per common share basis, earnings for 2012 were $2.70, compared to $1.83 for 2011. BB&T’s results of operations for 2012
produced a return on average assets of 1.14% and a return on average common shareholders’ equity of 10.35% compared to prior
year ratios of 0.82% and 7.49%, respectively.

BB&T’s revenues for 2012 were $9.8 billion on a
FTE basis, up 12.1% compared to 2011. The increase in revenues was broad based, with $350 million of the increase attributable
to higher net interest income and $707 million related to an increase in noninterest income. Net interest income on a FTE basis
was up 6.2% compared to 2011, primarily the result of a 23.1% decrease in interest expense compared to 2011. Noninterest income
increased 22.7% compared to 2011, largely the result of record insurance, mortgage banking and investment banking and brokerage
commission revenues.

Credit costs continued to improve during 2012 as NPAs, excluding
covered foreclosed property, declined $914 million, or 37.3%, compared to 2011. This decline included a $492 million decrease in
NPLs and a $422 million decrease in foreclosed real estate and other property. Net charge-offs for 2012, excluding covered, were
$1.3 billion, a decrease of $334 million, or 21.0%, compared to the prior year. BB&T recorded a $1.0 billion provision for
credit losses in 2012, excluding covered, compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. The ratio of the ALLL to net charge-offs
excluding covered was 1.50x for 2012 compared to 1.32x in 2011. Foreclosed property expenses declined $536 million, or 66.8%, during
2012, reflecting the impact of a more aggressive approach to reducing the inventory of foreclosed property that was implemented
during the fourth quarter of 2011.

BB&T’s total assets at December 31, 2012 were $183.9
billion, an increase of $9.3 billion, or 5.3%, compared to December 31, 2011. The growth in total assets includes an increase of
$7.2 billion in total loans and leases and $2.3 billion in the total securities portfolio. The growth in the loan and lease portfolio
reflects broad-based growth, led by increases in the residential mortgage, commercial and industrial and direct retail lending
portfolios. The increase in the total securities portfolio is primarily the result of purchases of investment securities that were
made in the fourth quarter of 2012 in response to slowing loan growth forecasts.

Total deposits at December 31, 2012 were $133.1 billion,
an increase of $8.1 billion, or 6.5%, from December 31, 2011. The increase in deposits was led by noninterest-bearing deposits,
which increased $6.8 billion, or 26.4%, and money market and savings accounts, which increased $3.3 billion, or 7.4%. These increases
were partially offset by a decrease in certificates and other time deposits totaling $2.3 billion. These changes resulted in a
substantial improvement to deposit mix, with noninterest-bearing accounts representing 24.4% of total deposits at December 31,
2012, compared to 20.6% at December 31, 2011. The cost of interest-bearing deposits for 2012 declined to 0.43%, a decline of 25
basis points from 0.68% for 2011.

Total shareholders’ equity increased 21.4%
compared to December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily driven by net proceeds of $2.1 billion of Tier 1 qualifying
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock during 2012 and net income retained after dividends declared. The Tier 1 common
ratio was 9.3% at December 31, 2012, compared to 9.4% at December 31, 2011. In addition, the Tier 1 risk-based capital and total
risk-based capital ratios were 11.0% and 13.9% at December 31, 2012, respectively. BB&T’s risk-based and tangible
capital ratios remain well above regulatory standards for well-capitalized banks. As of December 31, 2012, measures of
tangible capital were not required by the regulators and, therefore, were considered non-GAAP measures. Refer to the section
titled “Capital” herein for a discussion of how BB&T calculates and uses these measures in the evaluation of
the Company.

Reclassifications

In certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made
to prior period information to conform to the 2012 presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders’
equity or net income.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of BB&T are in
accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The financial
position and results of operations are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, including estimates,
assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and
expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial
position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. The more critical accounting and reporting policies
include those related to the ACL, determining fair value of financial instruments, intangible assets and other purchase accounting
related adjustments associated with mergers and acquisitions, costs and benefit obligations associated with BB&T’s pension
and postretirement benefit plans, and income taxes. Understanding BB&T’s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding
the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, BB&T’s significant accounting
policies



and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in Note 1 “Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

The following is a summary of BB&T’s critical accounting
policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments. These critical accounting policies are reviewed with
the Audit Committee of BB&T’s Board of Directors on a periodic basis.

ACL

It is the policy of BB&T to maintain an ALLL and a RUFC
that represent management’s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
Estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical loan and lease losses, historical loan and lease migration
to charge-off experience, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, expected cash flows on purchased loans, current assessment
of problem loans and leases, the results of regulatory examinations, and changes in the size, composition and risk assessment of
the loan and lease portfolio. For TDRs, default expectations and estimated slower prepayment speeds that are specific to each of
the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the ALLL. Also included in management’s estimates
for loan and lease losses are considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain.
These events may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in overall interest rates, political conditions, legislation that
may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries
in which BB&T conducts business. The methodology used to determine an estimate for the RUFC is inherently similar to the methodology
used in calculating the ALLL adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure
at the time of funding. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ALLL and the RUFC is included in Note
1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

At December 31, 2012, the percentage of total assets and
total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis was 17.3% and 0.9%, respectively, including securities available
for sale, trading securities, derivatives, LHFS, residential MSRs and private equity investments. The vast majority of assets and
liabilities carried at fair value are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. At December
31, 2012, 6.3% of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, or 1.1% of total assets, were based on significant unobservable
inputs. See Note 18 “Fair Value Disclosures” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein
for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.

Securities

BB&T generally utilizes a third-party pricing service
in determining the fair value of its available for sale and trading securities. Fair value measurements are derived from market-based
pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades,
offers, bids, issuer spreads and broker quotes. Management performs various procedures to evaluate the accuracy of the fair values
provided by the third-party service. These procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible LOB, include comparison
of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing sources, review of additional
information provided by the third party pricing service and other third party sources for selected securities, and back-testing
to compare the price realized on any security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third party pricing service.
The IPV committee, which provides oversight to BB&T’s enterprise-wide IPV function, is responsible for oversight of the
comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing sources, approving
tolerance limits determined by IPV for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies,
and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. When market observable data
is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the security is
subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management. As of December 31, 2012, BB&T had approximately $994 million
of available for sale securities, which is less than 1% of total assets, valued using unobservable inputs, the majority of which
were non-agency RMBS securities that are covered by a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC.

BB&T periodically reviews available-for-sale securities
with an unrealized loss. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized
cost basis. The purpose of the review is to consider the length of time and the extent to which the market value of a security
has been below its amortized cost. The primary factors BB&T considers in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary
are long-term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments, and BB&T’s intent to sell
and whether it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery
of the amortized cost basis.



MSRs

BB&T has a significant mortgage loan servicing portfolio
and related MSRs. BB&T has two classes of MSRs for which it separately manages the economic risk: residential and commercial.
Residential MSRs are primarily carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income.
BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value due to changes in
valuation inputs and assumptions of its residential MSRs. MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable
prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, BB&T
estimates the fair value of residential MSRs using an OAS valuation model to project MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate
scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The OAS model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually
specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and
other economic factors. BB&T reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the OAS model to
reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the MSR asset.

Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry
surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. Due to the nature of
the valuation inputs, MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The value of MSRs is significantly affected
by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods
of declining interest rates, the value of MSRs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance
activity. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of MSRs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity.
Commercial MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or market and amortized over the estimated period that servicing income is expected
to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. The amount and timing of servicing
asset amortization is based on actual results and updated projections. Refer to Note 7 “Loan Servicing” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management’s
assumptions would have on the fair value of MSRs.

LHFS

BB&T originates certain mortgage loans for sale to investors
that are carried at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types
of loans. Changes in the fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income, while the related origination costs
are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. The changes in fair value of these assets are largely driven by changes in
interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage loan held for
sale. BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans.

Derivative Assets and Liabilities

BB&T uses derivatives to manage various financial risks.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and internal pricing
models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. BB&T mitigates the credit risk by subjecting counterparties
to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterparties
are required to provide collateral to BB&T when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. The fair value
of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for
commitments that BB&T does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee.

Private Equity and Similar Investments

BB&T has private equity and similar investments that
are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded in other noninterest income each period.
In many cases there are no observable market values for these investments and management must estimate the fair value based on
a comparison of the operating performance of the company to multiples in the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires
significant judgment and actual values in a sale could differ materially from those estimated. As of December 31, 2012, BB&T
had $323 million of these investments, which represented less than 1% of total assets.

Intangible Assets

BB&T’s mergers and acquisitions are accounted for
using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, BB&T is required to record the assets acquired, including
identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed at their fair values, which often involves estimates based on third party
valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all
of which are inherently subjective. The amortization of identified intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits
to be received, which is also subjective.



Acquisitions typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment
tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. Refer to Note 1 “Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a description of BB&T’s
impairment testing process. Management considers the sensitivity of the significant assumptions in its impairment analysis including
consideration of a 10% change in estimated future cash flows or the discount rate for each reporting unit.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

BB&T offers various pension plans and postretirement
benefit plans to employees. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial
valuation methods and assumptions. Actuarial assumptions used in the determination of future values of plan assets and liabilities
are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. The discount rate assumption
used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to published high-quality bond indices, as well as certain
hypothetical spot-rate yield curves. These yield curves were constructed from the underlying bond price and yield data collected
as of the plan’s measurement date and are represented by a series of annualized, individual discount rates with durations
ranging from six months to thirty years. Each discount rate in the curve was derived from an equal weighting of the double A or
higher bond universe, apportioned into distinct maturity groups. For durations where no bond maturities were available, the discount
rates for these maturities were extrapolated based on historical relationships from observable data in similar markets. These indices
and hypothetical curves give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising
the indices and curves do not match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan precisely. For this reason, BB&T also
considers the individual characteristics of the plan, such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations, when setting
the discount rate. Management evaluated the sensitivity changes that the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would
have on pension expense for 2013. A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense
of approximately $19 million for 2013. Based on the balance of plan assets on December 31, 2012, a decrease of one percent in the
expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $30 million in pension expense for 2013. Refer to Note
14 “Benefit Plans” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for disclosures related to BB&T’s
benefit plans.

Income Taxes

The calculation of BB&T’s
income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. As part of the Company’s analysis and implementation
of business strategies, consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances
for any tax position under evaluation. For tax positions that are uncertain in nature, management determines whether the tax position
is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For tax positions that meet this threshold, management then estimates
the amount of the tax benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Management closely monitors tax developments in order to
evaluate the effect they may have on the Company’s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining
the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary.

Analysis of Results of Operations

Consolidated net income available to common shareholders
totaled $1.9 billion for 2012, which generated basic EPS of $2.74 and diluted EPS of $2.70. Net income available to common shareholders
for 2011 and 2010 was $1.3 billion and $816 million, respectively. Basic EPS was $1.85 in 2011 and $1.18 in 2010, while diluted
EPS was $1.83 and $1.16 for 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Two important and commonly used measures of bank profitability
are return on average assets (net income as a percentage of average total assets) and return on average common shareholders’
equity (net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity). BB&T’s
returns on average assets were 1.14%, 0.82%, and 0.54% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
returns on average common shareholders’ equity were 10.35%, 7.49%, and 4.85% for the last three years.

Net Interest Income and NIM

Net interest income is BB&T’s primary source of
revenue. Net interest income is influenced by a number of factors, including the volume, mix and maturity of interest-earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid thereon. The difference between rates earned on interest-earning
assets and the cost of funds (with a FTE adjustment made to tax-exempt items to provide comparability with taxable items) is measured
by the NIM.



2012 compared to 2011

For 2012, net interest income on an FTE-adjusted basis totaled
$6.0 billion, compared with $5.7 billion in 2011. Net interest income on an FTE-adjusted basis increased 6.2% in 2012 compared
to 2011. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by lower funding costs, which declined $319 million compared
to 2011. The improvement in funding costs reflects a 25 basis point reduction in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits
for 2012 compared to the prior year and the 2012 redemption of all junior subordinated debt to unconsolidated trusts. Net interest
income also benefited from the growth in average earning assets, which more than offset the negative impact of lower yields on
new loans.

The FTE-adjusted NIM is the primary measure used in evaluating
the gross profit margin from the portfolios of earning assets. The FTE-adjusted NIM was 3.91% in 2012 compared with 4.06% in 2011.
The decline in the NIM primarily reflects the runoff of higher yielding covered loans and lower yields on new loans, partially
offset by the lower funding costs described above.

Management expects NIM to be in the mid 3.70s% range in the
first quarter of 2013 as a result of lower rates on new earning assets and the runoff of covered loans, partially offset by lower
funding costs and improved asset mix. Deposit costs are expected to continue to trend lower in 2013, which would benefit net interest
income.

The FTE yield on the total securities portfolio was 2.64%
for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2.67% for the prior year. The decrease reflects a higher volume of lower yielding
RMBS securities issued by GSEs.

The average annualized FTE yield for 2012 for the total loan
portfolio was 5.35% compared to 5.87% for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the runoff of higher yielding covered
loans and a higher volume of new loans originated at lower rates.

The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits dropped
to 0.43% during 2012, from 0.68% in 2011. This improvement was a result of lower rates on interest-bearing deposits, including
a 56 basis point reduction in the cost of certificates and other time deposits and a 13 basis point reduction in the cost of money
market and savings accounts.

The rates paid on average short-term borrowings declined
from 0.27% in 2011 to 0.26% during 2012. At December 31, 2012, the targeted Federal funds rate was a range of zero percent to 0.25%.
The average rate on long-term debt during 2012 was 3.02%, a decrease of 38 basis points compared to the prior year. This reduction
was primarily due to the redemption of all higher cost junior subordinated debt to unconsolidated trusts during 2012 and the related
benefit associated with accelerated amortization of derivatives that were unwound in a gain position.

2011 compared to 2010

For 2011, net interest income on an FTE-adjusted basis totaled
$5.7 billion, compared with $5.5 billion in 2010. Net interest income on an FTE-adjusted basis increased 3.6% in 2011 compared
to 2010. The increase in net interest income was driven by lower funding costs, which declined $418 million compared to 2010. The
improvement in funding costs reflects a more favorable mix of funding liabilities, benefits from the accelerated amortization of
derivatives that were unwound in a gain position and decreases in rates paid on deposits. The improvement in funding costs more
than offset lower yields on new loans and securities. In addition, net interest income was higher due to better performance from
loans and securities acquired in the Colonial acquisition as cash flow expectations improved from the prior estimates.

The FTE-adjusted NIM is the primary measure used in evaluating
the gross profit margin from the portfolios of earning assets. The FTE-adjusted NIM was 4.06% in 2011 compared with 4.03% in 2010.
This improvement primarily reflects the higher yields on covered loans and securities and lower funding costs.

The FTE yield on the total securities portfolio was 2.67%
for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 3.89% for the prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of management’s
efforts to deleverage and de-risk the portfolio during 2010. The securities purchased included floating rate and other securities
with lower yields. The yield on the securities portfolio benefited from higher yields on covered securities due to the impact of
duration adjustments in the prior year.

The average annualized FTE yield for 2011 for the total loan
portfolio was 5.87% compared to 5.88% for the prior year. The slight decrease was primarily due to new loan volumes originated
at lower rates, partially offset by the acquired loans from the Colonial transaction, which have produced higher yields due to
better than expected performance.

The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits dropped
to 0.68% during 2011, from 1.05% in 2010. The decline was a result of the decrease in relatively higher-rate CDs and management’s
ability to lower rates on other deposit products.



The rates paid on average
short-term borrowings declined from 0.28% in 2010 to 0.27% during 2011. At December 31, 2011, the targeted Federal funds rate
was a range of zero percent to 0.25%. The average rate on long-term debt during 2011 was 3.40%, a decrease of 56 basis points compared
to the prior year. This reduction was due to new issuances at lower rates and the positive impact of accelerated amortization from
certain derivatives that were unwound in a gain position.

Covered Assets and FDIC Loss Share Receivable

In connection with the Colonial acquisition, Branch Bank
entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that outline the terms and conditions under which the FDIC will reimburse Branch
Bank for a portion of the losses incurred on certain loans, OREO, certain investment securities and other assets (collectively,
“covered assets”). The FDIC’s obligation to reimburse Branch Bank for losses with respect to covered assets
begins with the first dollar of loss incurred. The loss sharing agreement applicable to single family residential mortgage loans
expires in 2019. The loss sharing agreement applicable to commercial loans and other covered assets expires in 2014; however,
Branch Bank must reimburse the FDIC for gains and recoveries through August 2017. The terms of the loss sharing agreement with
respect to certain non-agency RMBS provides that Branch Bank will be reimbursed by the FDIC for 95% of any and all losses. For
other covered assets, the FDIC will reimburse Branch Bank for (1) 80% of losses incurred up to $5 billion and (2) 95% of losses
in excess of $5 billion. Gains and recoveries on covered assets will offset losses, or be paid to the FDIC, at the applicable
loss share percentage at the time of recovery. At the conclusion of the loss share period should actual aggregate losses, excluding
securities, be less than an amount determined in accordance with these agreements, BB&T will pay the FDIC a portion of the
difference. The fair value of the net reimbursement the Company expected to receive from the FDIC under those agreements was recorded
as the FDIC loss share receivable at the date of acquisition. The fair value of the FDIC loss share receivable was estimated using
a discounted cash flow methodology.

Acquired loans were aggregated into separate pools based
upon common risk characteristics. Each pool is considered a unit of account and the cash flows expected to be collected, credit
losses and other relevant information are developed for each pool. A summary of the accounting treatment related to changes in
credit losses on each loan pool and the related FDIC loss share asset follows.

·

If the estimated credit loss on a loan pool is increased:

o

The reduction in the net present value of the loan pool is recognized immediately as provision expense and an increase to the
ALLL.

o

The FDIC loss share asset is increased by 80% of the adjustment to the allowance through income.

·

If the estimated credit loss on a loan pool is reduced:

o

If the loan pool has an allowance, the allowance is first reduced to $0 (and 80% of this reduction decreases the FDIC loss
share asset) through income.

o

If the loan pool does not have an allowance (or it is first reduced to $0 and there remains additional expected cash flows),
the excess of expected cash flows is recognized as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected life of the loan.

o

The decrease in expected reimbursement from the FDIC is recognized in income prospectively using a level yield methodology
over the remaining life of the loss share agreements.

o

The increase in the amount expected to be paid to the FDIC as a result of the aggregate loss calculation is recognized prospectively
using a level yield methodology over the remaining life of the loss share agreements.

The accounting treatment for covered securities is summarized
below:

·

The discount established at acquisition is accreted over the expected life of the underlying securities using a level yield
methodology.

·

Changes to the expected life of the securities are recognized with a cumulative adjustment to the accretion recognized.

·

OTTI is determined using the same methodology as non-covered securities.



·

The income statement effect of the above items is offset by the applicable loss share percentage in FDIC loss share income,
net.

The following table provides the carrying amount and estimated
fair value of the components of the FDIC loss share receivable.

The decrease in the carrying amount attributable to covered
loans was due to the receipt of cash from the FDIC and the negative accretion due to the credit loss improvement partially reduced
by the offset to the provision for covered loans. The change in the carrying amount attributable to covered securities was due
to the offsets to the accretion of the discount and the amount of the increase in fair value of covered securities. The change
in the carrying amount attributable to the aggregate loss calculation is primarily due to accretion of the expected payment, which
is included in the “Accretion due to credit loss improvement” below. The fair values were based upon a discounted cash
flow methodology that was consistent with the acquisition date methodology. The fair value attributable to covered loans and the
aggregate loss calculation changes over time due to the receipt of cash from the FDIC, updated credit loss assumptions and the
passage of time. The fair value attributable to covered securities was based upon the timing and amount that would be payable to
the FDIC should they settle at the current fair value at the conclusion of the loss share agreement.

The following table provides information related to the income
statement impact of covered loans and securities and the FDIC loss sharing asset recognized in the Colonial acquisition. The table
excludes all amounts related to other assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.

2012 compared to 2011

Interest income for 2012 on covered loans and securities
acquired in the Colonial acquisition decreased $284 million compared to 2011, primarily due to lower average covered loan balances.
The yield on covered loans for 2012 was 18.91% compared to 19.15% in 2011. At December 31, 2012, the accretable yield balance on
covered loans was $881 million. Accretable yield represents the excess of expected future cash flows above the current net carrying
amount of loans and will be recognized in income over the remaining life of the covered loans.



During 2012, BB&T reduced the accretable yield balance
on covered loans by $72 million primarily due to changes in the expected lives of the underlying loans. During 2011, BB&T reclassified
$379 million from the nonaccretable balance to accretable yield on covered loans. This reclassification was primarily the result
of increased cash flow estimates resulting from improved loss expectations. These adjustments are recognized on a prospective basis
over the remaining lives of the loan pools.

The provision for covered loans was $13 million in 2012,
a decrease of $58 million compared to 2011. This decrease resulted from the quarterly reassessment process.

FDIC loss share income, net was $29 million worse than 2011
primarily due to a lower offset to the provision for covered loans.

2011 compared to 2010

Interest income for 2011 on covered loans and securities
acquired in the Colonial acquisition increased $146 million compared to 2010, which was offset by a decrease in FDIC loss share
income. The majority of the increase is related to loans and reflects higher expected cash flows based on the quarterly cash flow
reassessment process. The yield on covered loans for 2011 was 19.15% compared to 13.22% in 2010. At December 31, 2011, the accretable
yield balance on these loans was $1.7 billion. Accretable yield represents the excess of future cash flows above the current net
carrying amount of loans and will be recognized into income over the remaining life of the covered and acquired loans. The increase
in interest income on securities compared to the prior year was primarily a result of security duration adjustments in the prior
year, which is offset in FDIC loss share income.

During 2011 and 2010, BB&T reclassified $379 million
and $1.2 billion, respectively, from the nonaccretable balance to accretable yield on covered loans. These reclassifications were
primarily the result of increased cash flow estimates resulting from improved loss expectations. These amounts are recognized as
prospective yield adjustments and result in increased interest income over the remaining lives of the loan pools.

The provision for covered loans was $71 million in 2011,
a decrease of $73 million compared to 2010. The provision expenses recorded during 2011 and 2010 resulted from the quarterly reassessment
process, which showed decreases in expected cash flows in certain loan pools that were partially offset by recoveries in other
previously impaired loan pools.

FDIC loss share income, net decreased $173 million compared
to 2010 primarily due to the impact of cash flow reassessments that generated additional interest income and a reduction of amounts
due from the FDIC as a result of decreased loss projections on covered loans.

FTE Net Interest Income and Rate / Volume Analysis

The following table sets forth the major components of net
interest income and the related yields and rates for 2012, 2011 and 2010, as well as the variances between the periods caused by
changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes. Changes attributable to the mix of assets and liabilities have been allocated
proportionally between the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.





Provision for Credit Losses

2012 compared to 2011

The provision for credit losses recorded by BB&T in 2012
was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $133 million, or 11.2%, compared to the prior year. Included in the provision for credit losses
during 2012 was $13 million related to covered loans. The decrease in the provision for credit losses during 2012 compared to 2011
was primarily due to improving credit trends and outlook, as net charge-offs in 2012 decreased 22.0% compared to the prior year.
Improving credit conditions also resulted in an increase in the ratio of the ALLL to net charge-offs, which increased to 1.56 for
2012, compared to 1.36 for 2011.

Net charge-offs were 1.14% of average loans and leases (or
1.15% excluding covered loans) for 2012 compared to 1.57% of average loans and leases (or 1.59% excluding covered loans) during
2011. Net charge-offs for 2011 included $87 million related to the transfer and sale of residential mortgage loans in the second
quarter. Excluding the charge-off related to this transfer, net charge-offs were 1.50% of average loans and leases for 2011. The
largest decreases in the provision for credit losses for 2012 were in the residential mortgage and CRE - ADC portfolios.

2011 compared to 2010

The provision for credit losses recorded by BB&T in 2011
was $1.2 billion compared with $2.6 billion in 2010, which represents a decrease of 54.9% during 2011. Included in the provision
for credit losses during 2011 was $71 million related to covered loans. The provision for credit losses recorded for covered loans
reflects lower expected cash flows on certain loan pools compared to the original estimates. Approximately 80% of this provision
for credit losses is offset through a credit to noninterest income based on the provisions of the FDIC loss sharing agreements.
The decrease in the provision for credit losses during 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to improving credit trends and outlook,
as net charge-offs in 2011 decreased 34.3% compared to 2010.

Net charge-offs were 1.57% of average loans and leases (or
1.59% excluding covered loans) for 2011 compared to 2.41% of average loans and leases (or 2.59% excluding covered loans) during
2010. Net charge-offs for 2011 included $87 million related to the transfer and sale of residential mortgage loans in the second
quarter. This compares to $605 million of net charge-offs recorded in 2010 related to commercial and residential mortgage loans
that were transferred to the held for sale portfolio. Excluding these items, net charge-offs were 1.50% and 1.97% of average loans
and leases for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The largest decreases in the provision for credit losses for 2011 were in the commercial
and residential mortgage portfolios.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to BB&T’s
financial results. Noninterest income includes insurance income, service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking income,
investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, trust and investment advisory revenues, gains and losses on securities transactions,
and commissions and fees derived from other activities. Management continues to focus on diversifying its sources of revenue to
further reduce BB&T’s reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as fee-based activities are a relatively
stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

2012 compared to 2011

Noninterest income was $3.8 billion for 2012, up 22.7% compared
to 2011. This increase was driven by record income generated by BB&T’s insurance, mortgage banking and investment banking
and brokerage lines of business. In addition, bankcard fees and merchant discounts and other income increased compared to the prior
year. These increases were partially offset by lower checkcard fees, a decrease in income related to the FDIC loss share receivable
and a reduction in net securities income. The major categories of noninterest income and fluctuations in these amounts are discussed
in the following paragraphs. These fluctuations include the impact of acquisitions.

Income from BB&T’s insurance agency/brokerage operations
was the largest source of noninterest income in 2012. Insurance income was up 30.2% compared to 2011, primarily due to the acquisition
of Crump Insurance on April 2, 2012, which added approximately $234 million in revenues during 2012. The remainder of the increase
in insurance income is attributable to the impact of other acquisitions that closed during the fourth quarter of 2011 and firming
market conditions.

Mortgage banking income
totaled $840 million in 2012 compared to $436 million in 2011. The increase in mortgage banking income was primarily due to an
increase in residential mortgage production revenues totaling $378 million, which was driven by higher gains on residential mortgage
production and sales. Included in mortgage banking income for 2012 is a negative valuation adjustment of $32 million related to
changes in assumptions for residential MSRs that are carried at fair value. Approximately $22 million of the decline in the valuation
of the residential MSRs was due to a revision in the servicing cost assumption based on an expectation of higher costs that continue
to impact the industry. The remainder of the net decrease is primarily due to the impact of an increase in OAS assumption changes
partially offset by prepayment speed changes, which are reflective of the current MSR market. This decrease was more than offset
by gains of $128 million from derivative financial instruments used to manage the economic risk.

Service charges on deposit accounts, which totaled $566 million
in 2012, represent BB&T’s third largest category of noninterest revenue. Service charge revenues were essentially flat
compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of pricing changes for routine services related to retail and commercial transaction
deposit products, such as monthly maintenance fees and commercial transaction deposit products, implemented in 2011 that were designed
to offset a reduction in service charges that occurred in 2010 as a result of a change in overdraft policies.

Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions increased
$32 million, or 9.6%, compared to 2011. This increase was largely driven by a higher level of investment banking activities and
higher brokerage fees and commissions. Checkcard fees decreased $86 million, or 31.7%, due to the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank
Act, which was implemented on October 1, 2011 and limited the rate banks could assess for debit card transactions. Bankcard fees
and merchant discounts increased $32 million in 2012, primarily the result of higher volumes for both retail and commercial bankcard
activities.

FDIC loss share income reflects accretion of the FDIC receivable
due to credit loss improvement (including expense associated with the aggregate loss calculation) and accretion related to covered
securities, partially reduced by the offset to



the provision for covered loans. Covered loans have experienced better performance
than originally anticipated, which has resulted in the recognition of additional interest income on a level yield basis over the
expected life of the corresponding loans. A significant portion of this increase in interest income is offset by a reduction in
noninterest income recorded in FDIC loss share income. For 2012, noninterest income was reduced by $271 million related to improvement
in loan performance, compared to a reduction of $297 million in 2011. These decreases in income were partially offset by increases
of $11 million and $57 million, respectively, which reflected 80% of the provision for credit losses recorded on covered loans
for 2012 and 2011.

BB&T recognized $12 million in net securities losses
during 2012, compared to $62 million of net securities gains in 2011. The net securities losses during 2012 included $9 million
of OTTI charges and $3 million of net losses realized from securities sales. The net securities gains during 2011 included $174
million of net gains realized from securities sales and $112 million of OTTI charges. The OTTI charges recognized during 2011 were
due to weaker actual and forecasted collateral performance for non-agency RMBS. Refer to the “Analysis of Financial Condition
– Investment Activities” section for a detailed discussion of strategies executed during the years presented.

Other income increased $105 million in 2012 compared to 2011,
primarily due to $149 million of losses and write-downs recorded in 2011 related to the sale of commercial NPLs. This increase
was partially offset by $42 million of increased write-downs on affordable housing investments in 2012 due to revised estimates
and processes used to value these investments.

2011 compared to 2010

Noninterest income was $3.1 billion for 2011, down 21.3%
compared to 2010. The decline in noninterest revenue was due to fewer securities gains, lower income related to the FDIC loss share
receivable, lower service charges on deposit accounts and lower mortgage banking revenues, while bankcard fees and merchant discounts
and trust and investment advisory revenues grew compared to the prior year. The major categories of noninterest income and fluctuations
in these amounts are discussed in the following paragraphs. These fluctuations include the impact of acquisitions.

Insurance income was up slightly in 2011 compared to 2010,
as pricing for premiums remained soft throughout the year.

Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $563 million
in 2011, a decline of $55 million, or 8.9%, compared to 2010. The decrease in 2011 was largely a result of a decline in overdraft
fees as a result of mid-2010 changes to BB&T’s overdraft policies that were partially in response to new regulation.
In 2011, management implemented pricing changes for routine services related to retail and commercial transaction deposit products,
such as monthly maintenance fees and check enclosure fees, which partially offset the reduction in overdraft fees.

Mortgage banking income
totaled $436 million in 2011 compared to $521 million in 2010, a decrease of $85 million. This decrease was primarily due to a
decline of $97 million in residential mortgage production revenues due to lower volumes and pricing in 2011 and the decision in
the third quarter of 2010 to retain a portion of 10 to 15 year mortgage production. This decline was partially offset by higher
servicing revenues as a result of growth in the servicing portfolio and higher revenues from commercial mortgage banking revenues.
Included in mortgage banking income for 2011 is a negative valuation adjustment of $341 million related to changes in assumptions
for residential MSRs that are carried at fair value. This was more than offset by gains of $394 million from derivative financial
instruments used to manage the economic risk. Approximately $284 million of the decline in the valuation of the residential MSRs
was due to increases in the prepayment speed assumption as a result of a decrease in interest rates. During 2011, management also
revised its servicing cost assumption based on changes to regulations and industry standards that impact the mortgage servicing
industry. The change in the servicing cost assumption resulted in a decline of approximately $30 million in the valuation of the
mortgage servicing asset.

Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions decreased
$19 million, or 5.4%, compared to 2010. This decrease was largely due to weaker market conditions during the year and a record
fourth quarter in 2010.

Checkcard fees decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010,
due to the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. The decrease resulting from the implementation was more than offset by higher
volumes during the year.

Bankcard fees and merchant discounts increased $27 million
in 2011. The increased bankcard fees were the result of higher volumes for both retail and commercial bankcard activities.

Trust and investment advisory revenues are based on the types
of services provided as well as the overall value of the assets managed, which is affected by stock market conditions. In 2011,
trust and investment advisory revenues increased $14 million, or 8.8%, due to improved market conditions.



FDIC loss share income reflects the offset to the provision
for covered loans, accretion of the FDIC receivable due to credit loss improvement and accretion related to covered securities.
During 2011 and 2010, covered loans experienced better performance than originally anticipated resulting in additional interest
income. A significant portion of the increases in interest income for 2011 and 2010 was offset by reductions in noninterest income.
For 2011 and 2010, noninterest income was reduced by $297 million and $203 million, respectively, related to improvement in loan
performance. These decreases in income were partially offset by increases of $57 million and $115 million, respectively, which
reflected 80% of the provision for credit losses recorded on covered loans for 2011 and 2010.

BB&T recognized $62 million in net securities gains during
2011. The net securities gains during 2011 included $174 million of net gains realized from securities sales and $112 million of
OTTI charges. The OTTI charges recognized during 2011 are due to weaker actual and forecasted collateral performance for non-agency
RMBS. BB&T recognized $554 million in net securities gains during 2010. The net securities gains recognized in 2010 included
$585 million of net gains realized from securities sales and $31 million of losses as a result of OTTI charges. The large decrease
in securities gains during 2011 compared to 2010 reflects the results of the balance sheet deleveraging strategy that was executed
during the second quarter of 2010 and the de-risking of the investment portfolio that began during the third quarter of 2010 and
was completed in the fourth quarter. Refer to the “Analysis of Financial Condition – Investment Activities” section
for a detailed discussion of strategies executed during the years presented.

Other income decreased $60 million in 2011 compared to 2010,
primarily due to losses and write-downs on commercial loans that were transferred to the LHFS portfolio in 2010 in connection with
management’s NPL disposition strategy. There was a total of $149 million of losses and write-downs recorded in 2011 compared
to $90 million in 2010.

2012 compared to 2011

Personnel expense is the largest component of noninterest
expense and includes salaries, wages and incentives, as well as pension and other employee benefit costs. Total personnel expense
increased 14.6% during 2012, primarily the result of the Crump Insurance and BankAtlantic acquisitions during 2012. Other factors
contributing to this increase include normal salary increases, higher production-related incentives and commissions and other performance
incentives, and higher pension expense related to certain changes in actuarial assumptions. Additional disclosures relating to
BB&T’s benefit plans can be found in Note 14 “Benefit Plans” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.”

Occupancy and equipment expense increased $34 million, or
5.5%, compared to 2011 primarily due to the acquisitions of Crump Insurance and BankAtlantic.

Loan-related expense totaled $283 million, an increase of
$56 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of higher investor-owned loan expense and provisions
for higher mortgage repurchase reserves.



Foreclosed property expenses include the gain or loss on
sale of foreclosed property, valuation adjustments resulting from updated appraisals, and the ongoing expense of maintaining foreclosed
properties. Foreclosed property expense decreased $536 million, or 66.8% in 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of a more aggressive
approach to reducing the inventory of foreclosed property that was undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Regulatory charges decreased $53 million in 2012 due to improved
credit quality, which led to lower deposit insurance premiums.

Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $52 million
compared to the prior year as a result of the Crump Insurance and BankAtlantic acquisitions.

Other expense increased $62 million compared to 2011, primarily
the result of higher advertising expenses, an increase in depreciation expense related to assets under operating leases to customers
driven by growth in BB&T’s equipment financing business, higher operating charge-offs in 2012 and increased referral
fee expense. The remaining noninterest expenses increased a net $13 million, or 3.3%, compared to 2011. Refer to Table 10 for additional
detail on fluctuations in other categories of noninterest expense.

Management currently expects that total noninterest expense
should decline in the range of 1% to 2% in 2013 compared with 2012, largely driven by lower credit-related expenses.

2011 compared to 2010

Personnel expense increased $111 million, or 4.2%, during
2011 compared to 2010. This increase included an additional $90 million for salaries and wages due to customary salary increases
and higher incentive expense resulting from improved performance and production-related businesses. The increase also included
higher pension and employee benefits expense of $21 million.

Foreclosed property expense totaled $802 million in 2011,
an increase of $55 million compared to 2010. This increase was largely due to an increase of $78 million for losses and write-downs,
partially offset by a decrease of $23 million for maintenance and repair costs. Included in the losses and write-downs for 2011
was a $220 million liquidity valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter related to management’s decision to implement a more
aggressive shorter period disposition strategy for foreclosed properties. The carrying value of BB&T’s inventory of foreclosed
property decreased $723 million, or 57.4%, during 2011. This decline reflects management’s more aggressive efforts to liquidate
properties and fewer inflows.

Loan-related expense totaled $227 million, an increase of
$26 million compared to 2010. This increase includes a $12 million increase for losses related to repurchase reserves on BB&T’s
investor owned servicing portfolio.

The remaining noninterest expenses decreased a net $60 million,
or 2.8%, compared to 2010. This decrease includes lower merger-related and restructuring charges, as 2010 included charges related
to the Colonial acquisition and systems conversion. In addition, amortization of intangibles declined by $23 million, as intangibles
are amortized on an accelerated basis. Noninterest expense for 2011 also includes a $16 million loss from the sale of leveraged
leases and an $11 million charge for an increase to the indemnification reserve related to the 2008 sale of Visa stock. These increases
were partially offset by $19 million in lower advertising and other marketing expenses.

Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges

BB&T recorded certain merger-related and restructuring
charges during the years 2012, 2011 and 2010. These charges are reflected in BB&T’s Consolidated Statements of Income
as a category of noninterest expense.

Merger-related and restructuring expenses or credits include:
severance and personnel-related costs or credits, which typically occur in corporate support and data processing functions; occupancy
and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs,
and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment; and other merger-related and restructuring charges or credits, which include
expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related
to the acquisitions, asset and supply inventory write-offs, investment banking advisory fees and other similar charges.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were $11 million and
$20 million, respectively, of merger-related and restructuring accruals. Merger-related and restructuring accruals are established
when the costs are incurred or once all requirements for a plan to dispose of certain business functions have been approved by
management. In general, a major portion of accrued costs are utilized in conjunction with or immediately following the systems
conversion, when most of the duplicate positions are eliminated and the terminated employees begin to receive severance. Other
accruals are utilized over time based on the sale, closing or disposal of duplicate facilities or equipment or the expiration of
lease contracts. Merger and restructuring



accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted
as necessary. The remaining accruals at December 31, 2012 are generally expected to be utilized during 2013, unless they relate
to specific contracts that expire in later years.

Provision for Income Taxes

BB&T’s provision for income taxes totaled $764
million, $296 million and $115 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. BB&T’s effective tax rates for the years
ended 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 27.4%, 18.2% and 11.9%, respectively. The increases in the effective tax rate for 2012 compared
to 2011, and 2011 compared to 2010, reflect higher levels of pre-tax earnings relative to permanent income tax differences.

BB&T has extended credit to and invested in the obligations
of states and municipalities and their agencies, and has made other investments and loans that produce tax-exempt income. The income
generated from these investments, together with certain other transactions that have favorable tax treatment, have reduced BB&T’s
overall effective tax rate from the statutory rate in all periods presented.

Management currently expects the effective tax rate in the
first quarter of 2013 to be similar to the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Refer to Note 13 “Income Taxes” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory tax rate and a discussion
of uncertain tax positions and other tax matters.

Segment Results

BB&T’s operations are divided into six reportable
business segments: Community Banking, Residential Mortgage Banking, Dealer Financial Services, Specialized Lending, Insurance Services
and Financial Services. These segments have been identified based on BB&T’s organizational structure. See Note 21 “Operating
Segments” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional disclosures related to BB&T’s
operating segments, the internal accounting and reporting practices used to manage these segments and financial disclosures for
these segments.

Fluctuations in noninterest income and noninterest expense
incurred directly by the segments are more fully discussed in the “Noninterest Income” and “Noninterest Expense”
sections above.

2012 compared to 2011

Community Banking

Community Banking had a

network
of 1,832 banking offices at the end of 2012, an increase of 53 offices compared to December 31, 2011. The increase in offices was
driven by the BankAtlantic acquisition and de novo branch openings, partially offset by the closing of low volume branches.

Community
Banking results include BankAtlantic since the systems conversion in October 2012. Community Banking net income was $752 million
in 2012, up $216 million, or 40.3%, compared to 2011.

Segment net interest income for Community Banking totaled
$3.4 billion in 2012 compared to $3.6 billion in 2011. The decrease in segment net interest income was primarily attributable to
lower funding credits on deposits as the result of declining interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by loan growth
and improvement in the deposit mix, which was the result of an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and a decrease in client
CDs.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses increased
by $77 million, or 13.1%, to $666 million in 2012, primarily due to loan growth and reserve rate adjustments, partially offset
by lower charge-offs.

Noninterest income in Community Banking increased $109 million,
or 10.7%, to $1.1 billion in 2012, primarily due to higher bankcard and merchant fees, as well as losses on commercial LHFS in
the prior year. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset by lower debit interchange and overdraft fees. Noninterest
income allocated from other segments, which is reported as intersegment net referral fees (“referral fees”), increased
by $50 million, or 37.9% in 2012, driven by higher referrals for residential mortgage lending as originations grew.

Noninterest expense incurred by Community Banking during
2012 declined $526 million, or 22.3%, to $1.8 billion. This decline was primarily due to lower foreclosed property expense and
regulatory charges, partially offset by higher net occupancy expense and personnel expense. Allocated corporate expense increased
$126 million, or 14.0%, to $1.0 billion in 2012, primarily due to increases in loan administration, operations and marketing expense.



Residential Mortgage Banking

BB&T’s mortgage originations totaled $33.1 billion
in 2012, up $9.4 billion, or 39.9%, compared to 2011. BB&T’s residential mortgage servicing portfolio, which includes
both retained loans and loans serviced for third parties, totaled $101.3 billion at the end of 2012, an increase of 10.5%, compared
to $91.6 billion at December 31, 2011. Residential Mortgage Banking net income was $366 million in 2012, compared to a net
loss of $15 million in 2011.

Segment net interest income in Residential Mortgage Banking
increased $81 million, or 27.8%, to $372 million in 2012. The increase in segment net interest income was primarily due to growth
in LHFS, growth in loans held for investment and higher spreads to funding costs on loans held for investment. These increases
in segment net interest income were partially offset by lower spreads to funding costs on LHFS.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses was $95
million for 2012, down $225 million, or 70.3%, compared to $320 million in 2011. The decrease in provision expense reflects improved
credit quality in the loan portfolio, as well as the sale of NPLs in the second quarter of 2011, which resulted in higher charge-offs.
Net charge-offs of $133 million were recorded in 2012 compared to $264 million in 2011.

Noninterest income in Residential Mortgage Banking increased
from $349 million in 2011 to $753 million in 2012. This increase was primarily due to higher mortgage loan production and sales
and higher margins than in the prior year.

Noninterest expense increased $92 million, or 31.1%, to $388
million in 2012, reflecting higher loan-related and personnel expenses. The increase in loan-related expense was driven by an increase
in the loan repurchase reserve. The increase in personnel expense was driven by a higher number of employees and incentives related
to the increased production.

Dealer Financial Services

Dealer Financial Services net income was $208 million in
2012, a decrease of $1 million, or 0.5%, compared to 2011.

Segment net interest income in Dealer Financial Services
increased $47 million, or 8.1%, to $629 million in 2012. The increase in segment net interest income was primarily due to loan
growth and an improved NIM in Regional Acceptance Corporation’s point-of-sale loan portfolio.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses increased
$39 million, or 31.2%, in 2012, primarily due to increases in Regional Acceptance Corporation’s allowance for loan losses
related to nonprime auto loans as delinquent accounts and NPAs move from historical lows to more normalized levels.

Specialized Lending

Specialized Lending net income was $235 million in 2012,
flat compared to 2011.

Specialized Lending net interest income increased $82 million,
or 17.6%, to $547 million in 2012. This increase was primarily due to strong loan growth by Sheffield Financial as the result of
dealer volume growth and expanded dealer relationships. Additionally, Mortgage Warehouse Lending benefited from increased market
penetration, higher commitment levels and higher line usage, while Lendmark and Equipment Finance realized higher NIM. Average
loans for Specialized Lending grew by $2.0 billion, or 15.6%, to $14.8 billion in 2012.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses increased
$65 million, or 90.3%, in 2012. The increase in provision expense was primarily due to reserve rate adjustments, as well as adjustments
to loss factors resulting from an acceleration of certain consumer loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2012. Due to the overall
higher credit risk profiles of Specialized Lending’s clients, loss rates are expected to be higher than conventional bank
lending. Loss rates are also affected by shifts in the portfolio mix of the underlying subsidiaries.

Noninterest income increased $17 million, or 8.1%, to $228
million in 2012. The increase in noninterest income was driven by higher operating lease income and gains on sale of finance lease
equipment by Equipment Finance, as well as higher commercial finance and commercial mortgage banking fees.

Noninterest expense increased $23 million, or 9.9%, to $256
million. The increase in noninterest expense was driven by higher depreciation on property leased to customers by Equipment Finance,
higher loan referral fees paid by Sheffield Financial and higher personnel expense.



Insurance Services

Insurance Services net income was $144 million in 2012, an
increase of $43 million, or 42.6%, compared to 2011. The increase in net income was driven by acquisitions and improving premium
pricing in the property and casualty insurance business.

Noninterest income increased $325 million, or 31.3%, to $1.4
billion. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by higher life insurance, property and casualty insurance and
employee benefits commissions. The life insurance and property and casualty operations of Crump Insurance, which was acquired on
April 2, 2012, contributed $234 million of insurance income. Property and casualty insurance commission growth was partially attributable
to improvement in premium pricing compared to the prior year. Employee benefits commission growth was primarily due to the acquisitions
of Precept, a full-service employee benefits consulting and administrative solutions firm with offices in Irvine and San Ramon,
California and Liberty Benefit Insurance Services, a full-service employee benefits broker located in San Jose, California, in
the fourth quarter of 2011.

Noninterest expenses incurred within the Insurance Services
segment increased $229 million, or 29.1%, in 2012. The increase in noninterest expenses was primarily due to the Crump Insurance
acquisition and related personnel expense, occupancy expense and amortization of intangibles.

Financial Services

Financial Services net income was $286 million in 2012, up
$13 million, or 4.8%, compared to 2011.

Segment net interest income for Financial Services increased
$77 million, or 20.6%, to $451 million in 2012. The increase in segment net interest income during 2012 was primarily attributable
to strong organic loan and deposit growth by Corporate Banking and BB&T Wealth, partially offset by a lower NIM for both businesses.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses increased
$11 million to $10 million in 2012 as the result of reserve rate adjustments related to the commercial and industrial loan portfolio,
combined with overall growth in the loan portfolio.

Noninterest income for Financial Services increased $31 million,
or 4.5%, to $725 million in 2012. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to higher investment banking and brokerage
fees and commissions, trust and investment advisory revenues and commercial loan fees.

Noninterest expense incurred by Financial Services increased
$67 million, or 11.7%, to $641 million in 2012, primarily due to higher personnel expense and intercompany expense. The increase
in noninterest expense in 2012 was driven by continued efforts to expand the national lending teams in Corporate Banking and by
the associated increases in incentive expenses tied to the strong income growth in the LOBs.

Other, Treasury & Corporate

Net income in Other, Treasury & Corporate can vary due
to changing needs of the Company, including the size of the investment portfolio, the need for wholesale funding, income received
from derivatives used to hedge the balance sheet and, in certain cases, income associated with acquisition activities. Other, Treasury
& Corporate’s 2012 results reflect the income from BankAtlantic from the acquisition date to the systems conversion date
in October 2012. Other, Treasury & Corporate generated net income of $37 million in 2012 compared to a net loss of $7 million
in the prior year.

The increase in segment net interest income was primarily
due to a decrease in FTP funding credits on deposits allocated to the Community Banking segment. The decrease in the allocated
provision for loan losses was primarily the result of a decline in the provision for covered loans. The decrease in noninterest
income was primarily due to higher securities gains in the prior year, increased write-downs on affordable housing investments
and lower FDIC loss share income. The decrease in allocated corporate expenses was primarily due to changes in intersegment service
center allocations.

2011 compared to 2010

Community Banking

Community Banking had a network of 1,779 banking offices
at the end of 2011, a decrease of 3 offices compared to 1,782 banking offices at December 31, 2010. The decrease in offices
was the result of closing low volume branches partially offset by de novo branch openings. Net income attributable to Community
Banking increased $460 million to $536 million in 2011.



Segment net interest income for Community Banking totaled
$3.6 billion in 2011 compared to $3.8 billion in 2010. The decline in segment net interest income was primarily the effect of a
lower interest rate environment. The decline in segment net interest income was primarily attributable to lower funding credits
on deposits as the result of declining interest rates, This decline was partially offset by improvements in the deposit mix, as
the result of growth in noninterest checking balances and a decrease in client CD balances.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses declined
$1.2 billion, or 67.3%, to $589 million in 2011, reflecting lower charge-offs in the CRE loan portfolios associated with improved
credit quality metrics and charge-offs associated with the accelerated disposition of commercial NPLs during 2011.

Noninterest income in Community Banking decreased $184 million,
or 15.3%, to $1.0 billion in 2011, primarily due to higher losses on commercial NPLs held for sale, lower overdraft fees and lower
debit interchange fees. This decline in noninterest income was offset by increases in merchant discounts, deposit account service
charges, account analysis fees and credit card interchange fees. Noninterest income allocated from other segments, which is reported
as intersegment net referral fees (“referral fees”), declined by $14 million, or 9.6% in 2011, This decline was driven
by lower referrals for residential mortgage lending as originations slowed.

Noninterest expense for Community Banking declined $19 million
in 2011, or 0.8%, to $2.4 billion compared to 2010. The decline was primarily due to lower regulatory charges and personnel expense,
partially offset by higher foreclosed property expense. Allocated corporate expense increased $100 million, or 12.5%, to $899 million
in 2011, primarily due to increases in loan administration expense, IT services and operations.

Residential Mortgage Banking

BB&T’s mortgage originations totaled $23.7 billion
in 2011, down $1.2 billion, or 4.8%, compared to 2010. BB&T’s residential mortgage servicing portfolio, which includes
both retained loans and loans serviced for third parties, totaled $91.6 billion at year end 2011, an increase of 9.8%, compared
to $83.5 billion at December 31, 2010. Residential Mortgage Banking experienced a net loss of $15 million in 2011, compared
to a net loss of $77 million in 2010.

Segment net interest income for Residential Mortgage Banking
totaled $291 million in 2011, up $31 million, or 11.9%, compared to 2010. The increase in segment net interest income in 2011 was
primarily due to growth in the loans held for investment, as well as higher spreads compared to funding costs.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses was $320
million for 2011, down $233 million, or 42.1%, compared to $553 million in 2010. The decline in provision expense reflects improved
credit quality in the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs of $87 million and $141 million were recorded in 2011 and 2010, respectively,
impacted by the sale of problem loans in connection with management’s NPL disposition strategy.

Noninterest income in Residential Mortgage Banking declined
$108 million, or 23.6%, to $349 million in 2011. This decrease was due to lower volumes and margins on loans originated for sale.
Noninterest expense increased $42 million, or 16.5%, to $296 million compared to 2010, reflecting higher foreclosed property expense,
as well as increased provision expense associated with loan repurchases.

Dealer Financial Services

Net income from Dealer Financial Services was $209 million
in 2011, up $24 million, or 13.0%, over 2010.

Segment net interest income for Dealer Financial Services
increased by $68 million, or 13.2%, to $582 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in segment net interest income was primarily
due to growth in the prime auto and marine and recreational vehicle loan portfolios, as well as an improved NIM in Regional
Acceptance Corporation’s point-of-sale loan portfolio.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses of $125
million was up $32 million, or 34.4%, in 2011, primarily due to increases in Regional Acceptance Corporation’s allowance
for loan losses related to nonprime auto loans as delinquent accounts and NPAs move from historical lows to more normalized levels.

Specialized Lending

Specialized Lending continued to expand during 2011 through
strong organic growth. Net income was $235 million for 2011, up $67 million, or 39.9%, compared to 2010.



Segment net interest income totaled $465 million in 2011,
an increase of $58 million, or 14.3%, compared to 2010. The growth in segment net interest income in 2011 was driven by strong
loan growth in Sheffield Financial as the result of dealer volume growth and expanded dealer relationships, as well as higher
NIM for Lendmark and Governmental Finance. Average loans for Specialized Lending grew by $1.3 billion, or 11.2%, to $12.8 billion
in 2011 compared to 2010.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses totaled
$72 million in 2011, a decrease of $38 million, or 34.5%, compared to 2010. The decline in the provision for 2011 was primarily
attributable to generally improved credit performance across the lines of business. Due to the overall higher credit risk profiles
of some of Specialized Lending’s clients, loss rates are expected to be higher than conventional bank lending. Loss rates
are also affected by shifts in the portfolio mix of the underlying subsidiaries.

Noninterest income totaled $211 million in 2011, an increase
of $35 million, or 19.9%, compared to 2010. Noninterest income growth in 2011 was driven by Grandbridge, which achieved record
commercial mortgage loan origination volume for delivery to the secondary market.

Noninterest expense totaled $233 million in 2011, an increase
of $15 million, or 6.9%, compared to 2010. The increase in noninterest expense was driven by personnel expenses related to growth
in commercial mortgage lending activities.

Insurance Services

Net income from Insurance Services was $101 million in 2011,
down $2 million, or 1.9%, compared to 2010. Insurance Services was impacted by the weak economy and soft insurance premium pricing,
resulting in low commission revenue growth and pressure on brokerage operating margins.

Noninterest income produced by Insurance Services totaled
$1.0 billion during both 2011 and 2010. Revenue generated by acquisitions was offset by weaker pricing.

Noninterest expenses incurred within the Insurance Services
segment increased $12 million, or 1.6%, in 2011 compared to 2010. This increase was due to higher operating costs, including increased
legal costs compared to 2010.

Financial Services

Net income from Financial Services increased by $39 million,
or 16.7%, to $273 million in 2011, compared to 2010.

Segment net interest income totaled $374 million in 2011,
an increase of $60 million, or 19.1%, compared to 2010. The increase in segment net interest income during 2011 was attributable
to strong organic loan and deposit growth in Corporate Banking, offset by a lower NIM.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses declined
$46 million, or 102.2%, to a $1 million benefit in 2011, reflecting lower reserve rates for commercial and industrial loans with
the continued excellent credit quality performance.

Noninterest income in Financial Services totaled $694 million
in 2011, up $37 million, or 5.6%, compared to $657 million earned during 2010. This increase is primarily attributable to strong
BB&T Capital Partners revenue growth related to maturing investments in its private equity and mezzanine funds. Additionally,
Retirement and Institutional Services had strong noninterest income growth in 2011, with assets growing as the result of improved
market conditions and business initiatives.

Noninterest expense of $574 million incurred by Financial
Services increased $47 million, or 8.9%, in 2011. The increase in noninterest expense in 2011 was impacted by the continued efforts
to expand the sales force in Corporate Banking and BB&T Wealth.

Other, Treasury & Corporate

In 2011, the Other, Treasury & Corporate segment generated
a $7 million net loss, compared to net income of $165 million for the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily due
to a $634 decrease in noninterest income, driven by securities gains recognized in 2010. The decrease in noninterest income was
partially offset by a $197 million increase in segment net interest income, primarily due to

a decrease
in FTP funding credits on deposits allocated to the Community Banking segment.

The overall decrease in FTP credits was partially
offset by lower yields on the investment portfolio. In addition, the income tax benefit was $196 million higher than in the prior
year.



Analysis of Financial Condition

A review of the Company’s major balance sheet categories
is presented below.

Investment Activities

BB&T’s investment activities are governed internally
by a written, board-approved policy. The investment policy is carried out by the MRLCC, which meets regularly to review the economic
environment and establish investment strategies. The MRLCC also has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the “Market
Risk Management” section in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
herein.

Investment strategies are reviewed by the MRLCC based on
the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest
rate sensitivity of the Company. In general, the investment portfolio is managed in a manner appropriate to the attainment of the
following goals: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and
overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds, trust deposits as prescribed
by law and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the
requirements of (i) and (ii).

Branch Bank invests in securities as allowable under bank
regulations. These securities may include obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, GSEs (including RMBS), bank
eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, non-agency RMBS, structured notes, bank eligible corporate obligations
(including corporate debentures), commercial paper, negotiable CDs, bankers acceptances, mutual funds and limited types of equity
securities. Branch Bank also may deal in securities subject to the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. BB&T’s full-service
brokerage and investment banking subsidiary engages in the underwriting, trading and sales of equity and debt securities subject
to the risk management policies of the Company.

The total securities portfolio increased $2.3 billion, or
6.4%, in 2012. This growth was primarily driven by purchases of investment securities in the fourth quarter of 2012 that were made
in response to slowing loan growth forecasts.

As of December 31, 2012, approximately 18.3% of the securities
portfolio was variable rate. The effective duration of the securities portfolio was 2.8 years at December 31, 2012 compared to
3.3 years at the end of 2011. The duration of the securities portfolio excludes equity securities, auction rate securities, and
certain covered non-agency RMBS. During the first quarter of 2011, BB&T reclassified approximately $8.3 billion from securities
available for sale to securities held to maturity. Management determined that it has both the positive intent and ability to hold
these securities to maturity. The reclassification of these securities was accounted for at fair value. Management transferred
these securities to mitigate



possible negative impacts on its regulatory capital under the proposed Basel III capital guidelines.
In addition, management purchased additional securities into the held-to-maturity portfolio based on its intent at the date of
purchase.

RMBS issued by GSEs were 78.0% of the total securities portfolio
at year-end 2012. As of December 31, 2012, the available-for-sale securities portfolio also includes $1.6 billion of securities
that were acquired from the FDIC as part of the Colonial acquisition. These securities are covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements
and include $1.3 billion of non-agency RMBS and $326 million of municipal securities.

During 2012, management sold $306 million of securities that
produced a realized loss of $3 million. In addition, BB&T recognized $9 million in charges for OTTI related to certain non-agency
RMBS and covered securities. In 2011, primarily in connection with strengthening its liquidity under the proposed Basel III liquidity
guidelines, management purchased a total of $13.4 billion of GNMA RMBS. Management also sold approximately $4.0 billion of securities
during 2011, which produced net securities gains of $174 million. In addition, BB&T recognized $112 million in charges for
OTTI during 2011 related to BB&T’s portfolio of non-agency RMBS. The OTTI charges were the result of weaker actual and
forecasted collateral performance for non-agency RMBS.

In 2010, management executed two major strategies to strengthen
the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2010, management executed a deleveraging strategy to better position BB&T’s
balance sheet for a rising rate environment and achieve a better mix of earning assets. In connection with this strategy, management
reduced the balance sheet by approximately $8 billion through the sale of securities. During the third and fourth quarters of 2010,
management executed a strategy to further de-risk the available-for-sale securities portfolio. The de-risking strategy was aimed
at further reducing the duration of the securities portfolio and reducing the risk of charges to OCI in a rising rate environment.
Also to further protect against the risk of a rising rate environment, management replaced a portion of the securities sold with
floating-rate securities. In addition, management sold approximately $400 million of non-agency RMBS to reduce the potential for
future credit losses. These strategies were the primary driver in generating net securities gains during 2010. Primarily in connection
with these strategies, BB&T sold a total of $31.3 billion in available-for-sale securities during 2010, which produced net
securities gains of $585 million. In addition, BB&T recognized $31 million in charges for OTTI related to BB&T’s
portfolio of non-agency RMBS.

Refer to Note 2 “Securities” in the “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional disclosures related to BB&T’s evaluation of securities
for OTTI.

Yields are calculated on a taxable-equivalent basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%.  Yields for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the amortized cost of the securities.

(2)

For purposes of the maturity table, RMBS, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity.  The expected life of RMBS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the underlying mortgage loans with or without call or prepayment penalties.

(3)

Weighted-average yield excludes the effect of pay-fixed swaps hedging municipal securities.

Lending Activities

The primary goal of the BB&T lending function is to help
clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the Company.
Management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong, profitable client relationships over time, with
BB&T becoming an important contributor to the prosperity and well-being of its clients. In addition to the importance placed
on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, BB&T’s lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent
company-wide credit culture and an in-depth local market knowledge. Furthermore, the Company employs strict underwriting criteria
governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration.
In



this context, BB&T strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced
strategy of loan profitability, loan growth and loan quality.

The following table summarizes BB&T’s loan portfolio
based on the regulatory classification of the portfolio, which focuses on the underlying loan collateral, and differs from internal
classifications presented herein that focus on the primary purpose of the loan. Covered loans are included in their respective
categories.

Scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category
in which the payment is due. Determinations of maturities are based upon contract terms. BB&T’s credit policy typically
does not permit automatic renewal of loans. At the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the customer generally
must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions
negotiated at that time.



BB&T’s loan portfolio is approximately 50% commercial
and 50% retail by design, and is divided into six major categories—commercial, direct retail, sales finance, revolving credit,
residential mortgage and other lending subsidiaries. In addition, BB&T has a portfolio of loans that were acquired in the
Colonial acquisition that are covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements. BB&T lends to a diverse customer base that is substantially
located within the Company’s primary market area. At the same time, the loan portfolio is geographically dispersed throughout
BB&T’s branch network to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. Refer to the
“Risk Management” section herein for a discussion of each of the loan portfolios and the credit risk management policies
used to manage the portfolios.

The following table presents BB&T’s total loan
portfolio based upon BB&T’s lines of business, as discussed herein, rather than upon regulatory reporting classifications:

Average total loans were $113.7 billion for 2012, up $7.8
billion compared to the prior year. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $2.8 billion, or 8.2%, in 2012 as compared
to 2011. The increase in the commercial and industrial portfolio was driven by investments in corporate banking in key national
markets and the expansion of vertical lending teams focused on targeted industries. Average CRE – other loans for 2012 decreased
$360 million, or 3.2%, compared to 2011. The average CRE – residential ADC portfolio declined $1.1 billion, or 39.9%, compared
to the average balance for 2011, as management continued to reduce exposure to higher risk real estate lending.

Average direct retail loans increased 10.3% during 2012,
primarily due to increased demand for home equity loans and an increase in non-real estate loans generated through the wealth and
small business lending channels. This growth was partially offset by continued runoff of the residential lot/land component of
this portfolio as management has continued to reduce exposures to these types of loans. Average sales finance loans and average
revolving credit reflected 2012 growth rates of 6.6% and 5.3%, respectively. BB&T concentrates its efforts on the highest quality
borrowers in both of these product markets. The growth in average sales finance loans was primarily driven by an increase in prime
automobile lending, which reflects increased momentum in the new and used automobile markets during 2012.

Average residential mortgage loans increased $3.8 billion,
or 20.5%, compared to 2011. The increase in residential mortgage loans was driven by a previous strategy that resulted in a higher
portion of 10 to 15 year mortgage production being retained in the held for investment loan portfolio. During the second quarter
of 2012, this strategy was modified such that the majority of future loan production is directed to the held for sale portfolio.
As a result, management expects slower growth in the residential mortgage loan portfolio during 2013.

Average loans held by BB&T’s other lending subsidiaries
increased $1.2 billion, or 15.0%, compared to 2011. The growth in this portfolio was primarily in small ticket finance, equipment
leasing and nonprime automobile financing.

Asset Quality

The following discussion excludes assets covered by FDIC
loss sharing agreements that provide for reimbursement to BB&T for the majority of losses incurred on those assets. Covered
loans, which are considered performing due to the application of the accretion method of accounting, were $3.3 billion at December
31, 2012 and $4.9 billion in the prior year. Covered foreclosed property totaled $254 million and $378 million at December 31,
2012 and 2011, respectively.

NPAs, which include foreclosed real estate, repossessions
and nonaccrual loans, totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2012, compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2011. The decline in
NPAs of $914 million was driven by a decrease of $492 million in NPLs and $422 million in foreclosed property. The decline in NPLs
was broad-based, reflecting decreases in most loan portfolios, including a 34.5% decrease in commercial NPLs. The decline in foreclosed
property reflects a more



aggressive approach to reducing the inventory of foreclosed property that was implemented during the fourth
quarter of 2011. The current inventory of foreclosed real estate as of December 31, 2012 includes land and lots, totaling $35 million
that have been held for approximately 15 months on average. The remaining foreclosed real estate of $72 million, which is primarily
single family residential and commercial real estate, had an average holding period of seven months. NPAs as a percentage of loans
and leases plus foreclosed property were 1.33% at December 31, 2012 compared with 2.29% at December 31, 2011.

Management expects NPAs to improve at a modest pace during
the first quarter of 2013, assuming no significant economic deterioration during the quarter.

The following table presents the changes in NPAs during 2012
and 2011.

Tables 18 and 19 summarize asset quality information for
the past five years. As more fully described below, this information has been adjusted to exclude past due loans that are subject
to FDIC loss sharing agreements and certain mortgage loans guaranteed by the government:

·

In accordance with regulatory reporting standards, covered loans that are contractually past due
are reported as past due and still accruing based on the number of days past due. However, given the significant amount of acquired
loans that are past due but still accruing due to the application of the accretion method, BB&T has concluded that it is appropriate
to adjust Table 18 to exclude covered loans in summarizing total loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing and total loans
30-89 days past due and still accruing.

·

BB&T has also concluded that the inclusion of covered loans in certain asset quality ratios
summarized in Table 19 including “Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing as a percentage of total loans and leases,”
“Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of total loans and leases,” “Nonperforming
loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases” and certain other asset quality ratios that reflect NPAs in the
numerator or denominator (or both) results in significant distortion to these ratios. In addition, because loan level charge-offs
related to the acquired loans are not recognized in the financial statements until the cumulative amounts exceed the original loss
projections on a pool basis, the net charge-off ratio for the acquired loans is not consistent with the net charge-off ratio for
other loan portfolios. The inclusion of these loans in the asset quality ratios described above could result in a lack of comparability
across quarters or years, and could negatively impact comparability with other portfolios that were not impacted by acquisition
accounting. BB&T believes that the presentation of asset quality measures excluding covered loans and related amounts from
both the numerator and denominator provides better perspective into underlying trends related to the quality of its loan portfolio.
Accordingly, the asset quality measures in Table 19 present asset quality information both on a consolidated basis as well as excluding
the covered assets and related amounts.

·

In addition, BB&T has excluded mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the government, primarily
FHA/VA loans, from the asset quality metrics and ratios reflected on Tables 18 and 19, as these loans are recoverable through various
government guarantees. In addition, BB&T has recorded on the balance sheet



certain amounts related to delinquent GNMA loans
serviced for others that BB&T has the option, but not the obligation, to repurchase and has effectively regained control. These
amounts are also excluded from asset quality metrics as reimbursement of insured amounts is proceeding in accordance with investor
guidelines. The amount of government guaranteed mortgage loans and GNMA loans serviced for others that have been excluded are noted
in the footnotes to Table 18.

Net charge-offs for 2011 and 2010 include $695 million and $236 million, respectively, related to BB&T’s NPA disposition
strategy. In connection with this strategy, approximately $271 million and $1.9 billion of problem loans



were transferred from
loans held for investment to LHFS in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The disposition of all such loans was complete as of December
31, 2011.

(4)

These asset quality ratios have been adjusted to remove the impact of covered loans and covered foreclosed property. Appropriate
adjustments to the numerator and denominator have been reflected in the calculation of these ratios.

BB&T’s potential problem loans include loans on nonaccrual
status or past due as disclosed in Table 18. In addition, for its commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention
or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. Refer to Note 4 “Allowance for
Credit Losses” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional disclosures related
to these potential problem loans.

TDRs generally occur when a borrower is experiencing, or
is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near-term. As a result, BB&T will work with the borrower to prevent
further difficulties, and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. To facilitate this process, a concessionary
modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR. Refer to Note
1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
additional policy information regarding TDRs.

BB&T’s performing TDRs, excluding government guaranteed
mortgage loans, totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of $218 million, or 19.7%, compared with December 31, 2011.
This increase was attributable to guidance issued by a national bank regulatory agency during 2012 that requires certain loans,
which have been discharged in bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower, to be accounted for as a TDR and possibly as nonperforming,
regardless of their actual payment history and expected performance. BB&T’s primary regulators have not formalized how
this guidance will be applied to the entities that it regulates. However, based on a preliminary interpretation of this guidance,
BB&T classified $226 million of performing loans across all loan portfolios as TDRs during the fourth quarter of 2012. Approximately
77% of these loans have been current for two years or more and approximately 92% are less than 60 days past due. As a result, BB&T
concluded that it has a reasonable expectation of collection of principal and interest and therefore has classified these TDRs
as performing. BB&T’s exposure to the expected collateral shortfall has been considered in the ALLL recorded at December
31, 2012.

In addition, BB&T classified approximately $44 million
of loans already on nonaccrual status as TDRs as a result of regulatory guidance described above. The classification of these loans
as TDRs had an insignificant impact on the allowance as these loans had been previously charged down to their estimated collateral
value less costs to sell.

The following table provides a summary of performing TDR
activity during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Payments and payoffs represent cash received from borrowers
in connection with scheduled principal payments, prepayments and payoffs of amounts outstanding. Transfers to nonperforming TDRs
represent loans that no longer meet the requirements necessary to reflect the loan in accruing status and as a result are subsequently
classified as a nonperforming TDR.

TDRs may be removed due to the passage of time if they: (1)
did not include a forgiveness of principal or interest, (2) have performed in accordance with the modified terms (generally a minimum
of six months), (3) were reported as a TDR over a year end reporting period, and (4) reflected an interest rate on the modified
loan that was no less than a market rate at the date of modification. These loans were previously considered TDRs as a result of
structural concessions such as extended interest-only terms or an amortization period that did not otherwise conform to normal
underwriting guidelines.



In addition, certain transactions may be removed from classification
as a TDR as a result of a subsequent non-concessionary re-modification. Non-concessionary re-modifications represent TDRs that
did not contain concessionary terms at the date of a subsequent renewal/modification and there was a reasonable expectation that
the borrower would continue to comply with the terms of the loan subsequent to the date of the re-modification. A re-modification
may be considered for such a re-classification if the loan has not had a forgiveness of principal or interest and the modified
terms qualify as more than minor such that the re-modified loan is considered a new loan. Alternatively, such loans may be considered
for reclassification in years subsequent to the date of the re-modification based on the passage of time as described in the preceding
paragraph.

In connection with consumer loan TDRs, a NPL will be returned
to accruing status when current as to principal and interest and upon a sustained historical repayment performance (generally a
minimum of six months).

payment status of TDRs outstanding at December 31, 2012:

ACL

The ACL, which totaled $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion at December
31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, consists of the ALLL, which is presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the
RUFC, which is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ALLL amounted to 1.76% of loans and leases
held for investment at December 31, 2012 (or 1.70% excluding covered loans), compared to 2.10% (or 2.05% excluding covered loans)
at December 31, 2011. The decline in the ALLL reflects continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, especially
in the commercial portfolio segment due to improvement in risk-grade migration trends and reductions in higher-risk CRE loans.
The ratio of the ALLL to NPLs held for investment, excluding covered loans, was 1.37x at December 31, 2012 compared to 1.13x at
December 31, 2011.

BB&T’s net charge-offs totaled $1.3 billion for
2012, compared to $1.7 billion in 2011. Included in net charge-offs for 2012 and 2011 was $34 million and $66 million, respectively,
of charge-offs related to covered loans. BB&T’s net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases was 1.14%
(or 1.15% excluding covered loans) for 2012, compared to 1.57% (or 1.59% excluding covered loans), in 2011. Net charge-offs for
2011 included $87 million of losses on the sale of problem loans in connection with management’s NPA disposition strategy.
Excluding these charge-offs, the adjusted net charge-off ratio would have been 1.50% in 2011. Net charge-offs decreased in most
lending portfolios, including a 24.7% decrease in CRE – other, a 46.2% decrease in CRE – residential ADC and a 49.6%
reduction in residential mortgage net charge-offs. Net charge-offs for the commercial and industrial and other lending subsidiaries
portfolios increased 8.5% and 20.6%, respectively. Management expects net charge-offs to approximate 1.00% in the first quarter
of 2013 and trend lower throughout the remainder of the year.



Refer to Note 4 “Allowance for Credit Losses”
in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional disclosures.

The following table presents an estimated allocation of the
ALLL at the end of each of the last five years. This allocation of the ALLL is calculated on an approximate basis and is not necessarily
indicative of future losses or allocations. The entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category

Funding Activities

Deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and
investing activities. Scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities
also provide a stable source of funds. FHLB advances, other secured borrowings, Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed
funds, as well as longer-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. BB&T’s
funding activities are monitored and governed through BB&T’s overall asset/liability management process, which is further
discussed in the “Market Risk Management” section in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” herein. Following is a brief description of the various sources of funds used by BB&T.

Deposits

Deposits are attracted principally from clients within BB&T’s
branch network through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments to individuals and businesses, including noninterest-bearing
checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, CDs and individual retirement
accounts. Deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit
and service charge schedules. Interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) the interest rates
offered by competitors, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative
sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. Deposits are attractive sources of
funding because of their



stability and relative cost. Deposits are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship
and provide opportunities to cross-sell other BB&T services.

Total deposits at December 31, 2012, were $133.1 billion,
an increase of $8.1 billion, or 6.5%, compared to year-end 2011. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $32.5 billion at December
31, 2012, an increase of $6.8 billion, or 26.4%, from December 31, 2011. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits was broad
based in nature, with increases in deposits from personal, business and public funds clients. Interest checking and money market
and savings accounts increased $3.7 billion, or 5.6% compared to the prior year, while certificates and other time deposits declined
$2.3 billion, or 6.7%, during that same time period. For the year ended December 31, 2012, total deposits averaged $127.6
billion, an increase of $15.3 billion, or 13.6%, compared to 2011. Management currently expects more modest deposit growth in the
first quarter of 2013.

The following table presents BB&T’s average deposits
for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, segregated by major category:

The overall mix of deposits improved during 2012, with average
noninterest-bearing deposits representing 22.7% of average total deposits during 2012, compared to 20.4% during 2011. Deposit mix
was also positively impacted by certificates and other time deposits, which represented 24.8% of average total deposits during
2012, down from 25.7% of average total deposits during 2011. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.43% for 2012,
compared to 0.68% in the prior year. Management expects that deposit costs will continue to trend downward in 2013.

The following table provides information regarding the scheduled
maturities of time deposits that are $100,000 and greater at December 31, 2012:

Short-term Borrowings

BB&T also uses
various types of short-term borrowings in meeting funding needs. While deposits remain the primary source for funding loan
originations, management uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other balance sheet
management purposes. Short-term borrowings were 1.9% of total funding on average in 2012 as compared to 3.2% in 2011. See
Note 8 “Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Short-Term Borrowed Funds” in
the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for further disclosure. The types of short-term
borrowings that have been, or may be, used by the Company include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase
agreements, master notes, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury tax and loan deposit notes and short-term bank notes. All of
BB&T’s securities sold under repurchase agreements are reflected as collateralized borrowings on the balance sheet.
Short-term borrowings at the end of 2012 were $2.9 billion, a decrease of $702 million, or 19.7%, compared to year-



end 2011.
Average short-term borrowings totaled $3.4 billion during 2012 compared to $5.2 billion last year, a decrease of 34.3%. The
decline in the balances during 2012 primarily reflects the strong deposit growth described previously.

The following table summarizes certain pertinent information
for the past three years with respect to BB&T’s short-term borrowings:

Long-term Debt

BB&T uses long-term debt to provide both funding and,
to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. During 2012, long-term debt represented 11.6% of average total funding, compared to 13.7%
during 2011. At December 31, 2012, long-term debt totaled $19.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion compared to year-end 2011.
The average cost of long-term debt was 3.02% in 2012, compared to 3.40% in 2011. See Note 10 “Long-Term Debt” in the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for further disclosure.

BB&T’s long-term debt consists primarily of FHLB
advances, which represented 47.1% of total outstanding long-term debt at December 31, 2012; senior notes of BB&T, which
represented 31.6% of the year-end balance; subordinated notes of BB&T, which represented 11.3% of the year-end balance; and
subordinated notes of Branch Bank, which represented 6.4% of total outstanding long-term debt at December 31, 2012. FHLB advances
are cost-effective long-term funding sources that provide BB&T with the flexibility to structure the debt in a manner that
aids in the management of interest rate risk and liquidity.

The decrease in long-term
debt reflects the redemption of $3.3 billion of junior subordinated debt and the maturity of $1.0 billion in senior debt. The redemption
of the junior subordinated debt was initiated based on the early redemption provisions of the related trust preferred securities
due to the fact that they will no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment.

These decreases in long-term
debt were partially offset by the issuance of $2.3 billion of senior and subordinated notes with interest rates ranging from 1.45%
to 3.95%.

Shareholders’ Equity

Shareholders’ equity totaled $21.2 billion at December 31,
2012, an increase of $3.7 billion, or 21.4%, from year-end 2011. BB&T’s book value per common share at December 31,
2012 was $27.21, compared to $24.98 at December 31, 2011.

The increase in shareholders’ equity during 2012 includes
$2.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of Tier 1 qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. See Note 11 “Shareholders’
Equity” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for further disclosure. In addition, shareholders’
equity increased $1.4 billion due to BB&T’s earnings available to common shareholders retained after dividends declared,
and $113 million as a result of the issuance of additional shares and other transactions in connection with BB&T’s equity-based
compensation plans, 401(k) plan and dividend reinvestment plan. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased $154 million.
The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income was primarily due to a $335 million after-tax increase in the value of the
available for sale securities



portfolio, partially offset by declines of $111 million related to pensions and other post-retirement
benefit plans and $61 million related to an increase in amounts attributable to the FDIC under loss share agreements.

BB&T’s tangible book value per common share at
December 31, 2012 was $17.52 compared to $16.73 at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, measures of tangible
capital were not required by the regulators and, therefore, were considered non-GAAP measures. Refer to the section titled “Capital”
herein for a discussion of how BB&T calculates and uses these measures in the evaluation of the Company.

Risk Management

In the normal course of business BB&T encounters inherent
risk in its business activities. Risk is managed on a decentralized basis with risk decisions made as closely as possible to where
the source of risk occurs. Centrally, risk oversight is managed at the corporate level through oversight, policies and reporting.
The principal types of inherent risk include regulatory, credit, liquidity, market, operational, reputation and strategic risks.

Regulatory risk

Regulatory risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or reputation
arising from violations of, or nonconformance with current and changing laws, regulations, supervisory guidance, regulatory expectations,
or the rules, standards, or codes of conduct of self regulatory organizations.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from
the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation with
BB&T or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower,
obligor, or counterparty. Credit risk arises when BB&T funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through
actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off the balance sheet. Credit risk also occurs when the credit quality
of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates.

BB&T has established the following general practices
to manage credit risk:

·

limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;

·

establishing a process for credit approval accountability;

·

careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;

·

ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;

·

continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and

·

periodically reevaluating the bank’s strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions
change.

The following discussion presents the principal types of
lending conducted by BB&T and describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of BB&T’s lending
function.

Underwriting Approach

Recognizing that the loan portfolio is a primary source of
profitability and risk, proper loan underwriting is critical to BB&T’s long-term financial success. BB&T’s
underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that ensure credit relationships
conform to BB&T’s risk philosophy. Provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to
evaluate new loans and loan renewals:

·

Cash flow and debt service coverage

—cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that
loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower’s cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources.

·

Secondary sources of repayment

—alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as
they are liquid, can be easily accessed and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.



·

Value of any underlying collateral

—loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. Because an analysis
of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify
loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower’s normal cash flows.

·

Overall creditworthiness of the customer, taking into account the customer’s relationships, both past and current,
with BB&T and other lenders

—BB&T’s success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships
with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.

·

Level of equity invested in the transaction

—in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion
of their own funds prior to any loan advances.

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio

The commercial loan and lease portfolio represents the largest
category of the Company’s total loan portfolio. BB&T’s commercial lending program is generally targeted to serve
small-to-middle market businesses with sales of $250 million or less. In addition, BB&T’s Corporate Banking Group provides
lending solutions to large corporate clients. Traditionally, lending to small and mid-sized businesses has been among BB&T’s
strongest market segments.

Commercial and small business loans are primarily originated
through BB&T’s Community Bank. In accordance with the Company’s lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed
underwriting process, which incorporates BB&T’s underwriting approach, procedures and evaluations described above. Commercial
loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate or LIBOR. Commercial loans are
individually monitored and reviewed for any possible deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. Approximately
90% of BB&T’s commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories and other types of collateral.

Direct Retail Loan Portfolio

The direct retail loan portfolio primarily consists of a
wide variety of loan products offered through BB&T’s branch network. Various types of secured and unsecured loans are
marketed to qualifying existing clients and to other creditworthy candidates in BB&T’s market area. The vast majority
of direct retail loans are secured by first or second liens on residential real estate and include both closed-end home equity
loans and revolving home equity lines of credit. Direct retail loans are subject to the same rigorous lending policies and procedures
as described above for commercial loans and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that ensure consistency with the
Company’s risk philosophy.

Sales Finance Loan Portfolio

The sales finance category primarily includes secured indirect
installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. Such loans are originated
through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the BB&T market area. These loans are relatively homogenous
and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. Sales finance loans are subject
to the same rigorous lending policies and procedures as described above for commercial loans and are underwritten with note amounts
and credit limits that ensure consistency with the Company’s risk philosophy. In addition to its normal underwriting due
diligence, BB&T uses application systems and “scoring systems” to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in
its sales finance portfolio. Also included in the sales finance category are commercial lines, serviced by the Dealer Finance Department,
to finance dealer wholesale inventory (“Floor Plan Lines”) for resale to consumers. Floor Plan Lines are underwritten
by commercial loan officers in compliance with the same rigorous lending policies described above for commercial loans. In addition,
Floor Plan Lines are subject to intensive monitoring and oversight to ensure quality and to mitigate risk, including from fraud.

Revolving Credit Loan Portfolio

The revolving credit portfolio comprises the outstanding
balances on credit cards and BB&T’s checking account overdraft protection product, Constant Credit. BB&T markets
credit cards to its existing banking client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of
mass marketing. Such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed.

Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio

Branch Bank offers various types of fixed- and
adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. BB&T primarily
originates conforming mortgage loans and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for owner-occupied
properties. Conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by FNMA
and FHLMC. They are generally collateralized by one-to-



four-family residential real estate, typically have
loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. Additionally,
BB&T’s Direct Retail Lending group provides home equity loans that can increase the loan-to-collateral value to 90%
or less for certain borrowers.

Risks associated with the mortgage lending function include
interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary
mortgage market and an effective MSR hedging process. Borrower risk is lessened through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage
insurance. The right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. Management
believes that the retention of mortgage servicing is a primary relationship driver in retail banking and a vital part of management’s
strategy to establish profitable long-term customer relationships and offer high quality client service. BB&T also purchases
residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. The loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to the
same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.

Other Lending Subsidiaries Portfolio

BB&T’s other lending subsidiaries portfolio consists
of loans originated through six LOBs that provide specialty finance alternatives to consumers and businesses including: dealer-based
financing of equipment for small businesses and consumers, commercial equipment leasing and finance, direct and indirect consumer
finance, insurance premium finance, indirect nonprime automobile finance, and full-service commercial mortgage banking. BB&T
offers these services to bank clients as well as nonbank clients within and outside BB&T’s primary geographic market
area.

BB&T’s other lending subsidiaries adhere to the
same overall underwriting approach as the commercial and consumer lending portfolio and also utilize automated credit scoring to
assist with underwriting credit risk. The majority of these loans are relatively homogenous and no single loan is individually
significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. The majority of the loans are secured by real estate, automobiles,
equipment or unearned insurance premiums. As of December 31, 2012, included in the other lending subsidiaries portfolio are
loans to nonprime borrowers of approximately $3.6 billion, or 3.0% of the total BB&T loan and lease portfolio. Of these, approximately
$262 million are residential real estate loans.

Covered Loan Portfolio

BB&T has $3.3 billion of loans covered by loss sharing
agreements with the FDIC, which are primarily CRE and residential mortgage loans. Refer to Note 3 “Loans and Leases”
in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this report for additional disclosures related to BB&T’s
covered loans.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk to ongoing operations arising
from the inability to accommodate liability maturities, deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth, or meet contractual obligations
when they come due. For additional information concerning BB&T’s management of liquidity risk, see the “Liquidity”
section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” herein.

Market risk

Market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from
changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments due to changes in the level, volatility,
or correlations among financial market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, or other
relevant rates or prices. For additional information concerning BB&T’s management of market risk, see the “Market
Risk Management” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” herein.

Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk,
which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect
company-owned assets.

Reputation risk

Reputation risk is the risk to earnings, capital, enterprise
value, the BB&T brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived,
regarding BB&T’s business practices, products and services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by BB&T,
its representatives, or its partners. Reputation risk may impact BB&T’s clients, employees, communities or shareholders,
and is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly.



Strategic risk

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, enterprise
value, and to the achievement of BB&T’s Vision, Mission, Purpose, and business objectives that arises from BB&T’s
business strategy, adverse business decisions, improper or ineffective implementation of decisions, or lack of responsiveness
to changes in business environment. Strategic risk is a function of the compatibility of BB&T’s strategic goals, the
business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against these goals, and the quality of implementation.

Risk Governance

The management of risk has always been an enterprise-wide
initiative at BB&T. It is part of BB&T’s mission statement that risk is managed to optimize the long-term return
to shareholders, while providing a safe and sound investment.

The Chief Risk Officer leads the RMO, which designs, organizes
and manages BB&T’s risk framework. The management of risk begins at the business level through risk identification and
management programs. The RMO is responsible for ensuring effective risk management oversight, measurement, monitoring, reporting
and consistency of controls.

Market Risk Management

The effective management of market risk is essential to achieving
BB&T’s strategic financial objectives. As a financial institution, BB&T’s most significant market risk exposure
is interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also includes product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility
risk in BB&T’s lines of business. The primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize any adverse effect
that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets
recorded at fair value. Market Risk Management also performs the enterprise-wide IPV function.

Interest Rate Market Risk (Other than Trading)

BB&T actively manages market risk associated with asset
and liability portfolios with a focus on the strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and management of appropriate maturity
mixes of assets and liabilities. The goal of these activities is the development of appropriate maturity and repricing opportunities
in BB&T’s portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce reasonably consistent net interest income during periods
of changing interest rates. These portfolios are analyzed for proper fixed-rate and variable-rate mixes under various interest
rate scenarios.

The asset/liability management process is designed to achieve
relatively stable NIM and assure liquidity by coordinating the volumes, maturities or repricing opportunities of earning assets,
deposits and borrowed funds. Among other things, this process gives consideration to prepayment trends related to securities, loans
and leases and certain deposits that have no stated maturity. Prepayment assumptions are developed using a combination of market
data and internal historical prepayment experience for residential mortgage-related loans and securities, and internal historical
prepayment experience for client deposits with no stated maturity and loans that are not residential mortgage related. These assumptions
are subject to monthly back-testing, and are adjusted as deemed necessary to reflect changes in interest rates relative to the
reference rate of the underlying assets or liabilities. On a monthly basis, BB&T evaluates the accuracy of its interest rate
forecast simulation model, which includes an evaluation of its prepayment assumptions, to ensure that all significant assumptions
inherent in the model appropriately reflect changes in the interest rate environment and related trends in prepayment activity.
It is the responsibility of the MRLCC to determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, as well as to ensure an adequate level of liquidity and capital, within the context of corporate performance goals.
The MRLCC also sets policy guidelines and establishes long-term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity.
The MRLCC meets regularly to review BB&T’s interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective
market and business conditions, and adopts funding and balance sheet management strategies that are intended to ensure that the
potential impact on earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is within acceptable standards.

BB&T uses derivatives primarily to manage economic risk
related to securities, commercial loans, MSRs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. BB&T
also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients. As of December 31, 2012, BB&T had derivative financial
instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $73.3 billion, with a net fair value of $13 million. See Note 19 “Derivative
Financial Instruments” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” herein for additional disclosures.

The majority of BB&T’s assets and liabilities are
monetary in nature and, therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments
in fixed assets or inventories. Fluctuations in interest rates and actions of the FRB to regulate the availability and cost of
credit have a greater effect on a financial institution’s profitability than do



the effects of higher costs for goods and
services. Through its balance sheet management function, which is monitored by the MRLCC, management believes that BB&T is
positioned to respond to changing needs for liquidity, changes in interest rates and inflationary trends.

Management uses the Simulation to measure the sensitivity
of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. The Simulation model projects net interest income and interest rate risk for
a rolling two-year period of time. The Simulation takes into account the current contractual agreements that BB&T has made
with its customers on deposits, borrowings, loans, investments and commitments to enter into those transactions. Furthermore, the
Simulation considers the impact of expected customer behavior. Management monitors BB&T’s interest sensitivity by means
of a model that incorporates current volumes, average rates earned and paid, and scheduled maturities and payments of asset and
liability portfolios, together with multiple scenarios that include projected prepayments, repricing opportunities and anticipated
volume growth. Using this information, the model projects earnings based on projected portfolio balances under multiple interest
rate scenarios. This level of detail is needed to simulate the effect that changes in interest rates and portfolio balances may
have on the earnings of BB&T. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but management
believes that it provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses
such as static or dynamic gap. In addition to Simulation analysis, BB&T uses EVE analysis to focus on projected changes in
capital given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also allows BB&T to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside
the analysis window contained in the Simulation model. The EVE model is a discounted cash flow of the entire portfolio of BB&T’s
assets, liabilities, and derivatives instruments. The difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities
is defined as the economic value of BB&T’s equity.

The asset/liability management process requires a number
of key assumptions. Management determines the most likely outlook for the economy and interest rates by analyzing external factors,
including published economic projections and data, the effects of likely monetary and fiscal policies, as well as any enacted or
prospective regulatory changes. BB&T’s current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and
projected growth, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance are also considered. This data is combined
with various interest rate scenarios to provide management with the information necessary to analyze interest sensitivity and to
aid in the development of strategies to reach performance goals.

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes
in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next twelve months assuming a gradual change in interest
rates as described below. Key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mortgage-related assets,
cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing, deposit sensitivity, customer preferences
and capital plans. The resulting change in net interest income reflects the level of sensitivity that interest-sensitive income
has in relation to changing interest rates.

The MRLCC has established parameters related to interest
sensitivity that prescribe a maximum negative impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In the event
the results of the Simulation model fall outside the established parameters, management will make recommendations to the MRLCC
on the most appropriate response given the current economic forecast. The following parameters and interest rate scenarios are
considered BB&T’s primary measures of interest rate risk:

·

Maximum negative impact on net interest income of 2% for the next
12 months assuming a linear change in interest rates totaling 100 basis points over four months followed by a flat interest rate
scenario for the remaining eight month period.

·

Maximum negative impact on net interest income of 4% for the next
12 months assuming a linear change of 200 basis points over eight months followed by a flat interest rate scenario for the remaining
four month period.



These “interest rate ramp” limits are considered
BB&T’s primary measure of interest rate risk. If a rate change of 200 basis points cannot be modeled due to a low level
of rates, a proportional limit applies. Management currently only models a negative 25 basis point decline because larger declines
would have resulted in a Federal funds rate of less than zero. In a situation such as this, the maximum negative impact on net
interest income is adjusted on a proportional basis. Regardless of the proportional limit, the negative risk exposure limit will
be the greater of 1% or the proportional limit.

Management has also established a maximum negative impact
on net interest income of 4% for an immediate 100 basis points change in rates and 8% for an immediate 200 basis points change
in rates. These “interest rate shock” limits are designed to create an outer band of acceptable risk based upon a significant
and immediate change in rates.

Management must also consider how the balance sheet and interest
rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during
the current economic downturn. Much of this liquidity increase has been due to a significant increase in noninterest-bearing demand
deposits. Consistent with the industry, Branch Bank has seen a significant increase in this funding source. The behavior of these
deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of BB&T. A loss of these
deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of BB&T’s balance sheet as the company increases interest-bearing
funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source.

Beta represents the correlation between overall market interest
rates and the rates paid by BB&T on interest-bearing deposits. BB&T applies an average beta of approximately 80% to its
managed rate deposits for determining its interest rate sensitivity. Managed rate deposits are high beta, premium money market
and interest checking accounts, which attract significant client funds when needed to support balance sheet growth. BB&T regularly
conducts sensitivity on other key variables to determine the impact they could have on the interest rate risk position. This discipline
informs management judgment and allows BB&T to evaluate the likely impact on its balance sheet management strategies due to
a more extreme variation in a key assumption than expected.

The following table shows the effect that the loss of demand
deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits would have on BB&T’s interest-rate sensitivity position.
For purposes of this analysis, BB&T modeled the beta at 100%.

The base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at December 31, 2012 as presented in the preceding table.

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes
in interest rates would have on EVE. Key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mortgage-related
and other assets, cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing and deposit sensitivity.
The resulting change in the EVE reflects the level of sensitivity that EVE has in relation to changing interest rates.

Market Risk from Trading Activities

BB&T also manages market risk from trading activities
which consists of acting as a financial intermediary to provide its customers access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities
markets. Trading market risk is managed through the use of statistical and non-statistical risk measures and limits, with overall
firm limits established through Board Policy. BB&T utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across
its covered trading lines of business. This methodology uses one year of historical data to estimate economic outcomes for a one-day
time horizon at a 99% confidence level.

The average VaR for the year ended December 31, 2012 was
less than $1 million. The maximum daily VaR was approximately $3 million, and the low daily VaR was less than $1 million during
the same period.

Liquidity

Liquidity represents BB&T’s continuing ability
to meet funding needs, primarily deposit withdrawals, timely repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan
commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale, many
other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing
capacity in national money markets, growing core deposits, the repayment of loans and the capability to securitize or package loans
for sale. BB&T monitors key liquidity metrics at both the Parent Company and Branch Bank.

Parent Company

The purpose of the Parent Company is to serve as the capital
financing vehicle for the operating subsidiaries. The assets of the Parent Company consist primarily of cash on deposit with Branch
Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, accounts receivable from subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous
assets. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are principal and interest payments on long-term debt. The main sources
of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are for investments in subsidiaries,
advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common stock and interest and principal
payments due on long-term debt.

The primary source of funds used for Parent Company cash
requirements was dividends received from subsidiaries, which totaled $1.8 billion during 2012. In addition, the Parent Company
issued $2.0 billion of senior notes and $300 million of subordinated notes during 2012, repaid $1.5 billion of maturing long-term
debt and redeemed all of its junior subordinated debt to unconsolidated trusts. Funds raised through master note agreements with
commercial clients are placed in a note receivable at Branch Bank primarily for its use in meeting short-term funding needs and,
to a lesser extent, to support the short-term temporary cash needs of the Parent Company. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, master
note balances totaled $37 million and $296 million, respectively.

The Parent Company had ten issues of senior notes outstanding
totaling $6.0 billion and four issues of subordinated notes outstanding totaling $2.2 billion at December 31, 2012.

Liquidity at the Parent Company is more susceptible to market
disruptions. BB&T prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected contractual
cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities without
the benefit of any new cash infusions. Generally, BB&T maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of contractual
cash outflows. In determining the buffer, BB&T considers cash for common dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, being
a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions which may limit access
to the credit markets.



As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Parent Company had 35 months and 23 months, respectively, of cash
on hand to satisfy projected contractual cash outflows as described above.

Branch Bank

Branch Bank has several major sources of funding to meet
its liquidity requirements, including access to capital markets through issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes and institutional
CDs, access to the FHLB system, dealer repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements with commercial clients, access to the overnight
and term Federal funds markets, use of a Cayman branch facility, access to retail brokered CDs and a borrower in custody program
with the FRB for the discount window. As of December 31, 2012, BB&T has approximately $53 billion of secured borrowing capacity,
which represents approximately 290% of one year wholesale funding maturities.

BB&T also monitors the ability to meet customer demand
for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates BB&T’s
funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and non-client rate-sensitive funding. In addition, management
also evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs
against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Branch Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position, management maintains a liquid
asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unpledged securities. The Company has established a policy that the liquid asset
buffer would be a minimum of 5% of total assets, but intends to maintain the ratio well in excess of this level. As of December
31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, BB&T’s liquid asset buffer was 11.1% and 13.5%, respectively, of total assets.

BB&T’s and Branch Bank’s ability to raise
funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies’ views of BB&T’s and Branch Bank’s credit
quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Management meets with the rating agencies on a routine basis to discuss the current outlook
for BB&T and Branch Bank. The ratings for BB&T and Branch Bank by the four major rating agencies are detailed in the table
below.

BB&T and Branch Bank have Contingency Funding Plans designed
to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet their ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of
a liquidity contraction. These plans are designed to examine and quantify the organization’s liquidity under various “stress”
scenarios. Additionally, the plans provide a framework for management and other critical personnel to follow in the event of a
liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The plans address authority for activation and decision making, liquidity
options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. The liquidity options available to
management could include seeking secured funding, asset sales, and under the most extreme scenarios, curtailing new loan originations.

Management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate
to meet BB&T’s current requirements and plans for continued growth. See Note 5 “Premises and Equipment,”
Note 10 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies”



in the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments
and obligations.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities,
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, And Related Party Transactions

The following table presents, as of December 31, 2012, BB&T’s
significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date. The payment amounts represent those amounts contractually
due to the recipient. The table excludes liabilities recorded where management cannot reasonably estimate the timing of any payments
that may be required in connection with these liabilities. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in Note
15 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Includes accrued interest and future contractual interest obligations.  Variable rate payments are based upon the rate in effect at December 31, 2012.

BB&T’s significant commitments include investments
in affordable housing and historic building rehabilitation projects throughout its market area and private equity funds. Refer
to Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and to Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies” in
the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of these commitments.

In addition, BB&T enters into derivative contracts to
manage various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by
reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments
based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date. Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional
amounts, which only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and are not a measure of financial risk.
Therefore, the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 do not represent the amounts that may
ultimately be paid under these contracts. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 1 “Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 19 “Derivative Financial Instruments” in the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.”

In the ordinary course of business, BB&T indemnifies
its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from litigation. BB&T also issues
standard representation and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities
and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnifications provide similar indemnifications to BB&T.
Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees
would materially change the financial condition or results of operations of BB&T.

BB&T holds public funds in certain states that do not
require 100% collateralization on public fund bank deposits. In these states, should the failure of another public fund depository
institution result in a loss for the public entity, the resulting shortfall would have to be absorbed on a pro-rata basis by the
remaining financial institutions holding public funds in that state.

As a member of the FHLB, BB&T is required to maintain
a minimum investment in capital stock. The board of directors of the FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the
event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase
in the minimum investment requirements outside of



specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
Because the extent of any obligation to increase BB&T’s investment in the FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence of
a future event, potential future payments to the FHLB are not determinable.

In the normal course of business, BB&T is also a party
to financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk. Such financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain contractual agreements, including standby letters of credit and financial
guarantee arrangements. Further discussion of these commitments is included in Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies”
in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

BB&T’s significant commitments and obligations
are summarized in the accompanying table. Not all of the commitments presented in the table will be used, thus the actual cash
requirements are likely to be significantly less than the amounts reported.

The Company may extend credit to its officers and directors
in the ordinary course of business. These loans are made under substantially the same terms as comparable third-party lending arrangements
and are in compliance with applicable banking regulations.

Capital

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management
priority and is monitored on a regular basis. BB&T’s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide
adequate capital to support BB&T’s risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility
to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit
ratings for BB&T and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders.

Management regularly monitors the capital position of BB&T
on both a consolidated and bank level basis. Capital ratios are determined using operating forecasts and plans as well as stressed
scenarios. In this regard, management’s overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of the operating
capital guidelines, which are above the regulatory “well capitalized” levels. Management has recently implemented stressed
capital ratio minimum guidelines to evaluate whether capital levels are sufficient to withstand the impact of plausible, severe
economic downturns or bank-specific events. The following table presents the minimum capital ratios:

Payments of cash dividends to BB&T’s shareholders
and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. In addition, management closely monitors
the Parent Company’s double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders’ equity) with
the intention of maintaining the ratio below 125%. The active management of the subsidiaries’ equity capital, as described
above, is the process used to manage this important driver of Parent Company liquidity and is a key element in the management of
BB&T’s capital position.

The capital of BB&T’s subsidiaries is regularly
monitored to determine if the levels that management believes are the most beneficial and efficient for their operations are maintained.
Management intends to maintain capital at Branch Bank at levels that will result in these subsidiaries being classified as “well-capitalized”
for regulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is



management’s intent to maintain Branch Bank’s capital at levels that result
in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile.
If the capital levels of Branch Bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the Parent Company,
subject to regulatory and other operating considerations, in the form of special dividend payments.

While nonrecurring events or management decisions may result
in the Company temporarily falling below its minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios, it is management’s intent
through capital planning to return to these targeted minimums within a reasonable period of time. Such temporary decreases below
these minimums are not considered an infringement of BB&T’s overall capital policy provided the Company and Branch Bank
remain “well-capitalized.”

Risk-based capital ratios, which include Tier
1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Common Equity, are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement
of capital and risk-weighted assets. BB&T reevaluated its process related to calculating risk-weighted assets and
determined that certain adjustments, primarily related to the presentation of certain unfunded lending commitments, were
required in order to conform to regulatory guidance.  These adjustments resulted in an increase to risk-weighted assets and a
decrease in BB&T’s risk-based capital ratios under the Basel I regulatory guidance. These adjustments had a minimal
impact on BB&T’s Basel III ratio as calculated based on the June 7, 2012 NPR.

BB&T’s Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.3% at
December 31, 2012. The acquisitions of Crump Insurance and BankAtlantic during the second and
third quarters of 2012, respectively, had a negative impact on regulatory capital, as a result of the intangible assets associated
with those acquisitions. This negative regulatory capital impact was offset by strong capital generation during 2012.

BB&T regularly performs stress testing on its capital
levels and is required to periodically submit the company’s capital plans to the banking regulators. Management’s capital
deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on organic growth, dividends, strategic opportunities and share repurchases.

Tier 1 common equity ratios are non-GAAP measures. BB&T uses the Tier 1 common equity definition used in the SCAP assessment
to calculate these ratios. Management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find
them useful in their analysis of the Company. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures
that may be presented by other companies.

(3)

Risk-weighted assets are determined based on regulatory capital requirements.

As of December 31, 2012, management currently estimates the
Tier 1 common ratio under the currently proposed U.S. Basel III standards to be 7.9%.
The proposed U.S. Basel III standards incorporate changes to the risk-weighting of loans secured by residential properties, requiring
consideration of loan-to-value ratios in determining risk-weighting. Management’s estimate of the Tier 1 common ratio under
the proposed U.S. Basel III standards does not include any mitigation strategies to improve capital levels, which management believes
will have a significant positive impact on this measure. The following table presents the calculation of the Tier 1 common equity
ratio under the proposed Basel III guidelines.

The estimated Basel III capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure and reflects adjustments for the related elements as proposed by regulatory authorities, which are subject to change.  BB&T management uses this measure to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find it useful in their analysis of the Company.  This capital measure is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies.

Fourth Quarter Results

Consolidated net income available to common shareholders
for the fourth quarter of 2012 totaling $506 million was up 29.4% compared to $391 million earned during the same period in 2011.
On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $0.71, up 29.1% compared to $0.55 for the same
period in 2011. BB&T’s results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2012 produced an annualized return on average
assets of 1.20% and an annualized return on average common shareholders’ equity of 10.51% compared to prior year ratios of
0.93% and 8.76%, respectively.

Total revenues were $2.5 billion for the fourth quarter of
2012, up $122 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in total revenues included $24 million of higher taxable-equivalent
net interest income, which was primarily driven by a 21.4% decrease in funding costs from the same quarter of the prior year. NIM
was 3.84%, down 18 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, which reflects covered loan run-off and lower yields on
new loans and securities partially offset by lower funding costs. Noninterest income increased $98 million, primarily attributable
to a $108 million increase in insurance income and a $96 million increase in mortgage banking income, offset by a $103 million
decrease in net securities gains.

Noninterest expenses were $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter
of 2012, a decrease of $130 million, or 8.0%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease in noninterest expenses was
primarily due to a $298 million decrease in foreclosed property expense, which was the result of losses and writedowns in the prior
year quarter when management implemented a more aggressive approach to reduce foreclosed real estate. This decrease was partially
offset by a $144 million increase in personnel expense primarily due to the Crump Insurance and BankAtlantic acquisitions, increased
production-related incentives and commissions and certain other increases in salaries and benefits.



The provision for credit losses, excluding covered loans,
for the fourth quarter of 2012 totaled $256 million, compared to $223 million for fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in the
provision for credit losses reflects a smaller reserve release in the fourth quarter of 2012 than was recorded in the same quarter
of the prior year. Net charge-offs, excluding covered loans, for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $85 million lower than the fourth
quarter of 2011 reflecting improved credit quality. NPAs declined $914 million, or 37.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.

The provision for income taxes was $207 million for the fourth
quarter of 2012 compared to $84 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2012 was
27.4% compared to 17.4% for the prior year’s fourth quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to
higher levels of pre-tax earnings relative to permanent tax differences in 2012 compared to 2011.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting and Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management of BB&T is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. BB&T’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with
GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of BB&T’s
management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material impact on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework”
promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the “COSO”
criteria. Based on this evaluation under the COSO criteria, management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2012.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the management
of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, carried out an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

There was no change in the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012 that has materially affected or is likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2012, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BB&T Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this
Report for terms used throughout the consolidated financial statements and related notes of this Form 10-K.

BB&T is a financial holding company organized under the
laws of North Carolina. BB&T conducts operations through its principal bank subsidiary, Branch Bank and its nonbank subsidiaries.

The accounting and reporting policies of BB&T and its
subsidiaries are in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting
guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The following is a summary of BB&T’s more significant accounting
policies.

Nature of Operations

Branch Bank has offices in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida,
Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, Texas, Washington D.C and Indiana. Branch Bank
provides a wide range of banking services to individuals and businesses, and offers a variety of loans to businesses and consumers.
Such loans are made primarily to individuals residing in the market areas described above or to businesses located within BB&T’s
geographic footprint. Branch Bank also markets a wide range of deposit services to individuals, businesses and public entities.
Branch Bank offers, either directly, or through its subsidiaries, lease financing to businesses and municipal governments; factoring;
discount brokerage services, annuities and mutual funds; life insurance, property and casualty insurance, health insurance and
commercial general liability insurance on an agency basis and through a wholesale insurance brokerage operation; insurance premium
financing; permanent financing arrangements for CRE; loan servicing for third-party investors; direct consumer finance loans to
individuals; trust and retirement services, comprehensive wealth advisory services and association services. BB&T FSB and the
direct nonbank subsidiaries of BB&T provide a variety of financial services including credit card lending, automobile financing,
equipment financing, full-service securities brokerage, asset management and capital markets services.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of BB&T include
the accounts of BB&T Corporation and those subsidiaries that are majority owned by BB&T and over which BB&T exercises
control. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. The results of operations of
companies or assets acquired are included only from the dates of acquisition. All material wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries
are consolidated unless GAAP requires otherwise.

BB&T holds investments in certain legal entities that
are considered VIEs. VIEs are legal entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
independently finance its activities, or as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the power through voting
or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, or do not have
the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity. Consolidation
of a VIE is required if a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

BB&T evaluates its investments in VIEs to determine if
BB&T is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This evaluation gives appropriate consideration to the design of the entity and
the variability that the entity was designed to pass along, the relative power of each of the parties to the VIE, and to BB&T’s
relative obligation to absorb losses or receive residual returns of the entity, in relation to such obligations and rights held
by other parties to the VIE. BB&T has variable interests in certain entities that were not required to be consolidated, including
affordable housing partnership interests, historic tax credit partnerships, and other partnership interests. Refer to Note 15 for
additional disclosures regarding BB&T’s significant VIEs.

BB&T accounts for unconsolidated partnership and similar
investments using the equity method of accounting. In addition to affordable housing partnerships, which represent the majority
of unconsolidated investments in VIEs, BB&T also has investments in, and future funding commitments to, private equity investments.

BB&T has investments in certain entities for which BB&T
does not have a controlling interest. For these investments, the Company records its portion of income or loss in other noninterest
income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. BB&T periodically evaluates these investments for impairment.



Reclassifications

In certain instances, amounts reported in prior years’
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had
no effect on previously reported cash flows, shareholders’ equity or net income.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible
to significant change include the determination of the ACL, determination of fair value for financial instruments, valuation of
goodwill, intangible assets and other purchase accounting related adjustments, benefit plan obligations and expenses, and tax assets,
liabilities and expense.

Business Combinations

BB&T accounts for all business combinations using the
acquisition method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the accounts of an acquired entity are included with the acquirer’s
accounts as of the date of acquisition with any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (including
identifiable intangibles) capitalized as goodwill.

To consummate an acquisition, BB&T typically issues common
stock and/or pays cash, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of common shares issued is determined based
upon the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition.

In connection with mergers and acquisitions, BB&T may
issue options to purchase shares of its common stock in exchange for options to purchase shares of the acquired entities that are
outstanding at the time the merger is completed. To the extent vested, the options are considered to be part of the purchase price
paid. There is no change in the aggregate intrinsic value of the options issued compared to the intrinsic value of the options
held immediately before the exchange, nor does the ratio of the exercise price per option to the market value per share change.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with banks, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements.
Cash and cash equivalents have maturities of three months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such instruments is considered
a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Securities

BB&T classifies marketable investment securities as held
to maturity, available for sale or trading. Interest income and dividends on securities are recognized in interest income on an
accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized as an adjustment to interest income using the interest method.

Debt securities are classified as held to maturity where
BB&T has both the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These securities are reported at amortized cost.

Debt securities, which may be sold to meet liquidity needs
arising from unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, changes in regulatory capital requirements, or unforeseen changes in
market conditions, are classified as available for sale. Securities available for sale are reported at estimated fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI, net of deferred income taxes, in the shareholders’ equity section of the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Gains or losses realized from the sale of securities available for sale are determined by specific identification
and are included in noninterest income.

BB&T evaluates each held to maturity and available for
sale security in a loss position for OTTI. BB&T considers such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the market
value has been below amortized cost, long term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments, BB&T’s
intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated
recovery of the amortized cost basis. The credit component of an OTTI loss is recognized in earnings and the non-credit component
is recognized in AOCI in situations where BB&T does not intend to sell the security and it is more-likely-than-not that BB&T
will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery.

Trading account securities, which include both debt and equity
securities, are reported at fair value. Unrealized market value adjustments, fees, and realized gains or losses from trading account
activities (determined by specific identification) are



included in noninterest income. Interest income on trading
account securities is included in interest and dividends from other earning assets.

LHFS

BB&T accounts for new originations of prime residential
mortgage and commercial mortgage LHFS at fair value. BB&T accounts for the derivatives used to economically hedge the LHFS
at fair value. The value for LHFS carried at fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities collateralized
by similar types of loans. Direct loan origination fees and costs related to LHFS and accounted for at fair value are not capitalized,
but rather are recorded as mortgage banking income in the case of the direct loan origination fees and primarily personnel expense
in the case of the direct loan origination costs. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking
income. Gains and losses on sales of commercial LHFS are included in other noninterest income.

Loans and Leases

The Company’s accounting methods for loans differ depending
on whether the loans are originated or acquired, and if acquired, whether or not the acquired loans reflect credit deterioration
since the date of origination such that it is probable at the date of acquisition that BB&T will be unable to collect all contractually
required payments.

Originated Loans and Leases

Loans and leases that management has the intent and ability
to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs,
and unamortized fees and costs. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with
the lending process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using methods that approximate
the interest method.

BB&T classifies all loans and leases past due when
the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent. When commercial loans
are placed on nonaccrual status as described below, a charge-off is recorded, as applicable, to decrease the carrying value
of such loans to the estimated recoverable amount. Consumer loans are subject to
mandatory charge-off at a specified delinquency date consistent with regulatory guidelines. As such, consumer loans are
subject to collateral valuation and charge-off, as applicable, when they are moved to nonaccrual status as described
below.

Purchased Loans

Purchased loans are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition
date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded
at the acquisition date.

Acquired loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified
as either purchased impaired or purchased non-impaired. Purchased impaired loans reflect credit deterioration since origination
such that it is probable at acquisition that BB&T will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. For purchased
impaired loans, expected cash flows at the acquisition date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income
over the life of the loans using a level yield method if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable.
Subsequent to the acquisition date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively
as interest income. Decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date are recognized by recording an allowance for loan
losses. For purchased non-impaired loans, the difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at the
acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated life of the loans using a method that approximates
the interest method.

Based on the characteristics of loans acquired in a FDIC-assisted
transaction and the impact of associated loss sharing arrangements, BB&T determined that it was appropriate to apply the expected
cash flows approach described above to all loans acquired in such transactions.

TDRs

Modifications to a borrower’s debt agreement are considered
TDRs if a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties that otherwise
would not be considered. TDRs are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan and may take the form of
modifications made with the stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, other modifications
to the structure of the loan that fall outside of normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in certain limited circumstances
forgiveness of principal or interest. Modifications of covered loans that are part of a pool accounted for as a single asset are
not considered TDRs. TDRs can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accruing status, depending
on the



individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. In circumstances
where the TDR involves charging off a portion of the loan balance, BB&T typically classifies these TDRs as nonaccrual.

In connection with commercial TDRs, the decision to maintain
a loan that has been restructured on accrual status is based on a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s
financial condition and prospects for repayment under the modified terms. This evaluation includes consideration of the borrower’s
current capacity to pay, which among other things may include a review of the borrower’s current financial statements, an
analysis of global cash flow sufficient to pay all debt obligations, and an evaluation of secondary sources of payment from the
client and any guarantors. This evaluation also includes an evaluation of the borrower’s current willingness to pay, which
may include a review of past payment history, an evaluation of the borrower’s willingness to provide information on a timely
basis, and consideration of offers from the borrower to provide additional collateral or guarantor support. The credit evaluation
also reflects consideration of the borrower’s future capacity and willingness to pay, which may include evaluation of cash
flow projections, consideration of the adequacy of collateral to cover all principal and interest and trends indicating improving
profitability and collectability of receivables.

The evaluation of mortgage and consumer loans includes an
evaluation of the client’s debt to income ratio, credit report, property value, loan vintage, and certain other client-specific
factors that impact their ability to make timely principal and interest payments on the loan.

Nonaccrual TDRs may be returned to accrual status based on
a current, well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects for repayment under the
modified terms. This evaluation must include consideration of the borrower’s sustained historical repayment performance for
a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) prior to the date on which the loan is returned to accrual status. Sustained
historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the TDR may be taken into account. In connection with retail TDRs,
a NPL will be returned to accruing status when current as to principal and interest and upon a sustained historical repayment performance
(generally a minimum of six months).

NPAs

NPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property
consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of customers’ loan defaults. BB&T’s policies for
placing loans on nonaccrual status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The majority of commercial
loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible, or generally
when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due, whichever occurs first. Other lending subsidiaries’ loans, which includes
both consumer and commercial loans, are placed on nonaccrual status generally when principal and interest becomes 90 days past
due. Direct retail, mortgage and sales finance loans are placed on nonaccrual status at varying intervals, based on the type of
product, generally when principal and interest becomes between 90 days and 180 days past due. Revolving credit loans are not placed
on nonaccrual but are charged off after they become 150 days past due, with unpaid fees and finance charges reversed against interest
income. Covered loans are considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method.

Certain loans past due 90 days or more may remain on accrual
status if management determines that it does not have concern over the collectibility of principal and interest. Generally, when
loans are placed on nonaccrual status, accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest
payments received thereafter are applied as a reduction to the remaining principal balance as long as concern exists as to the
ultimate collection of the principal. Loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current as
to both principal and interest and concern no longer exists as to the collectability of principal and interest.

Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are subsequently
carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value equals fair value less estimated selling costs. Any
excess of cost over net realizable value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic revaluations
of the collateral underlying impaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The periodic revaluations are generally based on the appraised
value of the property and may include additional liquidity adjustments based upon the expected retention period. BB&T’s
policies require that valuations be updated at least annually and that upon foreclosure, the valuation must not be more than six
months old, otherwise an updated appraisal is required. Routine maintenance costs, other costs of ownership, subsequent declines
in market value and net losses on disposal are included in foreclosed property expense.

ACL

The ACL comprises the ALLL and the RUFC. The ACL represents
management’s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending
commitments at the balance sheet date. The Company determines the ACL based on an ongoing evaluation. This evaluation is inherently
subjective because it requires material



estimates, including the amounts and timing of cash flows
expected to be received on impaired loans. Those estimates are susceptible to significant change. Changes to the ACL are made
by charges to the provision for credit losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loans or lease balances
deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the
ALLL. The methodology used to determine the RUFC is inherently similar to that used to determine the collectively evaluated component
of the ALLL, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default.
While management uses the best information available to establish the ACL, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions
differ substantially from the assumptions used in computing the allowance or, if required by regulators, based upon information
available to them at the time of their examinations.

Accounting standards require the presentation of certain
disclosure information at the portfolio segment level, which represents the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic
methodology to determine its ACL. BB&T concluded that its loan and lease portfolio comprises three portfolio segments; commercial,
retail and covered. The commercial portfolio segment includes CRE, commercial and industrial and other loans originated by certain
other lending subsidiaries, and was identified based on the risk-based approach used to estimate the ALLL for the vast majority
of these loans. The retail portfolio segment includes direct retail lending, revolving credit, mortgage, sales finance and other
loans originated by certain retail-oriented subsidiaries, and was identified based on the delinquency-based approach used to estimate
the allowance for these loans. The covered portfolio segment was identified based on the expected cash flows approach used to estimate
the allowance related to loans acquired subsequent to December 31, 2008.

A portion of BB&T’s ALLL is not allocated to any
specific category of loans. This unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management’s best estimate of the elements
of imprecision and estimation risk inherent in the calculation of the overall allowance. Due to the subjectivity involved in determining
the overall allowance, including the unallocated portion, the portion considered unallocated may fluctuate from period to period
based on management’s evaluation of the factors affecting the assumptions used in calculating the allowance, including historical
loss experience, current economic conditions, industry or borrower concentrations and the status of merged institutions.

The entire amount of the ACL is available to absorb losses
on any loan category or lending-related commitment.

The following provides a description of BB&T’s
accounting policies and methodologies related to each of its portfolio segments:

Commercial

The vast majority of loans in the commercial lending portfolio
are assigned risk grades based on an assessment of conditions that affect the borrower’s ability to meet contractual obligations
under the loan agreement. This process includes reviewing borrowers’ financial information, historical payment experience,
credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each borrower. Risk grades are reviewed on an annual
basis for all credit relationships with total credit exposure of $1 million or more, or at any point management becomes aware of
information affecting the borrowers’ ability to fulfill their obligations. For commercial clients with total credit exposure
less than $1 million, BB&T has developed an automated loan review system to identify and proactively manage accounts with a
higher risk of loss. The “score” produced by this automated system is updated monthly.

On a quarterly basis, BB&T reviews all commercial lending
relationships with outstanding debt of $5 million or more that have been classified as substandard or doubtful. While this review
is largely focused on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, BB&T also considers the capacity and willingness of a
loan’s guarantors to support the debt service on the loan as a secondary source of repayment. When a guarantor exhibits the
documented capacity and willingness to support the loan, BB&T may consider extending the loan maturity and/or temporarily deferring
principal payments if the ultimate collection of both principal and interest is not in question. In these cases, BB&T may not
deem the loan to be impaired due to the documented capacity and willingness of the guarantor to repay the loan. Loans are considered
impaired when the borrower (or guarantor in certain circumstances) does not have the cash flow capacity or willingness to service
the debt according to contractual terms, or it does not appear reasonable to assume that the borrower will continue to pay according
to the contractual agreement. BB&T establishes a specific reserve for each loan that has been deemed impaired based on the
criteria outlined above. The amount of the reserve is based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate, and/or the value of collateral. BB&T has also established a review process related to TDRs and other
impaired loans that are in commercial lending relationships with outstanding debt of less than $5 million at the balance sheet
date. In connection with this process, BB&T establishes reserves related to these loans that are calculated using an expected
cash flow approach. These discounted cash flow analyses incorporate adjustments to future cash flows that reflect management’s
best estimate of the default risk related to TDRs based on a combination of historical experience and management judgment.



BB&T also maintains reserves for collective impairment
that reflect an estimate of losses related to non-impaired commercial loans as of the balance sheet date. Embedded loss estimates
for BB&T’s commercial loan portfolio are based on estimated migration rates, which are estimated based on historical
experience, and current risk mix as indicated by the risk grading process described above. Embedded loss estimates may be adjusted
to reflect current economic conditions and current portfolio trends including credit quality, concentrations, aging of the portfolio,
and significant policy and underwriting changes.

Retail

The majority of the ALLL related to the retail lending portfolio
is calculated on a collective basis using a delinquency-based approach. Embedded loss estimates for BB&T’s retail lending
portfolio are based on estimated migration rates that are developed based on historical experience, and current risk mix as indicated
by prevailing delinquency rates. These estimates may be adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and current portfolio trends.
The remaining portion of the allowance related to the retail lending portfolio relates to loans that have been deemed impaired
based on their classification as a TDR at the balance sheet date. BB&T establishes specific reserves related to these TDRs
using an expected cash flow approach. The allowance for retail TDRs is based on discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate
adjustments to future cash flows that reflect management’s best estimate of the default risk related to TDRs based on a combination
of historical experience and management judgment.

Acquired Loans

Purchased impaired loans and all loans acquired in an FDIC-assisted
transaction are typically aggregated into loan pools based upon common risk characteristics. The ALLL for each loan pool is based
on an analysis that is performed each period to estimate the expected cash flows. To the extent that the expected cash flows of
a loan pool have decreased since the acquisition date, BB&T establishes an allowance for loan losses. For non-FDIC assisted
purchased non-impaired loans, BB&T uses an approach consistent with that described above for originated loans and leases.

Covered Assets and Related FDIC Loss Share Receivable

Assets subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC are
labeled “covered” and include certain loans, securities and other assets.

The FDIC’s obligation to reimburse Branch Bank
for losses with respect to covered assets begins with the first dollar of loss incurred. The terms of the loss sharing
agreement with respect to certain non-agency RMBS provides that Branch Bank will be reimbursed by the FDIC for 95% of any and
all losses. All other covered assets are subject to a stated threshold of $5 billion that provides for the FDIC to reimburse
Branch Bank for (1) 80% of losses incurred up to $5 billion and (2) 95% of losses in excess of $5 billion. Gains and
recoveries on covered assets will offset losses, or be paid to the FDIC, at the applicable loss share percentage at the time
of recovery. The loss sharing agreement applicable to single family residential mortgage loans expires in 2019, and provides
for FDIC loss sharing and Branch Bank reimbursement to the FDIC. The loss sharing agreement applicable to commercial loans
and other covered assets expires in 2014, however, Branch Bank must reimburse the FDIC for realized gains and recoveries
through August 2017. At the conclusion of the loss share period should actual aggregate losses, excluding securities, be less
than an amount determined in accordance with these agreements, BB&T will pay the FDIC a portion of the difference.

The income statement effect of the changes in the FDIC loss
share receivable includes the accretion due to discounting and changes in expected net reimbursements. Decreases in expected net
reimbursements, including the amounts expected to be paid to the FDIC as a result of the aggregate losses calculation, are recognized
in income prospectively over the term of the loss share agreements consistent with the approach taken to recognize increases in
cash flows on covered loans. Increases in expected reimbursements are recognized in income in the same period that the ACL for
the related loans is recognized.

Premises and Equipment

Premises, equipment, capital leases and leasehold improvements
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is stated at cost. In addition, purchased software and
costs of computer software developed for internal use are capitalized provided certain criteria are met. Depreciation and amortization
are computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms, including certain renewals that were deemed probable
at lease inception, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Capitalized leases are amortized by the same methods as
premises and equipment over the estimated useful lives or lease terms, whichever is less. Obligations under capital leases are
amortized using the interest method to allocate payments between principal reduction and interest expense. Rent expense and rental
income on operating leases is recorded using the straight-line method over the appropriate lease terms.



Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements

Securities sold under repurchase agreements generally have
maturities ranging from 1 day to 36 months. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected as collateralized borrowings
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recorded based on the amount of cash received in connection with the borrowing. The
terms of repurchase agreements may require BB&T to provide additional collateral if the fair value of the securities underlying
the borrowings declines during the term of the agreement.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes have been provided when different accounting
methods have been used in determining income for income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized based on future tax consequences attributable to differences arising from the financial statement
carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. In the event of changes in the tax laws, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted in the period of the enactment of those changes, with the cumulative effects included in the current year’s
income tax provision.

Derivative Financial Instruments

A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash
flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. These instruments
include interest rate swaps, caps, floors, collars, financial forwards and futures contracts, swaptions, when-issued securities,
foreign exchange contracts and options written and purchased. BB&T uses derivatives primarily to manage economic risk related
to securities, commercial loans, MSRs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. BB&T also
uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients. The fair value of derivatives in a gain or loss position
is included in other assets or liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

BB&T classifies its derivative financial instruments
as either (1) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recorded asset or liability (“fair value hedge”),
(2) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the cash flows of a recognized asset, liability or forecasted transaction (“cash
flow hedge”), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a subsidiary, or (4) derivatives not designated as hedges. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in current period earnings. BB&T has master netting agreements
with the derivatives dealers with which it does business, but reflects gross assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

BB&T uses the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness.
BB&T documents, both at inception and over the life of the hedge, at least quarterly, its analysis of actual and expected hedge
effectiveness. This analysis includes techniques such as regression analysis and hypothetical derivatives to demonstrate that the
hedge has been, and is expected to be, highly effective in off-setting corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of
the hedged item. For cash flow hedges involving interest rate caps and collars, this analysis also includes consideration of whether
critical terms match, the strike price of the hedging option matches the specified level beyond (or within) which the entity’s
exposure is being hedged, the hedging instrument’s inflows (outflows) at its maturity date completely offset the change in
the hedged transaction’s cash flows for the risk being hedged and the hedging instrument can be exercised only on its contractual
maturity date. For a qualifying fair value hedge, changes in the value of the derivatives that have been highly effective as hedges
are recognized in current period earnings along with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the designated hedged item
attributable to the risk being hedged. For a qualifying cash flow hedge, the portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives
that have been highly effective are recognized in OCI until the related cash flows from the hedged item are recognized in earnings.
For qualifying cash flow hedges involving interest rate caps and collars, the initial fair value of the premium paid is allocated
and recognized in the same future period that the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings.

For either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, ineffectiveness
may be recognized in noninterest income to the extent that changes in the value of the derivative instruments do not perfectly
offset changes in the value of the hedged items. If the hedge ceases to be highly effective, BB&T discontinues hedge accounting
and recognizes the changes in fair value in current period earnings. If a derivative that qualifies as a fair value or cash flow
hedge is terminated or the designation removed, the realized or then unrealized gain or loss is recognized into income over the
life of the hedged item (fair value hedge) or period in which the hedged item affects earnings (cash flow hedge). Immediate recognition
in earnings is required upon sale or extinguishment of the hedged item (fair value hedge) or if it is probable that the hedged
cash flows will not occur (cash flow hedge).

Derivatives used to manage economic risk not designated as
hedges primarily represent economic risk management instruments of MSRs and mortgage banking operations, with gains or losses included
in mortgage banking income. In connection with its mortgage banking activities, BB&T enters into loan commitments to fund residential
mortgage loans at specified rates and for specified periods of time. To the extent that BB&T’s interest rate lock commitments
relate to loans



that will be held for sale upon funding, they are also accounted
for as derivatives, with gains or losses included in mortgage banking income. Gains and losses on other derivatives used to manage
economic risk are primarily associated with client derivative activity and included in other income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value
of net assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) in transactions accounted for as acquisitions. BB&T allocates goodwill
to the reporting unit(s) that receives significant benefits from the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized over an estimated useful
life, but rather is tested at least annually for impairment. BB&T performs its impairment testing in the fourth quarter of
each year and more frequently if circumstances exist that indicate a possible reduction in the fair value of the business below
its carrying value. BB&T measures impairment using the present value of estimated future cash flows. The analysis is based
upon available information regarding expected future cash flows and discount rates. Discount rates are based upon the cost of capital
specific to the industry in which the reporting unit operates. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
a second analysis is performed to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities. If, based on the second analysis, it is
determined that the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, BB&T would
recognize impairment for the excess of carrying value over fair value.

CDI and other intangible assets include premiums paid for
acquisitions of core deposits and other identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined
to have finite lives, are amortized based upon the estimated economic benefits received.

Loan Securitizations

BB&T enters into loan securitization transactions related
to most of its fixed-rate commercial and conforming residential mortgage loan originations. In connection with these transactions,
loans are converted into RMBS issued primarily by FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA, and are subsequently sold to third party investors. BB&T
records loan securitizations as a sale when the transferred loans are legally isolated from BB&T’s creditors and the
other accounting criteria for a sale are met. Gains or losses recorded on loan securitizations are based in part on the net carrying
amount of the loans sold, which is allocated between the loans sold and retained interests based on their relative fair values
at the date of sale. BB&T generally retains the mortgage servicing on loans sold. Since quoted market prices are not typically
available, BB&T estimates the fair value of these retained interests using modeling techniques to determine the net present
value of expected future cash flows. Such models incorporate management’s best estimates of key variables, such as prepayment
speeds and discount rates that would be used by market participants based on the risks involved.

MSRs

BB&T has two primary classes of MSRs for which it separately
manages the economic risks: residential and commercial. Residential MSRs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily
at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income. Commercial MSRs are recorded as other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of cost or market and are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated
period, that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future
net cash flows. The amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections.
BB&T periodically evaluates its commercial MSRs for impairment.

Equity-Based Compensation

BB&T maintains various equity-based compensation plans.
These plans provide for the granting of stock options (incentive and nonqualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
RSUs, performance units and performance shares to selected BB&T employees and directors. BB&T values share-based awards
at the grant date fair value and recognizes the expense over the requisite service period taking into account retirement eligibility.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

BB&T offers various pension plans and postretirement
benefit plans to employees. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial
valuation methods and assumptions. The discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by
reference to published high-quality bond indices, as well as certain hypothetical spot-rate yield curves. These yield curves were
constructed from the underlying bond price and yield data collected as of the plan’s measurement date and are represented
by a series of annualized, individual discount rates with durations ranging from six months to thirty years. BB&T also considers
the individual characteristics of the plan, such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations, when setting the discount
rate. The expected long-term rate of return on



assets is based on the expected returns for each major asset class in which the
plan invests, adjusted for the weight of each asset class in the target mix.

Insurance Income

Insurance commission revenue is recognized at the later of
the billing date or the effective date of the related insurance policies. Insurance premiums from underwriting activities are recognized
as income over the policy term. The portion of premiums that will be earned in the future is deferred and included in other liabilities
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New
Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted new guidance
impacting

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

. The new guidance requires: quantitative information about the significant
unobservable inputs used for Level 3 measurements; a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of recurring Level 3 measurements
to changes in the unobservable inputs disclosed, including the interrelationship between inputs; and a description of the company’s
valuation processes. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on BB&T’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. The new disclosures required by this guidance are included in Note 18 to these consolidated financial
statements.

Effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted new guidance
impacting

Comprehensive Income

that requires all changes in OCI to be presented either in a single continuous statement
of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. The guidance does not change the items that must
be reported in OCI. BB&T has elected to present two separate but consecutive financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted new guidance
impacting

Intangibles

that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the two step goodwill
impairment test is required. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on BB&T’s consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2013, the Company will adopt new guidance
impacting the presentation of certain items on the

Balance Sheet

. The new guidance requires an entity to disclose both gross
and net information about derivatives and securities borrowing and lending transactions that have a right of setoff or are subject
to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The adoption of this guidance will not impact BB&T’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but may result in certain additional disclosures.

Effective January 1, 2013, the Company will adopt new guidance
on

Business Combinations

. The new guidance clarifies that when a reporting entity recognizes an indemnification asset as
a result of a government-assisted acquisition of a financial institution and subsequently a change in the cash flows expected to
be collected on the indemnification asset occurs, the reporting entity should account for the change in the measurement of the
indemnification asset on the same basis as the change in the assets subject to indemnification. Any amortization of changes in
value should be limited to the lesser of the contractual term of the indemnification agreement or the remaining life of the indemnified
assets. BB&T has previously accounted for its indemnification asset in accordance with this guidance; accordingly, this guidance
will have no impact on BB&T’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2013, the Company will adopt new guidance
impacting

Comprehensive Income

that requires a reporting entity to present significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI
by the respective line items of net income. The adoption of this guidance will not impact BB&T’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows, but may result in certain additional disclosures.

agreements to repurchase, other borrowings, and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

BB&T had certain investments in marketable debt securities
and RMBS issued by FNMA and FHLMC that exceeded ten percent of shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2012. The FNMA investments
had total amortized cost and fair value of $13.1 billion and $13.3 billion, respectively. The FHLMC investments had total amortized
cost and fair value of $7.9 billion.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the debt securities
portfolio at December 31, 2012, by contractual maturity, are shown in the accompanying table. The expected life of RMBS will differ
from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay the underlying mortgage loans with or without prepayment
penalties. For purposes of the maturity table, RMBS, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity
groupings based on the contractual maturity.

BB&T conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate
each investment with an unrealized loss for OTTI. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security
is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded, net of tax,
in AOCI for available-for-sale securities.

Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary
include:

·

The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events
that may influence the operations of the issuer;

·

BB&T’s intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will
be required to sell these debt securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis;

·

The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost;

·

Whether the decline in fair value is attributable to specific conditions, such as conditions
in an industry or in a geographic area;

·

Whether a debt security has been downgraded by a rating agency;

·

Whether the financial condition of the issuer has deteriorated;

·

The seniority of the security;

·

Whether dividends have been reduced or eliminated, or scheduled interest payments on debt securities
have not been made; and

·

Any other relevant available information.

To the extent that BB&T has identified OTTI and does
not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that BB&T will not be required to sell the security prior to
recovery, the credit component of the unrealized loss is recognized in earnings and the non-credit component is recognized in AOCI.
In making this determination, BB&T considers its expected liquidity and capital needs, including its asset/liability management
needs, forecasts, strategies and other relevant information.

BB&T uses cash flow modeling to evaluate non-agency RMBS
in an unrealized loss position for potential credit impairment. These models give consideration to long-term macroeconomic factors
applied to current security default rates, prepayment rates and recovery rates and security-level performance. At December 31,
2012, four non-agency RMBS with an unrealized loss were below investment grade. None of the unrealized losses were significant.

At December 31, 2012, $79 million of unrealized loss on municipal
securities was the result of fair value hedge basis adjustments that are a component of amortized cost. Municipal securities in
an unrealized loss position are evaluated for credit impairment through a qualitative analysis of issuer performance and the primary
source of repayment. The evaluation of municipal securities indicated there were no credit losses evident.

Unearned income and net deferred loan fees and costs totaled
$298 million and $374 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

BB&T had $75.4 billion in loans secured by real estate
at December 31, 2012. However, these loans were not concentrated in any specific market or geographic area other than Branch Bank’s
primary markets. Certain loans have been pledged as collateral to the FHLB and to the FRB. The collateral pledged is used to secure
FHLB advances and letters of credit issued by the FHLB and to provide additional borrowing capacity.

Changes in the carrying amount and accretable yield for purchased impaired and nonimpaired covered loans

Commitments to lend additional funds to clients with loans
classified as TDRs were immaterial at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The gross additional interest income that would have been earned
if the loans and leases classified as nonaccrual had performed in accordance with the original terms was approximately $70 million,
$93 million and $131 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The gross additional interest income that would have been earned
in 2012, 2011 and 2010 had performing TDRs performed in accordance with the original terms is immaterial.

BB&T monitors the credit quality of its commercial portfolio
segment using internal risk ratings. These risk ratings are based on established regulatory guidance. Loans with a Pass rating

represent those not considered a problem credit. Special mention loans are those that have a potential
weakness deserving management’s close attention. Substandard loans are those for which a well-defined weakness has been identified
that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk.

Substandard loans are placed in nonaccrual status when BB&T
believes it is no longer probable it will collect all contractual cash flows. BB&T assigns an internal risk rating at loan
origination and reviews the relationship again on an annual basis or at any point management becomes aware of information affecting
the borrower’s ability to fulfill their obligations.



BB&T monitors the credit quality of its retail portfolio
segment based primarily on delinquency status, which is the primary factor considered in determining whether a retail loan should
be classified as nonaccrual.

The following tables illustrate the credit quality indicators associated with loans and leases held for investment.  Covered loans are excluded from this analysis because their related allowance is determined by loan pool performance.

Includes modifications made to existing TDRs, as well as new modifications that are considered TDRs.  Balances represent the recorded investment as of the end of the period in which the modification was made.

(2)

Includes TDRs made with a below market interest rate that also includes a modification of loan structure.

During 2012, a national bank regulatory agency issued guidance
that requires certain loans that had been discharged in bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be accounted for as TDRs
and possibly as nonperforming, regardless of their actual payment history and expected performance. As of December 31, 2012, the
Company’s primary regulators had not reached a final decision on how this guidance may apply to its regulated entities.
BB&T concluded that these loans should be classified as TDRs and these are included in “Other” in the above table.
BB&T has also concluded there is a reasonable expectation of collection of principal and interest and has classified these
loans as performing unless already classified as nonperforming.

Charge-offs recorded at the modification date were $25 million
and $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The forgiveness of principal or interest for TDRs
recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was immaterial.

The following table summarizes the pre-default balance for
modifications that experienced a payment default that had been classified as TDRs during the previous 12 months. BB&T defines
payment default as movement of the TDR to nonaccrual status, foreclosure or charge-off, whichever occurs first.

If a TDR subsequently defaults, BB&T evaluates the TDR for possible impairment.  As a result, the related allowance may be increased or charge-offs may be taken to reduce the carrying value of the loan.

During 2012, BB&T acquired the life and property and casualty
insurance divisions of Crump Group Inc. The changes in Insurance Services goodwill and other identifiable intangibles were primarily
the result of this acquisition, although the final purchase accounting has not been completed.

During 2012, BB&T completed the acquisition of Fort Lauderdale,
Florida-based BankAtlantic. BB&T acquired approximately $1.7 billion in loans and assumed approximately $3.5 billion in deposits.
BB&T also assumed the seller’s obligations with respect to outstanding trust preferred securities, with an aggregate
principal balance of $285 million. In exchange for the assumption of these liabilities, BB&T received a 95% preferred interest
in a newly established LLC, which holds a pool of loans and other net assets. BankAtlantic Bancorp also provided BB&T with
an incremental $35 million guarantee to further assure BB&T’s recovery of the $285 million. The LLC’s assets will
be monetized over time and once BB&T has recovered $285 million in preference amount from the LLC plus a defined return, BB&T’s
interest in the LLC will terminate. The net purchase price received, excluding cash held by BankAtlantic, was $45 million, which
consisted of net liabilities assumed less a deposit premium of $316 million. The changes in Community Banking goodwill and CDI
were primarily the result of this acquisition, although the final purchase accounting has not been completed.

At December 31, 2012, the weighted-average remaining life
of CDI and other identifiable intangibles was 7.9 years and 15.9 years, respectively. Estimated amortization expense of identifiable
intangible assets for each for the next five years total $105 million, $89 million, $75 million, $65 million and $56 million.

The unpaid principal balances of BB&T’s total residential
mortgage loans serviced for others consist primarily of agency conforming fixed-rate mortgage loans. Mortgage loans serviced for
others are not included in loans and leases on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, BB&T
sold residential mortgage loans from the held for sale portfolio and recognized pre-tax gains including marking LHFS to fair value
and the impact of interest rate lock commitments. These gains are recorded in noninterest income as a component of mortgage banking
income. BB&T retained the related MSRs and receives servicing fees.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, BB&T had residential mortgage
loans sold with recourse liability. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, BB&T has recourse exposure for these loans.
At both December 31, 2012 and 2011, BB&T has recorded reserves related to these recourse exposures. Payments made to date have
been immaterial.

BB&T also issues standard representations and warranties
related to mortgage loan sales to GSEs. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T does not believe that
any payments related to these warranties would materially change the financial condition or results of operations of BB&T.

Residential MSRs are primarily recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income in
the Consolidated Statements of Income for each period. BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the income
statement effect of changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions of its residential MSRs. The
following is an analysis of the activity in BB&T’s residential MSRs:

During 2012, the prepayment speed assumptions were updated
as actual prepayments have slowed relative to modeled projections as interest rates have begun to stabilize and the higher coupon,
faster prepaying mortgage loans were refinanced over the past two years. Management also increased its OAS assumption to reflect
the return that management believes a market participant would require in the current market. The servicing costs assumptions have
also been increased due to the expectation of higher costs that continued to impact the industry.

At December 31, 2012, the valuation of MSRs was based on
prepayment speeds ranging from 15.3% to 18.5% and OAS ranging from 8.22% to 8.35%. The sensitivity of the current fair value of
the residential MSRs to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in key economic assumptions is included in the accompanying table:

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should
not be considered to be predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear.
Also, in the above table, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated
without changing any other assumption; while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may magnify
or counteract the effect of the change.

rate commercial paper) that mature in 270 days or less. Other short-term borrowed funds include unsecured bank notes that mature
in less than one year, bank obligations with



a maturity of seven days that are collateralized by municipal securities and U.S.
Treasury tax and loan deposit notes payable to the U.S. Treasury upon demand.

years total $7.8 billion.

In connection with the acquisition of BankAtlantic, BB&T
assumed $285 million in junior subordinated debt to unconsolidated trusts, which was redeemed prior to December 31, 2012. BB&T
has no junior subordinated debt outstanding as of December 31, 2012.



NOTE 11. Shareholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

Dividends on the preferred stock, if declared, accrue and
are payable quarterly, in arrears. For each issuance, BB&T issued depositary shares, each of which represents a fractional
ownership interest in a share of the Company’s preferred stock. The preferred stock has no stated maturity and redemption
is solely at the option of the Company in whole, but not in part, upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event,
as defined. In addition, the preferred stock may be redeemed in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date after five years
from the date of issuance. Under current rules, any redemption of the preferred stock is subject to prior approval of the FRB.
The preferred stock is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligations of the Company.

Equity-Based Plans

At December 31, 2012, BB&T had options, restricted shares
and restricted share units outstanding from the following equity-based compensation plans: the 2012 Plan, the 2004 Plan, the Omnibus
Plan, the Directors’ Plan, and a plan assumed from an acquired entity. BB&T’s shareholders have approved all equity-based
compensation plans with the exception of the plan assumed from an acquired entity. As of December 31, 2012, the 2012 Plan is the
only plan that has shares available for future grants. The 2012 and 2004 Plans allow for accelerated vesting of awards for holders
who retire and have met all retirement eligibility requirements and in connection with certain other events.

BB&T’s 2012 and 2004 Plans are intended to assist
the Company in recruiting and retaining employees, directors and independent contractors and to associate the interests of eligible
participants with those of BB&T and its shareholders. At December 31, 2012, there were 30.6 million non-qualified and incentive
stock options at exercise prices ranging from $16.88 to $44.20, 13.9 million restricted shares and restricted share units outstanding
under the 2004 Plan and 110 thousand restricted share units outstanding under the 2012 Plan. Awards outstanding under the 2004
and 2012 Plans vest as follows: (1) those granted prior to 2010 generally vest over five years and (2) those granted after 2009
generally vest over four years. Options outstanding have a ten year term. At December 31, 2012, there were no shares available
for future grants under the 2004 Plan and 34.9 million shares available for future grants under the 2012 Plan.

At December 31, 2012, 14.7 million non-qualified and qualified
stock options at prices ranging from $32.66 to $43.25 were outstanding under the Omnibus Plan. All options under this plan are
fully vested and have a ten year term.

BB&T measures the fair value of each option award on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants
awarded in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Substantially all of BB&T’s option awards are granted in February of each
year:

BB&T determines the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes
option pricing model as follows: the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
the grant; the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of BB&T’s stock, adjusted to reflect the expected
dividend yield over the expected life of the option; the volatility factor is based on the historical volatility of BB&T’s
stock, adjusted to reflect the ways in which current information



indicates that the future is reasonably expected to differ
from the past; and the weighted-average expected life is based on the historical behavior of employees related to exercises, forfeitures
and cancellations.

BB&T measures the fair value of restricted shares based
on the price of BB&T’s common stock on the grant date and the fair value of restricted share units based on the price
of BB&T’s common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends that are foregone during the vesting
period.

compensation costs follows:

On a periodic basis, BB&T evaluates its income tax positions
based on tax laws and regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. This evaluation
takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities’ examinations of BB&T’s tax returns, recent positions
taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions, if any, and the overall tax environment in relation to tax-advantaged
transactions. The following table presents changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and

As of December 31, 2012, BB&T had $297 million of unrecognized
Federal and state tax benefits that would have impacted the effective tax rate if recognized. In addition, the Company had $37
million and $39 million in liabilities for tax-related interest recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012
and 2011, respectively. Total interest, net of the Federal benefit, related to unrecognized tax benefits recognized in the 2012,
2011 and 2010 Consolidated Statements of Income was immaterial. BB&T classifies interest and penalties related to income taxes
as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The IRS has completed its Federal income tax examinations
of BB&T through 2007.  Various years remain subject to examination by state taxing authorities.  In February 2010,
BB&T received an IRS statutory notice of deficiency for tax years 2002-2007 asserting a liability for taxes, penalties and
interest of approximately $892 million related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits and other deductions claimed by a subsidiary
in connection with a financing transaction.  BB&T paid the disputed tax, penalties and interest in March 2010 and filed
a lawsuit seeking a refund in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  The Court has scheduled the trial to begin March 4, 2013. 
BB&T recorded a receivable in other assets for the amount of this payment, less the reserve considered necessary in accordance
with applicable income tax accounting guidance.  On February 11, 2013, the U.S. Tax Court issued an adverse opinion in a case
between the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and the IRS involving a transaction with a structure similar to BB&T’s
financing transaction.  BB&T has confidence in its position because, among other reasons, BB&T will raise arguments
and issues in its case that were not considered by the Tax Court.  Bank of New York Mellon has indicated it intends to appeal
the decision.  Nonetheless, BB&T recognized a charge of approximately $281 million in the first quarter of 2013
as a result of its consideration of this adverse decision.  As litigation progresses, it is reasonably possible changes in
the reserve for uncertain tax positions could range from a decrease of $496 million to an increase of $328 million within the next
12 months.



NOTE 14. Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans

BB&T provides a defined benefit retirement plan qualified
under the Internal Revenue Code that covers most employees. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement and the employee's
compensation during the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment.

In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided
to certain key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the Internal
Revenue Code. Although technically unfunded plans, a Rabbi Trust and insurance policies on the lives of the certain covered employees
are available to finance future benefits.

The following are the significant actuarial assumptions that
were used to determine net periodic pension costs for the qualified pension plan:

Represents the rate to be achieved by 2015.

The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in
the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, BB&T considers long-term compound annualized
returns of historical market data for each asset category, as well as historical actual returns on the plan assets. Using this
reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average
expected long-term rate of return for the plan based on target asset allocations contained in BB&T's Investment Policy Statement.

Financial data relative to the defined benefit pension plans
is summarized in the following tables for the years indicated. The qualified pension plan prepaid asset is recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as a component of other assets and the nonqualified pension plans accrued liability is recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as a component of other liabilities. The data is calculated using an actuarial measurement date of December 31.

purposes. Management is not required to make a contribution to the qualified pension plan during 2013; however, management elected
to make a discretionary contribution of $270 million in the first quarter of 2013, and may make additional contributions in 2013
if determined appropriate. For the nonqualified plans, the employer contributions are based on benefit payments.

2018-2022



BB&T's primary total return objective is to achieve returns
that, over the long term, will fund retirement liabilities and provide for the desired plan benefits in a manner that satisfies
the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The plan assets have a long-term time horizon
that runs concurrent with the average life expectancy of the participants. As such, the Plan can assume a time horizon that extends
well beyond a full market cycle, and can assume an above-average level of risk, as measured by the standard deviation of annual
return. It is expected, however, that both professional investment management and sufficient portfolio diversification will smooth
volatility and help to generate a reasonable consistency of return. The investments are broadly diversified among economic sector,
industry, quality and size in order to reduce risk and to produce incremental return. Within approved guidelines and restrictions,
investment managers have wide discretion over the timing and selection of individual investments.

BB&T periodically reviews its asset allocation and investment
policy and makes changes to its target asset allocation. BB&T has established guidelines within each asset category to ensure
the appropriate balance of risk and reward. The current target asset allocations for the plan assets include a range of 40% to
52% for U.S. equity securities, 10% to 20% for international equity securities, 25% to 40% for fixed income securities, and 0%
to 12% for alternative investments, which include real estate, hedge funds, private equities and commodities, with any remainder
to be held in cash equivalents.

The fair value of BB&T's pension plan assets at December
31, 2012 and 2011, by asset category are reflected in the following tables. The three level fair value hierarchy that describes
the inputs used to measure these plan assets is defined in Note 18 "Fair Value Disclosures.”



The following table presents the activity for Level 3 plan assets, all of which are in alternative investments:

Defined Contribution Plans

BB&T offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other defined contribution
plans that permit employees to contribute from 1% to 50% of their cash compensation. For full-time employees who are 21 years of
age or older with one year or more of service, BB&T makes matching contributions of up to 6% of the employee's compensation.
BB&T's contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan and nonqualified defined contribution plans totaled $97 million, $85 million
and $83 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. BB&T also offers defined contribution plans
to certain employees of subsidiaries who do not participate in the 401(k) Savings Plan.

Other benefits

There are various other employment contracts, deferred compensation
arrangements and covenants not to compete with selected members of management and certain retirees. In addition, BB&T sponsors
a plan which provides certain retirees with a subsidy for purchasing health care and life insurance. In 2004, BB&T amended
this plan to eliminate the subsidy for those employees retiring after December 31, 2004. BB&T also reduced the subsidy paid
to employees who retired on or before December 31, 2004, were age 55 years or older, and had at least ten years of service. For
those employees, the subsidy is based upon years of service of the employee at the time of retirement. These plans and their obligations
are not material to BB&T’s financial statements.

NOTE 15. Commitments and Contingencies

BB&T utilizes a variety of financial instruments to meet
the financing needs of clients and to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments
to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees and derivatives. BB&T also has commitments to fund certain affordable
housing investments and contingent liabilities related to certain sold loans.

Commitments to extend, originate or purchase credit are primarily
lines of credit to businesses and consumers and have specified rates and maturity dates. Many of these commitments also have adverse
change clauses, which allow BB&T to cancel the commitment due to deterioration in the borrowers’ creditworthiness.

The following table presents a summary of certain commitments and contingencies:

Amount of future funding commitments included in investments related to affordable

housing and historic rehabilitation projects



Lending exposure to these affordable housing projects



Tax credits subject to recapture related to affordable housing projects



Investments in private equity and similar investments



Future funding commitments to private equity and similar investments



Letters of credit and financial guarantees written are unconditional
commitments issued by BB&T to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued
to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuance, bond financing and similar transactions,
the majority of which are to tax



exempt entities. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees is essentially the
same as that involved in extending loans to clients and as such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary.

BB&T invests in certain affordable housing and historic
building rehabilitation projects throughout its market area as a means of supporting local communities, and receives tax credits
related to these investments. BB&T typically acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over
the operating or financial policies of the partnerships. Branch Bank typically provides financing during the construction and development
of the properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project.
Tax credits are subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level.
BB&T’s maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding
balance, future funding commitments and any related loans to the entity. Loans to these entities are underwritten in substantially
the same manner as are other loans and are generally secured.

BB&T has investments in and future funding commitments
to certain private equity and similar investments. BB&T’s risk exposure relating to such commitments is generally limited
to the amount of investments and future funding commitments made.

A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash
flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or interest rate. For additional disclosures related
to BB&T’s derivatives refer to Note 19 “Derivative Financial Instruments.”

BB&T has sold certain mortgage-related loans that contain
recourse provisions. These provisions generally require BB&T to reimburse the investor for a share of any loss that is incurred
after the disposal of the property. BB&T also issues standard representations and warranties related to mortgage loan sales
to GSEs. Refer to Note 7 “Loan Servicing” for additional disclosures related to these exposures.

In the ordinary course of business, BB&T indemnifies
its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from pending litigation. BB&T
also issues standard representations and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales,
brokerage activities and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnification arrangements provide similar
indemnifications to BB&T. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T does not believe that any payments
related to these guarantees would materially change the financial position or results of operations of BB&T.

Legal Proceedings

The nature of the business of BB&T’s banking and
other subsidiaries ordinarily results in a certain amount of claims, litigation, investigations and legal and administrative cases
and proceedings, all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. BB&T believes it has meritorious
defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and, with respect to such legal proceedings,
intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according to management’s judgment as to what
is in the best interests of BB&T and its shareholders.

The Company was a defendant in three separate cases primarily
challenging the Company’s daily ordering of debit transactions posted to customer checking accounts for the period from 2003
to 2010. The plaintiffs requested class action treatment; however, no class was certified. The court initially denied motions by
the Company to dismiss these cases and compel them to be submitted to individual arbitration. The Company then filed appeals in
all three matters. There were numerous subsequent procedural developments. These included an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in
one matter which resulted in a November 2011 decision that benefited the Company and two decisions in July 2012 in two other matters
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ordering arbitration. Those latter two matters are now concluded. The first
remains pending and therefore, the issues raised by the motions and appeal in this one matter have not been finally decided. If
the motions or any appeals are ultimately granted, they would preclude class action treatment. Even if such an appeal is denied,
the Company believes it has meritorious defenses against this matter, including class certification. In addition, no damages have
been specified by the plaintiffs. Because of these circumstances, no specific loss or range of loss can currently be determined.

On at least a quarterly basis, BB&T assesses its liabilities
and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. For those matters
where it is probable that BB&T will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, BB&T records a
liability in its consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant
developments on at least a quarterly basis. For other matters, where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable,
BB&T has not accrued legal reserves. While the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently
available, advice of counsel and



available insurance coverage, BB&T’s management
believes that its established legal reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from BB&T’s legal proceedings
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated
cash flows of BB&T. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of
these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to BB&T’s consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations
or consolidated cash flows.

NOTE 16. Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions

Branch Bank and BB&T FSB are required by the FRB to maintain
reserve balances in the form of vault cash or deposits with the FRB based on specified percentages of certain deposit types, subject
to various adjustments. At December 31, 2012, the net reserve requirement amounted to $266 million.

Branch Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit
the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, both BB&T and Branch Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating
to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain “well-capitalized”
under the prompt corrective action regulations. BB&T does not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially
affect the ability of Branch Bank to pay dividends.

BB&T is subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory—and
possibly additional discretionary—actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on BB&T’s
financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company
must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of BB&T’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet
items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. BB&T’s capital amounts and classification also are subject to qualitative
judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. BB&T is in full compliance with these requirements.
Banking regulations also identify five capital categories for insured depository institutions: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized,
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, BB&T and Branch
Bank were classified as “well-capitalized.”

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure
capital adequacy require BB&T to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations)
to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio).

Risk-based capital ratios, which include Tier 1
Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Common Equity, are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of
capital and risk-weighted assets. BB&T reevaluated its process related to calculating risk-weighted assets and determined
that certain adjustments, primarily related to the presentation of certain unfunded lending commitments, were required in
order to conform to regulatory guidance.  These adjustments resulted in an increase to risk-weighted assets and a decrease in
BB&T’s risk-based capital ratios.

The Company has revised its calculation of risk-weighted assets and adjusted the applicable ratios.

As an approved seller/servicer, Branch Bank is required
to maintain minimum levels of shareholders’ equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United States Department
of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, FHLMC and FNMA. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, Branch Bank’s equity was above all
required levels.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, BB&T had segregated cash
deposits totaling $36 million and $20 million, respectively. These deposits relate to monies held for the exclusive benefit of
clients, primarily at BB&T’s broker/dealer subsidiaries.

NOTE 18. Fair Value Disclosures

BB&T carries various assets and liabilities at fair value
based on applicable accounting standards, including prime residential mortgage and commercial mortgage loans originated as LHFS.
Accounting standards define fair value as the exchange price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or
the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction
between market participants. These standards also established a three level fair value hierarchy that describes the inputs that
are used to measure assets and liabilities. Level 1 asset and liability fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 asset and liability fair values are based on observable inputs that include: quoted
market prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted market prices that are not in an active market; or other inputs that are
observable in the market and can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 assets and liabilities are financial instruments whose value is calculated by the use of pricing models and/or discounted
cash flow methodologies, as well as financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management
judgment or estimation. These methodologies may result in a significant portion of the fair value being derived from unobservable
data.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis are summarized below:

Based on an analysis of the nature and risks of these investments, BB&T has determined that presenting these investments as a single class is appropriate.

(3)

Short-term borrowed funds reflect securities sold short positions.

The following discussion focuses on the valuation techniques
and significant inputs used by BB&T in determining the Level 2 and Level 3 fair values of each significant class of assets
and liabilities.

BB&T generally utilizes a third-party pricing service
in determining the fair value of its securities portfolio. Fair value measurements are derived from market-based pricing matrices
that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids,
issuer spreads and broker quotes. As described by security type below, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be
applicable. In the event that market observable data was not available, which would generally occur due to the lack of an active
market for a given security, the valuation of the security would be subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management.

Specific valuation techniques and inputs used in determining
the fair value of each significant class of assets and liabilities follows:

Trading securities:

Trading securities are composed
of all types of debt and equity securities, but the majority consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, GSEs, or
states and political subdivisions. The valuation techniques used for these investments are more fully discussed below.

GSE securities and RMBS issued by GSE:

These are debt
securities issued by GSEs. GSE pass-through securities are valued using market-based pricing matrices that are based on observable
inputs including benchmark TBA security pricing and yield curves that were estimated based on U.S. Treasury yields and certain
floating rate indices. The pricing matrices for these securities may also give consideration to pool-specific data supplied directly
by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using market-based pricing matrices that are based on observable inputs including offers, bids,
reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment
speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above.

States and political subdivisions:

These securities
are valued using market-based pricing matrices that are based on observable inputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer spreads,
material event notices and benchmark yield curves.



Non-agency RMBS:

Pricing matrices for these securities
are based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics
of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above.

Other securities:

These securities consist primarily
of mutual funds and corporate bonds. These securities are valued based on a review of quoted market prices for assets as well as
through the various other inputs discussed previously.

Covered securities:

Covered securities are covered
by FDIC loss sharing agreements and consist of re-remic non-agency RMBS, municipal securities and non-agency RMBS. Covered state
and political subdivision securities and certain non-agency RMBS are valued in a manner similar to the approach described above
for these asset classes. The re-remic non-agency RMBS, which are categorized as Level 3, were valued based on broker dealer quotes
that reflected certain unobservable market inputs. Sensitivity to changes in the fair value of covered securities is significantly
offset by changes in BB&T’s indemnification asset from the FDIC. Subject to certain restrictions, the terms of the loss
sharing agreement associated with these re-remic non-agency RMBS provide that Branch Bank will be reimbursed by the FDIC for 95%
of any and all losses.

LHFS:

BB&T originates certain mortgage loans to
be sold to investors. These loans are carried at fair value based on BB&T’s election of the Fair Value Option. The fair
value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. The changes in fair value of
these assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing
associated with the mortgage loan held for sale.

Residential MSRs:

BB&T estimates the fair value
of residential MSRs using an OAS valuation model to project MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then
discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The OAS model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment
assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. Fair value
estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available,
other observable market data.

Derivative assets and liabilities:

BB&T uses derivatives
to manage various financial risks. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices,
dealer quotes and internal pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. The fair values of interest rate
lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as Level 3, are based on quoted market prices
adjusted for commitments that BB&T does not expect to fund and include the value attributable to the net servicing fees.

Private equity and similar investments:

BB&T has
private equity and similar investments that are measured at fair value based on the investment’s net asset value. In many
cases there are no observable market values for these investments and therefore management must estimate the fair value based on
a comparison of the operating performance of the company to multiples in the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires
significant judgment and actual values in a sale could differ materially from those estimated.

Short-term borrowed funds:

Short-term borrowed funds
represent debt securities sold short. These are entered into through BB&T’s brokerage subsidiary. These trades are executed
as a hedging strategy for the purposes of supporting institutional and retail client trading activities.

BB&T’s policy is to recognize transfers in and
transfers out of Levels 1, 2 and 3 as of the end of a reporting period. During the year ended December 31, 2012, BB&T did not
have any material transfer of securities between levels in the fair value hierarchy. During the year ended December 31, 2011, BB&T
transferred certain state and political subdivision securities out of Level 3 as a result of management’s decision to reclassify
them from available for sale to held to maturity classification, which is not recorded at fair value. During the year ended December
31, 2010, transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 were the result of increased observable market activity for these securities. There
were no gains or losses recognized as a result of the transfers of securities during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or
2010. There were no significant transfers of securities between Level 1 and Level 2 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011
or 2010.

The majority of BB&T’s private equity and similar
investments are in SBIC qualified funds. The significant investment strategies for these funds primarily focus on equity and subordinated
debt investments in privately-held middle market companies. The majority of these investments are not redeemable and distributions
are received as the underlying assets of the funds liquidate. The timing of distributions, which are expected to occur on various
dates through 2025, is uncertain and dependent on various events such as recapitalizations, refinance transactions and ownership
changes among others. Excluding the investment of future funds, BB&T estimates these investments have a weighted average remaining
life of approximately three years; however, the timing and amount of distributions may vary significantly. As of December 31, 2012,
restrictions on the ability to sell the investments include, but are not limited to, consent of a majority member or general partner
approval for transfer of ownership. BB&T’s investments are spread over numerous privately-held middle market companies,
and thus the sensitivity to a change in fair value for any single investment is limited. The significant unobservable inputs for
these investments are EBITDA multiples that ranged from 5x to 11x, with a weighted average of 7x, at December 31, 2012.

The change in fair value is reflected in mortgage banking income.  Excluding government guaranteed loans, there were no nonaccrual loans or loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest.



Additionally, accounting standards require the disclosure
of the estimated fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value. A financial instrument is defined as
cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity or a contract that creates a contractual obligation or right to deliver or
receive cash or another financial instrument from a second entity. For the financial instruments that BB&T does not record
at fair value, estimates of fair value are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data and information about the financial
instrument. Fair values are calculated based on the value of one trading unit without regard to any premium or discount that may
result from concentrations of ownership of a financial instrument, possible tax ramifications, estimated transaction costs that
may result from bulk sales or the relationship between various financial instruments. No readily available market exists for a
significant portion of BB&T’s financial instruments. Fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current
economic conditions, currency and interest rate risk characteristics, loss experience and other factors. Many of these estimates
involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, the calculated fair
value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable
in a current sale of the instrument. In addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates.
The following methods and assumptions were used by BB&T in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents and segregated cash due from
banks

: For these short-term instruments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair values.

Securities held to maturity:

The fair values of securities
held to maturity are based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields and securities, TBA prices, reported
trades, issuer spreads, current bids and offers, monthly payment information and collateral performance.

Loans receivable

: The fair values for loans are estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, applying interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms and credit quality,
which are deemed to be indicative of orderly transactions in the current market. For commercial loans and leases, discount rates
may be adjusted to address additional credit risk on lower risk grade instruments. For residential mortgage and other consumer
loans, internal prepayment risk models are used to adjust contractual cash flows. Loans are aggregated into pools of similar terms
and credit quality and discounted using a LIBOR based rate. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair values.

FDIC loss share receivable

: The fair value of the
FDIC loss share receivable was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, applying a risk free interest rate that is adjusted
for the uncertainty in the timing and amount of these cash flows. The expected cash flows to/from the FDIC related to loans were
estimated using the same assumptions that were used in determining the accounting values for the related loans. The expected cash
flows to/from the FDIC related to securities are based upon the fair value of the related securities and the payment that would
be required if the securities were sold for that amount. The FDIC loss share agreements are not transferrable and, accordingly,
there is no market for this receivable.

Deposit liabilities

: The fair values for demand deposits,
interest-checking accounts, savings accounts and certain money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable
on demand. Fair values for CDs are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current interest rates to aggregate
expected maturities. In addition, nonfinancial instruments such as core deposit intangibles are not recorded at fair value. BB&T
has developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base and, in the opinion of management, these items
add significant value to BB&T.



Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase
agreements and short-term borrowed funds

: The carrying amounts of Federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements
and short-term borrowed funds approximate their fair values.

Long-term debt

: The fair values of long-term debt
are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by
using discounted cash flow analyses, based on BB&T’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.

Contractual commitments

: The fair values of commitments
are estimated using the fees charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements
and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair values also consider the difference
between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of guarantees and letters of credit are estimated
based on the counterparties’ creditworthiness and average default rates for loan products with similar risks. These respective
fair value measurements would be categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

BB&T uses a variety of derivative instruments to manage
interest rate and foreign exchange risks. These instruments consist of interest-rate swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, collars, financial
forward and futures contracts, when-issued securities, foreign exchange contracts and options written and purchased. A derivative
is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index
or referenced interest rate. There are four areas of risk management addressed through the use of derivatives: balance sheet management,
mortgage banking operations, MSRs and client-related and other risk management activities. No portion of the change in fair value
of the derivative has been excluded from effectiveness testing. The ineffective portion was immaterial for all periods presented.

Cash Flow Hedges

BB&T’s floating rate business loans, overnight
funding, FHLB advances, medium-term bank notes and long-term debt expose it to variability in cash flows for interest payments.
The risk management objective for these floating rate assets and liabilities is to hedge the variability in the interest payments
and receipts on future cash flows for forecasted transactions. All of BB&T’s current cash flow hedges are hedging exposure
to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on then existing financial
instruments.

For a qualifying cash flow hedge, the portion of changes
in the fair value of the derivatives that has been highly effective is recognized in OCI until the related cash flows from the
hedged item are recognized in earnings. If a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective,
the gain or loss in OCI is amortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring during the forecast period or within a short period thereafter, hedge
accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in OCI is reported in earnings immediately. At December 31, 2012, BB&T had
$173 million of unrecognized after-tax losses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in OCI, compared to $159 million
of unrecognized after-tax losses at December 31, 2011.

The estimated amount to be reclassified from OCI into earnings
during the next 12 months is a loss totaling approximately $59 million. This includes active hedges and gains and losses related
to hedges that were terminated early for which the forecasted transactions are still probable. The proceeds from these terminations
were included in cash flows from financing activities.



Fair Value Hedges

BB&T’s fixed rate long-term debt, CDs, FHLB advances,
loans and state and political subdivision securities produce exposure to losses in value as interest rates change. The risk management
objective for hedging fixed rate assets and liabilities is to convert the fixed rate paid or received to a floating rate. BB&T
accomplishes its risk management objective by hedging exposure to changes in fair value of fixed rate financial instruments primarily
through the use of swaps. For a qualifying fair value hedge, changes in the value of the derivatives that have been highly effective
as hedges are recognized in current period earnings along with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the designated hedged
item attributable to the risk being hedged.

During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, BB&T
terminated certain fair value hedges related to its long-term debt and municipal securities and received net proceeds of $85 million
and $185 million, respectively. When a hedge has been terminated but the hedged item remains outstanding, the proceeds from the
termination of these hedges have been reflected as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt/other financial instrument
and are being amortized to earnings over its estimated remaining life. The proceeds from these terminations were included in cash
flows from financing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, BB&T recognized pre-tax benefits of $256
million and $205 million, respectively, through reductions of interest expense from previously unwound fair value debt hedges.

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedges

Derivatives not designated as hedges are those that are entered
into as either balance sheet risk management instruments or to facilitate client needs. Balance sheet risk management hedges are
those hedges that do not qualify to be treated as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge or a foreign currency hedge for accounting
purposes, but are necessary to economically manage the risk associated with an asset or liability.

This category of hedges includes derivatives that hedge mortgage
banking operations and MSRs. For mortgage loans originated for sale, BB&T is exposed to changes in market rates and conditions
subsequent to the interest rate lock and funding date. BB&T’s risk management strategy related to its interest rate lock
commitment derivatives and LHFS includes using mortgage-based derivatives such as forward commitments and options in order to mitigate
market risk. For MSRs, BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in the fair
value of its MSRs. For the year ended December 31, 2012, BB&T recorded a gain of $128 million related to these derivatives,
which was offset by a negative $32 million valuation adjustment related to the MSR. For the year ended December 31, 2011, BB&T
recorded a gain of $394 million related to these derivatives, which was offset by a negative $341 million valuation adjustment
related to the MSR.

BB&T also held, as risk management instruments, other
derivatives not designated as hedges primarily to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients, as well as activities related
to balance sheet management.

Derivatives Credit Risk – Dealer Counterparties

Credit risk related to derivatives arises when amounts receivable
from a counterparty exceed those payable to the same counterparty. BB&T addresses the risk of loss by subjecting dealer counterparties
to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans or other extensions of credit and by requiring collateral.
Dealer counterparties operate under agreements to provide cash and/or liquid collateral when unsecured loss positions exceed negotiated
limits.

As of December 31, 2012, BB&T had received cash collateral
from dealer counterparties totaling $44 million related to derivatives in a gain position of $40 million and had posted $639 million
in cash collateral to dealer counterparties to secure derivatives in a loss position of $650 million. In the event that BB&T’s
credit ratings had been downgraded below investment grade, the amount of collateral posted to these counterparties would have increased
by $12 million. As of December 31, 2011, BB&T had received cash collateral from dealer counterparties totaling $82 million
related to derivatives in a gain position of $79 million and had posted $639 million in cash collateral to dealer counterparties
to secure derivatives in a loss position of $669 million. In the event that BB&T’s credit ratings had been downgraded
below investment grade, the amount of collateral posted to these counterparties would have increased by $30 million.

After collateral postings are considered, BB&T had no
unsecured positions in a gain with dealer counterparties at December 31, 2012, compared to $3 million at December 31, 2011. All
of BB&T’s derivative contracts with dealer counterparties settle on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis, with daily
movement of collateral between counterparties required within established netting agreements. BB&T only transacts with dealer
counterparties that are national market makers with strong credit ratings.



Derivatives Credit Risk – Central Clearing Parties

BB&T also clears certain derivatives through central
clearing parties that require initial margin collateral, as well as additional collateral for trades in a net loss position. Initial
margin collateral requirements are established by central clearing parties on varying bases, with such amounts generally designed
to offset the risk of non-payment. Initial margin is generally calculated by applying the maximum loss experienced in value over
a specified time horizon to the portfolio of existing trades. As of December 31, 2012, BB&T had posted $111 million in cash
collateral, including initial margin, related to the clearing of derivatives in an $11 million net loss position. As of December
31, 2011, BB&T had posted $145 million in cash collateral, including initial margin, related to the clearing of derivatives
in a $60 million net loss position. BB&T had no significant unsecured positions in a gain with central clearing parties at
December 31, 2012.

NOTE 21. Operating Segments

BB&T's operations are divided into six reportable business
segments: Community Banking, Residential Mortgage Banking, Dealer Financial Services, Specialized Lending, Insurance Services,
and Financial Services. These business segments have been identified based on BB&T’s organizational structure. The segments
require unique technology and marketing strategies and offer different products and services through a number of distinct branded
LOBs. While BB&T is managed as an integrated organization, individual executive managers are held accountable for the operations
of these business segments.

BB&T emphasizes revenue growth by focusing on client
service, sales effectiveness and relationship management along with an organizational focus on referring clients between LOBs.
The business objective is to provide BB&T’s entire suite of products to our clients with the end goal of providing our
clients the best financial experience in the marketplace. The segment results contained herein are presented based on internal
management accounting policies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, there is
no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP. The performance of the segments is
not comparable with BB&T’s consolidated results or with similar information presented by any other financial institution.
Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the
segments would perform if they operated as independent entities.

The management accounting process uses various estimates
and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the operating segments. To determine financial performance for each
segment, BB&T allocates capital, funding charges and credits, an allocated provision for loan and lease losses, certain noninterest
expenses and income tax provisions to each segment, as applicable. To promote revenue growth, certain revenues of Residential Mortgage
Banking, Specialized Lending, Insurance Services, Financial Services and other segments are reflected in noninterest income in
the individual segment results and also allocated to Community Banking and Financial Services. These allocated revenues are reflected
in intersegment net referral fees and eliminated in Other, Treasury & Corporate. Additionally certain client groups of
the Community Bank have also been identified as clients of other LOBs within the business segments. These client groups include
the commercial clients being serviced within the Commercial Finance LOB that is part of the Specialized Lending segment and the
identified wealth and private banking clients of the Wealth Division within the Financial Services segment. The net interest income
and associated net FTP associated with these customers’ loans and deposits is accounted for in the Community Bank in the
respective line categories of net interest income (expense) and net intersegment interest income (expense). For the Commercial
Finance LOB and the Wealth Division, their NIM and net intersegment interest income has been combined in the net intersegment interest
income (expense) line with an appropriate offsetting amount to the Other, Treasury, and Corporate line item to ensure consolidated
totals reflect the Company’s total NIM for loans and deposits. Allocation methodologies are subject to periodic adjustment
as the internal management accounting system is revised and business or product lines within the segments change. Also, because
the development and application of these methodologies is a dynamic process, the financial results presented may be periodically
revised.

BB&T utilizes an FTP system to eliminate the effect
of interest rate risk from the segments’ net interest income because such risk is centrally managed within the Treasury function.
The FTP system credits or charges the segments with the economic value or cost of the funds the segments create or use. The FTP
system provides a funds credit for sources of funds and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. The net FTP credit
or charge, which includes intercompany interest income and expense, is reflected as net intersegment income (expense) in the accompanying
tables.

The allocated provision for loan and lease losses is also
allocated to the relevant segments based on management’s assessment of the segments’ credit risks. During the first
quarter of 2011, management refined the process related to assigning the allocated provision between the Company’s operating
segments. Unlike the provision for loan and lease losses recorded pursuant to GAAP, the allocated provision is designed to achieve
a higher degree of correlation between the loan loss experience and the GAAP basis provision at the segment level, while at the
same time providing management with a measure of operating performance that gives appropriate consideration to the risks inherent
in each of the Company’s operating segments. Any over or under allocated provision for loan and lease losses is reflected
in Other, Treasury & Corporate to arrive at consolidated results.

BB&T allocates expenses to the reportable segments based
on various methodologies, including volume and amount of loans and deposits and the number of full-time equivalent employees. Allocation
systems are refined from time to time along with further identification of certain cost pools. These cost pools and refinements
are implemented to provide for improved managerial reporting of cost to the appropriate business segments. A portion of corporate
overhead expense is not allocated, but is retained in corporate accounts and reflected as Other, Treasury & Corporate
in the accompanying tables. The majority of depreciation expense is recorded in support units and allocated to the segments as
part of allocated corporate expense. Income taxes are allocated to the various segments based on taxable income and statutory rates
applicable to the segment.



Community Banking

Community Banking serves individual and business clients
by offering a variety of loan and deposit products and other financial services. Community Banking is primarily responsible for
serving client relationships and, therefore, is credited with certain revenue from the Residential Mortgage Banking, Financial
Services, Insurance Services, Specialized Lending, and other segments, which is reflected in net referral fees.

Residential Mortgage Banking

Residential Mortgage Banking retains and services mortgage
loans originated by Community Banking as well as those purchased from various correspondent originators. Mortgage loan products
include fixed and adjustable rate government and conventional loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing
residential properties. Substantially all of the properties are owner occupied. BB&T generally retains the servicing rights
to loans sold. Residential Mortgage Banking earns interest on loans held in the warehouse and portfolio, earns fee income from
the origination and servicing of mortgage loans and recognizes gains or losses from the sale of mortgage loans.

Dealer Financial Services

Dealer Financial Services originates loans to consumers on
a prime and nonprime basis for the purchase of automobiles. Such loans are originated on an indirect basis through approved franchised
and independent automobile dealers throughout the BB&T market area and nationally through Regional Acceptance Corporation.
This segment also originates loans for the purchase of boats and recreational vehicles originated through dealers in BB&T’s
market area. In addition, financing and servicing to dealers for their inventories is provided through a joint relationship between
Dealer Financial Services and Community Banking.

Specialized Lending

BB&T's Specialized Lending consists of eight LOBs that
provide specialty finance products to consumers and businesses. These LOBs are a combination of LOBs and operating subsidiaries
of either the Company or Branch Bank. The LOBs include Commercial Finance, which contains commercial finance and mortgage warehouse
lending, and Governmental Finance, which is responsible for tax-exempt government finance. Operating subsidiaries include BB&T
Equipment Finance, which provides equipment leasing largely within BB&T’s banking footprint; Sheffield Financial, a division
of BB&T FSB (merged into Branch Bank on January 1, 2013), a dealer-based financer of equipment for both small businesses and
consumers; Lendmark Financial Services, a direct consumer finance lending company; Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation, which
includes AFCO and CAFO, insurance premium finance LOBs that provide funding to businesses in the United States and Canada and to
consumers in certain markets within BB&T’s banking footprint; and Grandbridge, a full-service commercial mortgage banking
lender providing loans on a national basis. Branch Bank clients as well as nonbank clients within and outside BB&T’s
primary geographic market area are served by these eight LOBs. The Community Banking segment receives credit for referrals to these
LOBs with the corresponding charge retained as part of Other, Treasury & Corporate in the accompanying tables.

Insurance Services

BB&T's insurance agency / brokerage network is the eighth
largest in the world. Insurance Services provides property and casualty, life and health insurance to businesses and individuals.
It also provides small business and corporate services, such as workers compensation and professional liability, as well as surety
coverage and title insurance. In addition, Insurance Services underwrites a limited amount of property and casualty coverage. Community
Banking and Financial Services receive credit for insurance commissions on referred accounts, with the corresponding charge retained
in the corporate office, which is reflected as part of Other, Treasury & Corporate in the accompanying tables.

Financial Services

Financial Services provides personal trust administration,
estate planning, investment counseling, wealth management, asset management, employee benefits services, corporate banking and
corporate trust services to individuals, corporations, institutions, foundations and government entities. Financial Services also
offers clients investment alternatives, including discount brokerage services, equities, fixed-rate and variable-rate annuities,
mutual funds and governmental and municipal bonds through BB&T Investment Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Branch Bank.

Financial Services includes a full-service brokerage and
investment banking firm that provides services in retail brokerage, equity and debt underwriting, investment advice, corporate
finance and equity research and facilitates the origination, trading and distribution of fixed-income securities and equity products
in both the public and private capital markets. Financial



Services also has a public finance department that provides
investment banking services, financial advisory services and municipal bond financing to a variety of regional taxable and tax-exempt
issuers.

Financial Services includes a group of BB&T-sponsored
private equity and mezzanine investment funds that invests in privately owned middle-market operating companies to facilitate growth
or ownership transition while leveraging the Community Banking network for referrals and other bank services. Financial Services
also includes the Corporate Banking Division that originates and services large corporate relationships, syndicated lending relationships
and client derivatives. Community Banking receives an interoffice credit for referral fees, with the corresponding charge reflected
as part of Other, Treasury & Corporate in the accompanying tables. Also captured within the net intersegment interest
income for Financial Services is the NIM for the loans and deposits assigned to the Wealth Management Division that are housed
in the Community Bank.

Other, Treasury & Corporate

Other, Treasury & Corporate is the combination of
the Other segment that represents operating entities that do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for disclosure;
BB&T’s Treasury function, which is responsible for the management of the securities portfolios, overall balance sheet
funding and liquidity, and overall management of interest rate risk; the corporate support functions that have not been allocated
to the business segments; merger-related charges or credits that are incurred as part of acquisition and conversion of acquired
entities; nonrecurring charges that are considered to be unusual in nature or infrequent and not reflective of the normal operations
of the segments; and intercompany eliminations including intersegment net referral fees and net intersegment interest income (expense).

The substantial majority of the loan portfolio acquired in
the Colonial acquisition is covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC and is managed outside of the Community Banking segment.
The assets and related interest income from this loan portfolio have an expected finite business life and are therefore included
in the Other, Treasury & Corporate segment. Results for BankAtlantic were included in the Other, Treasury & Corporate
segment until the system conversion in October 2012. Historically, performance results of bank acquisitions prior to system conversion
are reported in this segment and on a post-conversion date are reported in the Community Banking segment.
