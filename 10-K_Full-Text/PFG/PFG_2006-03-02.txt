NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains
statements which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to trends in operations and financial
results and the business and the products of the Registrant and its subsidiaries, as well as other statements including words such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend"
and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on the Company.
Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

Actual
results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to the following:
(1) a decline or increased volatility in the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rates of investment, either of which could reduce our
net income, revenues and assets under management; (2) our investment portfolio is subject to several risks which may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our sales,
profitability and the investment returns credited to our customers; (3) competition from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and
stronger financial performance may impair our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability; (4) a downgrade in any of our ratings may increase
policy surrenders and withdrawals, reduce new sales and terminate relationships with distributors and cause some of our existing liabilities to be subject to acceleration, additional collateral
support, changes in terms, or creation of additional financial obligations; (5) our efforts to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our profitability and surplus may not be effective;
(6) if we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives and develop new distribution sources, sales of our products and services may be reduced; (7) our international businesses
face political, legal, operational and other risks that could reduce our profitability in those businesses; (8) our reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove
inadequate, requiring us to increase liabilities; (9) our ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet our obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws
impose on Principal Life Insurance Company ("Principal Life"); (10) the pattern of amortizing our deferred policy acquisition costs ("DPAC") on our Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
("SFAS") No. 97

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of
Investments ("

SFAS 97") products may change, impacting both the level of the asset and the timing of our operating earnings; (11) we may need to fund deficiencies in our
closed block ("Closed Block") assets; (12) changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards may reduce our profitability; (13) litigation and regulatory investigations may affect our
financial strength or reduce our profitability; (14) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our profitability; and (15) applicable laws and our stockholder rights
plan, certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests.


PART I

Item 1.    Business

The Principal Financial Group is a leading provider of retirement savings, investment and insurance products and services with $195.2 billion in assets
under management and approximately fifteen million customers worldwide as of December 31, 2005.

Our
U.S. and international operations concentrate primarily on asset accumulation and management. In addition, we offer a broad range of individual and group life insurance, group health
insurance, and individual and group disability insurance.

We
primarily focus on small and medium sized businesses, which we define as companies with less than 1,000 employees, providing a broad array of retirement and employee benefit solutions
to meet the needs of the business, the business owner and their employees. With over 31,000 plans, we are the leading provider of corporate defined contribution plans in the U.S., according to
Spectrem Group. We are also the leading employee stock ownership plan consultant. In addition, we are a leading provider of nonqualified plans, defined benefit plans and plan termination annuities. We
are also one of the largest providers of non-medical insurance product solutions.

We
believe small and medium sized businesses are an underserved market, offering attractive growth opportunities in the U.S. in retirement services and other employee benefits. We also
believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage our U.S. retirement expertise into select international markets that have adopted or are moving toward private sector defined contribution
pension systems. This opportunity is particularly compelling as aging populations around the world are driving increased demand for retirement accumulation, retirement asset management, and retirement
income management solutions.

Our Operating Segments

We organize our businesses into the following operating segments:

•

U.S.
Asset Management and Accumulation;

•

International
Asset Management and Accumulation; and

•

Life
and Health Insurance.

We
also have a Corporate and Other segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment.


The following table summarizes our operating revenues for our products and services, which are described in each of the subsequent operating segment discussions:

U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation Segment

Our
U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment consists of:

•

asset
accumulation operations, which provide retirement savings and related investment products and services to businesses, their employees and other individuals; and

•

Principal
Global Investors, our U.S.-based asset manager.

For
financial results for the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 18 Segment Information."

U.S. Asset Accumulation

Our asset accumulation activities in the U.S. date back to the 1940s when we first began providing pension plan products and services. We now offer a
comprehensive portfolio of asset accumulation products and services for retirement savings and investment:

•

To
businesses of all sizes with a concentration on small and medium-sized businesses, which we define as businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, we offer products and
services for defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans, non-qualified executive benefit plans, and employee stock ownership plan
("ESOP") consulting services. For more basic investment needs, we offer SIMPLE IRA and payroll deduction plans;

•

To
large institutional clients, we also offer investment-only products, including guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements; and

•

To
employees of businesses and other individuals, we offer the ability to accumulate funds for retirement and savings through mutual funds, individual annuities and bank
products.

We
organize our U.S. asset accumulation operations into six product and service categories: full-service accumulation, full-service payout, investment only,
mutual funds, individual annuities and Principal Bank.


Full-Service Accumulation

Products

We offer a wide variety of investment and administrative products for defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit
pension plans, non-qualified executive benefit plans, and ESOPs. A 403(b) plan is a plan described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides retirement benefits
for employees of tax-exempt organizations and public schools.

Full-service
accumulation products respond to the needs of plan sponsors seeking both administrative and investment services for defined contribution plans or defined benefit
plans. The investment component of both the defined contribution and defined benefit plans may be in the form of a general account, separate account or a mutual fund offering.

As
of December 31, 2005, we provided full-service accumulation products to 31,756 defined contribution pension plans, of which 26,298 were 401(k) plans, covering
2.7 million plan participants, and to 2,808 defined benefit pension plans, covering 298,328 plan participants. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 60% of our full-service
accumulation account values were managed by Principal Global Investors. Third-party asset managers provide asset management services with respect to the remaining assets.

We
deliver both administrative and investment services to our defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan customers through annuities and mutual funds. Annuities and the
underlying investment options are not required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Our mutual fund offering is called Principal Advantage. It is a qualified plan
product based on our series mutual fund, Principal Investors Fund, and is a registered product with the SEC. We offer investments covering the full range of stable value, equity, fixed income and
international investment options managed by our affiliated asset manager, Principal Global Investors, as well as third-party asset managers.

On
December 17, 2004, we entered into a strategic agreement to acquire ABN AMRO Trust Services Company ("Principal Services Trust Company"), the Chicago-based pension and
retirement business of ABN AMRO. Principal Services Trust Company provides full-service defined contribution recordkeeping and investment services in the U.S., administering approximately
280 401(k) plans with more than 120,000 participants, representing $4.0 billion in full-service account values as of December 31, 2004. The transaction closed on
December 31, 2004. We are currently in the process of integrating this business into full-service accumulation with plans to be complete by early 2006.

Markets and Distribution

We offer our full-service accumulation products and services to employer-sponsored pension plans, including qualified and non-qualified
defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Our primary target market is plans sponsored by small and medium-sized businesses, which we believe remains under-penetrated. Only 19% of
businesses with between 5 and 99 employees, and 36% of businesses with between 100 and 500 employees, offered a 401(k) plan in 2005, according to Spectrem Group. The same study indicates that 65% of
employers with between 500 and 1,000 employees and 82% of employers with 1,000 or more employees offered a 401(k) plan in 2005.

We
distribute our full-service accumulation products and services nationally, primarily through a captive retirement services sales force. As of December 31, 2005,
approximately 303 retirement services sales representatives in over 45 offices, operating as a wholesale distribution network, maintained relationships with over 8,829 independent brokers, consultants
and agents. Retirement services sales representatives are an integral part of the sales process alongside the referring consultant or independent broker. We compensate retirement services sales
representatives through a blend of salary and production-based incentives, while we pay independent brokers, consultants and agents a commission or fee.

As
of December 31, 2005, we had a separate staff of over 214 service representatives located in the sales offices who play a key role in the ongoing servicing of pension plans by:
providing local services to our customers, such as reviewing plan performance, investment options and plan design; communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us; and helping employees
understand the benefits of their pension plans.

We
believe that our approach to full-service accumulation plan services distribution gives us a local sales and service presence that differentiates us from many of our
competitors. We have also recently established a number of marketing and distribution relationships to increase the sales of our accumulation products with firms such as A.G. Edwards, Mercer Human
Resource Consulting, Northwestern Mutual and UBS.

We
distribute our annuity-based products through sales representatives, agents and brokers who are primarily state licensed individuals.

Principal
Advantage, our mutual fund-based product, is targeted at defined contribution plans through broker/dealer distribution channels. Principal Advantage gives us access
to National Association of Securities Dealers-registered distributors who are not traditional sellers of annuity-based products and broadens opportunities for us in the investment advisor and
broker-dealer distribution channels.


Principal
Security Builder Retirement Program Individual 401(k) is the newest retirement plan solution from the Principal Financial Group. It was created for the small business owner
giving them a low-cost retirement program that allows them to save on taxes while saving for retirement. The Principal Security Builder Retirement Program Individual 401(k) is available
through the group annuity contract.

Impact401k.com
is our self-service Internet site, through which plan sponsors can handle the purchase, enrollment and administration of a 401(k) pension plan entirely through
the Internet. Impact401k.com allows plan participants to gain on-line access to their accounts, transfer funds between accounts and review customized investment options. Accordingly, our
employees do not have to perform any administrative activities. Impact401k.com is targeted at smaller businesses that seek a low cost product, as well as businesses of any size that prefer to handle
administrative activities through the Internet.

Full-Service Payout

Products

Full-service payout products respond to the needs of pension plan participants who, upon retirement or termination of their employment, seek a
guaranteed income stream. Plan participants who seek these services include those from pension plans we service, as well as pension plans other providers service. We primarily offer single premium
group annuities, which are immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. These are available to defined contribution and defined
benefit plan participants. We make regular payments to individuals, invest the underlying assets on their behalf and provide tax reporting to them. We also reinsure single premium immediate annuities
issued by another insurer.

Single
premium group annuities are traditionally used in conjunction with defined benefit plans, particularly those where the plan is being terminated. In such instances, the plan
sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Increasingly, these products are purchased by defined contribution plan participants who reach retirement
age. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor has mandated that annuities be
purchased only from the "safest available" insurers.

Premium
received from full-service payout products are generally in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new premiums can fluctuate depending on the number
of retirements and large-scale annuity sales in a particular fiscal quarter. Our affiliated asset manager, Principal Global Investors, manages the assets supporting full-service payout
account values.

Markets and Distribution

Our primary distribution channel for full-service payout products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants working through
consultants and brokers that specialize in this type of business. Our sales consultants also make sales directly to institutions. Our nationally dispersed retirement services sales representatives act
as a secondary distribution channel for these products. Principal Connection also distributes full-service payout products to participants in plans we service who are terminating
employment or retiring. Principal Connection is our direct response distribution channel for retail financial services products to individuals. Principal Connection's services are available over the
phone, on the Internet or by mail.

Investment Only

Products

The three primary products for which we provide investment-only services are: guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs"); funding agreements; and other
investment-only products.

GICs
and funding agreements pay a specified rate of return. The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment-only
products contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.

Deposits
to investment-only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to
another. Assets invested in GICs and funding agreements generate a spread between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. Our other investment-only
products consist of separate accounts invested in either equities or fixed income instruments. Our affiliated asset manager, Principal Global Investors, manages the assets supporting
investment-only account values.

Markets and Distribution

We market GICs and funding agreements primarily to pension plan sponsors and other institutions. We also offer them as part of our full-service
accumulation products. We sell our GICs primarily to plan sponsors for funding of tax-qualified retirement plans. We sell our funding agreements directly to institutions that may or may
not be pension


funds
and unconsolidated special purpose vehicles domiciled either in the U.S. or offshore for funding agreement-backed note programs. The funding agreements sold as part of these funding
agreement-backed note programs work by having investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose vehicle, which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms similar to those
of the debt obligations. The strength of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to another. In
addition to the special purpose vehicle selling the funding agreement-backed notes to U.S. and foreign institutional investors, the special purpose vehicle may also sell notes to U.S. retail investors
through a SEC-registered shelf debt issuance program.

Mutual Funds

We have been providing mutual funds to customers since 1969. We offer mutual funds to individuals, businesses, and institutional investors for use within variable
life and variable annuity contracts, for use in employer-sponsored pension plans, as a rollover investment option, and for general investment purposes.

Products

We were ranked in the top quartile among U.S. mutual fund managers in terms of total mutual fund assets under management as of November 30, 2005, according
to the Investment Company Institute. The value of our mutual fund assets we managed was $25.1 billion as of December 31, 2005. We provide accounting, compliance, corporate governance,
product development and transfer agency functions for all mutual funds we organize. As of December 31, 2005, our mutual fund operations served approximately 973,000 mutual fund shareholder
accounts.

Principal Variable Contracts Fund.

Principal Variable Contracts Fund is a series mutual fund, which,
as of December 31, 2005, provided 31 investment options for use as funding choices in variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by Principal Life. As of December 31,
2005, this fund had $3.9 billion in assets under management. We report the results for the funds backing variable annuity contracts in this segment under "Individual Annuities." We report the
results for the funds backing variable life insurance contracts in the Life and Health Insurance segment.

Principal Investors Fund.

Principal Investors Fund is a series mutual fund, which as of
December 31, 2005, offered 55 investment options. This fund acts as the funding vehicle for Principal Advantage, the defined contribution product described above under "U.S. Asset Management
and Accumulation Segment-Full-Service Accumulation Products." This fund also offers retail classes of shares ("J shares") to individuals for IRA rollovers and general
investment purposes and a class of shares ("I shares") offered primarily to specified institutional investors. As of July 1, 2005, two retail classes from the Principal Mutual Funds merged with
Principal Investors Fund under new A and B share classes and continue to be offered to individuals and businesses. As of December 31, 2005, this retail class of shares had $6.7 billion
in assets under management; $0.7 billion of this retail class invests in other share classes of Principal Investors Funds. All other share classes of Principal Investors Funds, including seed
money, had $14.5 billion of assets under management. We report the results for this fund, excluding the retail class of shares, under "Full-Service Accumulation." We report the
results of the three retail share classes under "Mutual Funds."

Principal Managed Portfolio.

Principal Managed Portfolio is a wrap product offered by our registered
investment advisor, Princor Financial Services Corporation ("Princor"), which only invests in Principal Investors Funds. We started to market this product in mid-2005. Clients are charged
a quarterly asset based fee on this account. As of December 31, 2005, Principal Managed Portfolio had accumulated $94.3 million in assets.

Principal Passage Fee Based Brokerage Account.

Principal Passage is a fee based brokerage account.
Clients are charged a quarterly asset based fee on their account in lieu of traditional transaction based commissions. As of December 31, 2005, Principal Passage accounts had accumulated
$1.2 billion in assets.

Markets and Distribution

Our markets for retail mutual funds are individuals seeking to accumulate savings for retirement and other purposes and small businesses seeking to use mutual
funds as the funding vehicle for pension plans, as well as non-qualified individual savings plans utilizing payroll deductions. We also market our retail mutual funds to participants in
pension plans who are departing their plans and reinvesting their retirement assets into individual retirement accounts.

Our
retail mutual funds are sold primarily through our affiliated financial representatives, independent brokers registered with our securities broker-dealer, Princor, registered
representatives from other broker-dealers, direct deposits from our employees and others and Principal Connection. Princor, as the marketing arm of our mutual fund business, recruits, trains and
supervises registered representatives selling our products.

Individual Annuities

Individual annuities offer a tax-deferred means of accumulating retirement savings and provide a tax-efficient source of income during the
payout period.


Products

We offer both fixed and variable annuities to individuals and pension plans. Individual annuities may be categorized in two ways: (1) deferred, in which
case assets accumulate until the contract is surrendered, the customer dies or the customer begins receiving benefits under an annuity payout option, or (2) immediate, in which case payments
begin within one year of issue and continue for a fixed period of time or for life.

Fixed Deferred Annuities.

Our individual fixed deferred annuities consist of both single premium
deferred annuity contracts ("SPDAs") and flexible premium deferred annuity contracts ("FPDAs"). Some FPDA contracts limit the period of time deposits are allowed (i.e. only one year). For most
contracts, the principal amount is guaranteed. We credit the customer's account with a fixed interest rate and for a specified time period, typically one year. Thereafter, we reset, typically
annually, the interest rate credited to the contract based upon our discretion, taking into account market and other conditions. We also offer a fixed deferred annuity where the interest credited is
linked to an external equity index, subject to maximum and minimum values. Our major source of income from fixed deferred annuities is the spread between the investment income earned on the underlying
general account assets and the interest rate credited to the contracts. We bear the investment risk because, while we credit customers' accounts with a stated interest rate, we cannot be certain the
investment income we earn on our general account assets will exceed that rate. Our affiliated asset manager, Principal Global Investors, manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Variable Deferred Annuities.

Our individual variable deferred annuity products consist almost
entirely of flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts. These contracts are savings vehicles through which the customer makes a single deposit or a series of deposits of varying amounts and
intervals. Customers have the flexibility to allocate
their deposits to investment sub-accounts managed by Principal Global Investors, or other third-party asset managers. As of December 31, 2005, 67% of our $4.0 billion in
variable annuity account balances was allocated to investment sub-accounts and our general account, which are managed by Principal Global Investors and 33% to investment
sub-accounts managed by third-party asset managers. Generally speaking, the customers bear the investment risk and have the right to allocate their assets among various separate investment
sub-accounts. The value of the annuity fluctuates in accordance with the experience of the investment sub-accounts chosen by the customer. Customers have the option to allocate
all or a portion of their account to our general account, in which case we credit interest at rates we determine, subject to contractual minimums. Customers may also elect death benefit guarantees
and/or a living benefit guarantee, commonly known in the industry as a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB"). The GMWB feature became available in 2005. Our major source of revenue from
variable annuities is mortality and expense fees we charge to the customer, generally determined as a percentage of the market value of the assets held in a separate investment
sub-account.

Fixed Immediate Annuities.

Our individual fixed immediate annuities consist almost exclusively of
single premium immediate annuity contracts ("SPIAs"). SPIAs are products where the customer makes a single deposit, and from which periodic benefit payments are made. Payments may be contingent upon
the survival of one or two individuals, or payments may be fixed, meaning payments are contractually guaranteed and do not depend on the continuing survival of any individual. Our major source of
income from fixed immediate annuities is the spread between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets, and the interest rate implied in the calculation of annuity benefit
payments. We bear the investment risk because we cannot be certain the investment income we earn on our general account assets will exceed the rate implied in the SPIA contracts. Our affiliated asset
manager, Principal Global Investors, manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Markets and Distribution

Our target markets for individual annuities include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses, and individuals seeking to accumulate
and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market both fixed and variable annuities to both qualified and non-qualified pension plans.

We
sell our individual annuity products through our affiliated financial representatives, who accounted for 43%, 35%, and 50% of annuity sales for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The remaining sales were made through brokerage general agencies, banks, mutual fund companies, Principal Connection and unaffiliated broker-dealer firms. Although
our percentage of sales from affiliated financial representatives has declined, they continued to be significant in 2005. The decline is a result of focused efforts to increase fixed annuity sales
through non-affiliated distribution channels.

International Asset Management and Accumulation Segment

Our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment consists of Principal International, which has operations in Chile, Mexico, Hong Kong, Brazil, India,
China and Malaysia. We focus on countries with favorable demographics and a trend toward private sector defined contribution pension systems. We entered these countries through acquisitions,
start-up operations and joint ventures.

On
May 26, 2005, we announced jointly with our partner, ING, the intent to liquidate the ING/Principal Pensions Company, Ltd. operation in Japan. On December 20,
2005, the liquidation process was completed with a formal liquidation filing to the Japanese corporate registry.

The
decision to liquidate the ING/Principal Pensions Company, Ltd. operation in Japan followed a careful evaluation of the joint venture's activities and its prospects for further
growth in the Japanese market. After consideration of all the issues, both ING and The Principal determined that the market for defined contribution pensions was unlikely to meet initial expectations.

On
July 2, 2004, we closed the sale of Principal International Argentina S.A. ("PI Argentina"), our subsidiary in Argentina, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Principal Life
Compania de Seguros, S.A. and Principal Retiro Compania de Seguros de Retiro, S.A. Our total after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately U.S. $29.2 million.

The
decision to sell PI Argentina was made with a view toward focusing our resources, executing on core strategic priorities and in core markets, and meeting stockholder expectations.
Changing market dynamics since the 2001 economic crisis in Argentina led us to conclude that the interests of Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s stockholders would best be served by our exit of
this market.

PI
Argentina qualifies for discontinued operations treatment under SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

("SFAS 144"), therefore, the results of operations have been removed from our results of continuing operations and segment operating earnings for all periods
presented. All assets, including cash, and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been reclassified to separate discontinued asset and liability line items on the consolidated statements of
financial position. The consolidated statements of cash flows include proceeds from the sale but exclude any operating, investing and financing activity related to these discontinued operations. The
results of operations for PI Argentina are reported as other after-tax adjustments in our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment

On
October 31, 2002, we sold substantially all of BT Financial Group to Westpac Banking Corporation ("Westpac"). As of December 31, 2005, we have received proceeds of
A$958.9 million Australian dollars ("A$") (U.S. $537.4 million) from Westpac. Our total after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately U.S. $900.0 million. This
amount includes cash proceeds from Westpac, tax benefits and gain from unwinding the hedged asset associated with our investment in BT Financial Group.

The
decision to sell BT Financial Group was made with a view toward focusing our resources, executing on core strategic priorities and meeting stockholder expectations. Changing market
dynamics since our acquisition of BT Financial Group, including industry consolidation, led us to conclude that the interests of BT Financial Group clients and staff would be best served under
Westpac's ownership.

BT
Financial Group is accounted for as a discontinued operation and therefore, the results of operations have been removed from our results of continuing operations and segment operating
earnings for all periods presented. All assets, including cash, and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been reclassified to separate discontinued asset and liability line items on the
consolidated statements of financial position. The consolidated statements of cash flows include proceeds from the sale but exclude any operating, investing and financing activity related to these
discontinued operations. The results of operations (excluding corporate overhead) for BT Financial Group are reported as other after-tax adjustments in 2003 and prior years in our
International Asset Management and Accumulation segment.

financial results for the International Asset Management and Accumulation segment see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 18 Segment Information."

Hong Kong.

Our subsidiary in Hong Kong is actively competing in the defined contribution pension plan
market. The government requires employers and employees each to contribute 5% of an employee's income to a Mandatory


Provident
Fund. We target small and medium-sized employers and distribute products through strategic alliances with insurance companies, mutual funds or banks, direct marketing and through our own
sales representatives. Our strategic partners help distribute our Mandatory Provident Fund products and services, or use our administrative and investment services in their own products. Our Mandatory
Provident Fund products and services are marketed by agents under the various distribution arrangements we have with our strategic partners. On January 31, 2004, our wholly owned subsidiary,
Principal Asset Management Company (Asia) Limited, purchased a 100% ownership of Dao Heng Fund Management in Hong Kong from Guoco Group Limited. Effective September 17, 2004, we changed the

our long-term mutual fund operations.

India.

We own 65% of Principal PNB Asset Management Company in India. This company competes in the
mutual fund market, managing and administering funds for both individuals and corporations. We sell our mutual funds through regional offices and regional bank branches located throughout India. In

India. We closed the transaction on May 5, 2004. The new company is called Principal PNB Asset Management Company. As part of this transaction, we rolled our then existing fund management
company, Principal Asset Management Company, into the joint venture. We retained 65% of the new company, sold 30% to PNB, who merged their own PNB funds into the new company, and 5% to Vijaya Bank.

On

Life and Health Insurance Segment

group dental, group vision, group life, group long-term and short-term disability and individual disability insurance throughout the U.S. We focus on providing comprehensive
insurance solutions for small-to-medium sized businesses.

For
financial results for the Life and Health Insurance segment see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18
Segment Information."

Individual Life Insurance

We began as an individual life insurer in 1879. Our U.S. operations administer approximately 632,000 individual life insurance policies with $102.6 billion
of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2005. As of September 30, 2005, our life insurance business was ranked 23rd in the United States for annualized sales according
to LIMRA.

Products and Services

We offer a variety of individual life insurance products, including universal and variable universal life insurance and term life insurance, with a focus on using
these products for nonqualified executive benefits for small-to-medium sized businesses.

Nonqualified Executive Benefits.

Small and medium-sized companies are challenged with how to build
quality benefits packages for executives, how to transition the company's ownership to a partner or family member and how to save the amount of money they desire for retirement. Executives and other
key employees often have personal insurance needs. These needs are the focus of our products within the individual life insurance arena. In 2001, we enhanced our ability to provide these services by
acquiring Executive Benefit Services, Inc., ("EBS") a Raleigh, North Carolina-based company specializing in the marketing, sale, implementation and administration of executive benefit plans. In
2005, we rebranded EBS to more strongly reflect the Principal name.

We
have a growing focus and expertise in providing executive life insurance benefits to companies designated by the Internal Revenue Service as S-corporations, in addition to
traditional C-corporation clients. As a growing segment of the small-to-medium sized business market, S-corporations require unique plan designs that
meet very specific legal requirements.

Universal and Variable Universal Life Insurance.

Universal and variable universal life insurance
products offer life insurance protection for which both the premium and the death benefit may be adjusted by the policyholder. Universal life insurance usually includes a cash value account that
accumulates at a floating interest rate, with a minimum rate guarantee. Variable life insurance substitutes various investment options for the single floating interest rate of universal life
insurance.

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, 89% of individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales have come from universal and variable universal life insurance products.
Universal and variable universal life insurance represent 50% of individual life insurance premium and deposits for the year ended December 31, 2005, and 43% of individual life insurance in
force as of December 31, 2005. Variable universal life insurance products represented 38% of our universal and variable universal life insurance deposits for the year ended December 31,
2005.

After
removing expenses for a policy, we credit net deposits to an account maintained for the policyholder. For universal life contracts, the entire account balance is invested in our
general account. Interest is credited to the policyholder's account based on the earnings on general account investments. For variable universal life contracts, the policyholder may allocate the
account balance among our general account and a variety of separate account choices. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the general account in the same manner as for universal life. Net
investment


performance
on separate account investments is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts; the policyholder bears the investment risk. Some of our universal life and variable universal life
insurance contracts contain what are commonly referred to as "secondary" or "no-lapse guarantee" provisions. A no-lapse guarantee keeps the contract in force, even if the
contractholder's account balance is insufficient to cover all of the contract charges, provided that the contractholder has continually paid a specified minimum premium.

Traditional Life Insurance.

Traditional life insurance includes participating whole life, adjustable
life products and term life insurance products. Participating products and term life insurance products represented 7% and 4%, respectively, of our individual life insurance annualized first year
premium sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, and 35% and 22%, respectively, of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2005. Adjustable life insurance products
provide a guaranteed benefit in return for the payment of a fixed premium and allow the policyholder to change the premium and face amount combination. Term insurance products provide a guaranteed
death benefit for a specified period of time in return for the payment of a fixed premium. Policy dividends are not paid on term insurance.

Group Health Insurance

We began offering group health insurance in 1941. We offer a variety of group medical insurance products, including high deductible health plans with health
savings accounts. We also provide administrative services on a fee-for-service basis for medical, dental, disability, vision, and wellness benefits.

Products and Services

Our group health insurance products described below provide appropriate interactions for members along a continuum of care management, from wellness services to
acute and chronic care and disease management programs. These programs include care management, a transplant network, chronic disease management, pre-natal assistance and
24-hour access to online health management resources such as symptom checkers, prescription drug information and provider information.

Group Health Insurance.

As of December 31, 2005, we provided group medical insurance benefits
to more than 21,000 employer customers and their 620,000 employees and dependents. Our traditional group medical insurance plans
provide reimbursement of medical expenses for insured employees and their dependents. These members are responsible for deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance. Our products
are well-positioned to address our members' preferences for a variety of provider choices and preferred provider discounts. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, HealthRisk Resource
Group, Inc., we negotiate discounts with providers on claims for which we have no other pre-arranged discount.

Our
consumer-driven health care plans offer greater flexibility for employers and more opportunity for members to take charge of their health and health care. The Principal Health
Savings Account ("HSA") can be funded by employers and employee members. Money can be contributed pre-tax and grows tax free. Funds can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses tax
free. The account is portable from job to job or from work to retirement. The Principal HSA is coupled with a high deductible health plan, typically either insured or administered by Principal Life.
The Principal HSA features a checking account with a debit card through Principal Bank and investment options through Princor Financial Services Corporation. Because of these internal resources and
expertise, we are uniquely positioned to offer a competitive and high-quality health savings account plan and high deductible health plan.

Fee-for-Service.

We offer administration of group medical, dental,
disability, and vision benefits on a fee-for-service basis to almost 400 self-insured employers and their nearly 1.2 million employees and dependents as of
December 31, 2005. The acquisition of J.F. Molloy and Associates in 2004 added 106 self-insured employers.

We
also recognize the importance of promoting healthy behavior. Our first quarter 2004 acquisition of J.F. Molloy and Associates included Molloy Wellness Company. The wellness company,
now known as Principal Wellness Company, brought expertise in providing wellness screenings, counseling and services to employers and their employees, demonstrating health improvement through reduced
health insurance claim costs, reduced absenteeism and increased employee productivity. This preventative focus is currently being integrated into both our fully-insured and
fee-for-service offerings. We provide wellness services to almost 300 employers.

Specialty Benefits

Specialty Benefits, including group dental, vision and life insurance, as well as individual and group disability insurance, are an important component of the
employee benefit offering at small-to-medium size businesses. We offer both traditional employer sponsored and voluntary products for group dental, life, and disability. We
began selling our first specialty benefit products in 1941 with group disability and group life insurance. We began selling individual disability insurance in 1952 and group dental and group vision
insurance in the late 1960's.

Products and Services

Group Dental and Vision Insurance.

Group dental and vision insurance plans provide partial
reimbursement for dental and vision expenses. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 36,000 group dental and vision insurance


policies
in force covering almost 830,000 lives. According to LIMRA, we were the third largest group dental insurer in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force in 2004. In addition to
indemnity and PPO dental, we offer a prepaid dental plan in Arizona through our Dental-Net, Inc. subsidiary.

Group Life Insurance.

Group life insurance provides coverage to employees and their dependents for a
specified period. As of December 31, 2005, we had over 52,000 group policies providing $93.6 billion of group life insurance in force to approximately 2.0 million lives. According
to LIMRA in 2004, we were ranked second in the U.S. in terms of the number of life insurance contracts in force and fifth in terms of the number of contracts sold. We currently sell traditional group
life insurance that does not provide for accumulation of cash values. Our group life insurance business remains focused on the traditional, annually renewable term product. Group term life and group
universal life accounted for 93% and 7% respectively of our total group life insurance in force as of December 31, 2005. As of January 1, 2004, we no longer market group universal life
insurance to new employer groups.

Group Disability Insurance.

Group disability insurance provides a benefit to insured employees who
become disabled. Our group disability products include both short-term and long-term disability. Long-term disability represents 38% of total group and individual
disability premium, while short-term disability represents 23% of total group and individual disability premium. In addition, we provide disability management services, also called
rehabilitation services, to assist individuals in returning to work as quickly as possible following disability. We also work with disability claimants to improve the approval rate of Social Security
benefits, thereby reducing payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received. As of December 31, 2005, we served approximately 1.1 million employee lives within more
than 26,000 contracts, with our group short-term disability business being ranked fourth and our group long-term disability business being ranked seventh in the U.S. as of
December 31, 2004, in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force, according to LIMRA.

Individual Disability Insurance.

Individual disability insurance products provide a benefit to the
insured member in the event he/she becomes disabled. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. Individual disability income represents 39% of total group and individual
disability premium. In addition to income replacement, we offer products to pay business overhead expenses for a disabled business owner, and for the purchase by the other business owners of the
disabled business owner's interests in the business. As of December 31, 2005, we served approximately 97,000 individual disability policyholders, with our individual disability business being
ranked seventh in the U.S. as of December 31, 2004, in terms of premium in force, according to LIMRA.

Life and Health Markets and Distribution

For each of our products, the administration of that product and the distribution channel through which it is marketed and sold is customized to meet customer
needs and expectations for that product.

We
sell our individual life and individual disability income products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, primarily targeting owners and executives of small and medium-sized
businesses. Small and medium-sized business sales represented 69% of individual life sales and 64% of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, based on first year
annualized premium.

We
distribute our individual insurance products through our affiliated financial representatives and independent brokers, as well as other marketing and distribution alliances.
Affiliated financial representatives were responsible for 38% of individual life insurance sales based on first year annualized premium and 15% of individual disability sales for the year ended
December 31, 2005. We had 1,009 affiliated financial representatives in 30 offices. Although they are independent contractors, we have a close tie with affiliated financial representatives and
offer them benefits, training and access to tools and expertise. For individual disability insurance, non-affiliated financial representatives accounted for 85% of total sales for the year
ended December 31, 2005. A key differentiator in the nonqualified executive benefit sale is our Advance Planning Regional Vice Presidents, who are not only wholesalers but also consultants and
subject-matter experts providing point-of-sale support in closing cases.

We
market our group medical, life, disability, dental and vision insurance products to small and medium-sized businesses, primarily targeting our sales toward owners and human resources
professionals. We sell our group life, disability and dental products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We sell vision coverage in 48 states, plus the District of Columbia. We sell our
group medical insurance in 35 states and the District of Columbia with a growing focus on 13 states that we consider to have the best competitive environments. They are also considered to be
attractive markets because of a lack of deep penetration by HMOs and a favorable regulatory environment. We continually adapt our products and pricing to meet local market conditions. We market our
fee-for-service capabilities to employers that self-insure their employees' benefits. We sell our fee-for-service business in all 50 states
and the District of Columbia.

Group
insurance and fee-for-service products are distributed through independent benefit brokers, consultants, financial planners and the same channels that sell
our U.S. asset accumulation products. To reach these marketers, we employ three types of wholesale distributors: our medical sales representatives, our non-medical sales representatives
(for Specialty Benefits products) and two independent wholesale organizations, Rogers Benefit Group and Excelsior Benefits, dedicated to marketing group medical, life, disability, dental and vision
insurance products. We have also formed a number of strategic distribution alliances with national brokerages and regional brokerage agencies.


As of December 31, 2005, we had 121 medical and non-medical sales representatives and 100 service representatives in 42 offices. Our medical and
non-medical sales representatives accounted for 71% of our group insurance sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The group sales force plays a key role in the ongoing
servicing of the case by providing local, responsive services to our customers and their brokers, such as renewing contracts, revising plans and solving any administrative issues; communicating the
customers' needs and feedback to us; and helping employees understand the benefits of their plans.

Rogers
Benefit Group is a marketing and service organization that represents major high quality insurance carriers specializing in group medical, life, disability and dental insurance
plans. Our relationship with Rogers Benefit Group dates back to its creation in 1970. It accounted for 28% of our group insurance sales for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Excelsior
Benefits is a marketing organization specializing in group medical, life, disability, and dental insurance plans. We entered into our relationship with Excelsior Benefits
beginning in November 2003. It accounted for 1% of sales in 2005.

Corporate and Other Segment

Our Corporate and Other segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate and
Other segment primarily reflect our financing activities (including interest expense), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain
income, expenses and other after-tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items.

For
financial results for Corporate and Other see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18 Segment
Information".

Competition

Competition in our operating segments is based on a number of factors including: service, product features, price, investment performance, commission structure,
distribution capacity, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete for customers and distributors with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, mutual funds,
broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, more
competitive pricing, greater diversity of distribution sources, better brand recognition or, with respect to insurers, higher financial strength ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources
with which to compete or may have better investment performance at various times.

Competition
in the retirement services market is very fragmented. Our main competitors in this market include Fidelity, Nationwide, AXA, Mass Mutual and Manulife. We believe the
infrastructure and system support needed to meet the needs of the small and medium-sized business market is a significant barrier to entry for our competitors. Many of our competitors in the mutual
fund industry are larger, have been established for a longer period of time, offer less expensive products, have deeper penetration in key distribution channels and have more resources than we do.
There were over 8,044 mutual funds in the U.S. as of December 31, 2004 according to the Investment Company Institute 2005 Mutual Fund Fact Book. The institutional asset management market has
grown at a rapid pace over the last decade. Our primary competitors in this market are large institutional asset management firms, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and
T. Rowe Price, some of which offer a broader array of investment products and services and are better known. The asset management business has relatively few barriers to entry and continually attracts
new entrants. The variable annuity market is also highly competitive. As we expand into additional distribution channels for this product, we will face strong competition from Nationwide and Hartford.
Competition in the international markets in which we operate comes primarily from local financial services firms and other international companies operating on a stand-alone basis or in a partnership
with local firms, including ING, AXA, Allianz and AIG. In the highly competitive life and health insurance business, our competitors include other insurers such as UNUM, Guardian, Northwestern Mutual
Life, Manulife, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, and health maintenance organizations such as United Health Care and Aetna. We believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through
our:

•

full-service
platform;

•

strong
customer relationships;

•

focus
on financial performance; and

•

performance-oriented
culture.

Ratings

Insurance companies are assigned financial strength ratings by rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders. Ratings provide both industry
participants and insurance consumers meaningful information on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims.


Principal
Life has been assigned the following long-term insurance financial strength ratings:

Rating Agency

Financial Strength Rating

Rating Structure

A.M. Best Company, Inc.

A+ ("Superior") with a stable outlook

Second highest of 16 rating levels

Fitch Ratings

AA ("Very Strong") with a stable outlook

Third highest of 24 rating levels

Moody's Investors Service

Aa2 ("Excellent") with a stable outlook

Third highest of 21 rating levels

Standard & Poor's Rating Services

AA ("Very Strong") with a stable outlook

Third highest of 21 rating levels

A.M. Best's ratings for insurance companies range from "A++" to "S". A.M. Best indicates that "A++" and "A+" ratings are assigned to those companies that
in A.M. Best's opinion have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life insurance industry and have demonstrated a strong ability to meet their policyholder and
other contractual obligations. Fitch's ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "D". Fitch indicates that "AA" ratings are assigned to those companies that have demonstrated financial
strength and a very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contractholder obligations on a timely basis. Moody's ratings for insurance companies range from "Aaa" to "C". Moody's indicates that "Aa
("Excellent")" ratings are assigned to those companies that have demonstrated excellent financial security. Standard & Poor's ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "R".
Standard & Poor's indicates that "AA" ratings are assigned to those companies that have demonstrated very strong financial security. In evaluating a company's financial and operating
performance, these rating agencies review its profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market
value of its assets, the adequacy of its policy reserves, the experience and competency of its management and other factors.

We
believe that our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to our distributors and customers, since ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally
used throughout the industry. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and are not
evaluations directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security, including our common stock.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we had 14,507 employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing employment with us. We
believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.

Internet Website

Our Internet website can be found at www.principal.com. We make available free of charge on or through our Internet website, access to our annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also available free of
charge on our Internet website and in print to any requesting stockholder is our code of business conduct and ethics, corporate governance guidelines, and charters for the audit, human resources and
nominating and governance committees of our board of directors. Also see Item 10, "Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant."

Item 1A. Risk Factors

A decline or increased volatility in the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rates of investment, either of which
could reduce our net income, revenues and assets under management.

Favorable
performance by the U.S. and international securities markets increases investments in these markets and benefits our asset management and accumulation businesses and increases
our assets under management. Because the revenues of our asset management businesses are, to a large extent, based on the value of assets under management, a decline in these securities markets would
decrease our revenues. Turmoil in these securities markets could lead investors to withdraw from these markets, decrease their rates of investment or refrain from making new investments which may
reduce our net income, revenues and assets under management.

Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks which may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our sales, profitability and the investment returns credited
to our customers.

An increase in defaults on our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our profitability.

We are subject to the risk that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities we own will default on principal and interest payments, particularly if a major
downturn in economic activity occurs. As of December 31, 2005, our U.S.investment operations held $40.1 billion of fixed maturity securities, or 74% of total U.S. invested assets, of
which approximately


5.4%
were below investment grade, including $143.6 million, or 0.4% of our total fixed maturity securities which we classified as either "problem," "potential problem," or "restructured." See
"Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — U.S. Investment Operations —
U.S. Investment Results — Fixed Maturity Securities." As of December 31, 2005, our international investment operations held $2.1 billion of fixed maturity securities,
or 69% of total international invested assets. Some of these securities have been rated on the basis of the issuer's country credit rating while others have not been rated by external agencies, which
makes the assessment of credit quality more difficult. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments —
International Investment Operations." An increase in defaults on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.

An increased rate of delinquency and defaults on our commercial mortgage loans, especially those with balloon payments, could decrease our profitability.

Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio faces both delinquency and default risk. Commercial mortgage loans of $9.9 billion represented 17% of our total
invested assets as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, loans that were either delinquent or in the process of foreclosure totaled, on a statutory basis, $10.1 million,
or 0.1% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, compared to the industry average of 0.1% as reported by the American Council of Life Insurers as of December 31, 2005. The performance of our
commercial mortgage loan portfolio, however, may fluctuate in the future. An increase in the delinquency rate of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio could harm our financial strength and decrease
our profitability.

As
of December 31, 2005, approximately $8.1 billion, or 81%, of our commercial mortgage loans before valuation allowance had balloon payment maturities. A balloon maturity
is a loan with larger dollar amounts of payments becoming due in the later years of the loan. The default rate on commercial mortgage loans with balloon payment maturities has historically been higher
than for commercial mortgage loans with standard repayment schedules. Since most of the principal is being repaid at maturity, the amount of loss on a default is generally greater than on other
commercial mortgage loans. An increase in defaults on such loans as a result of the foregoing factors could harm our financial strength and reduce our net income.

We may have difficulty selling our privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments because they are less liquid than our publicly traded fixed
maturity securities.

As of December 31, 2005, our privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments represented approximately
40% of the value of our invested assets. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices, in a timely manner, or both.

Derivative instruments may not be honored by counterparties resulting in ineffective hedging of our risks.

We use derivative instruments to hedge various risks we face in our businesses. See Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
We enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, financial futures, currency swaps, currency forwards, credit default swaps, total return swaps, bond
forwards, mortgage-backed security forwards and options, with a number of counterparties. If, however, our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, we will have
failed to effectively hedge the related risk. That failure may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.

Environmental liability exposure may result from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments.

Liability under environmental protection laws resulting from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments may harm our financial strength
and reduce our profitability. Under the laws of several states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of cleanup. In some states, this
kind of lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property, which would impair our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in default. In addition,
under the laws of some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, we may be liable for costs of addressing releases or threatened
releases of hazardous substances that require remedy at a property securing a mortgage loan held by us, if our agents or employees have become sufficiently involved in the hazardous waste aspects of
the operations of the related obligor on that loan, regardless of whether or not the environmental damage or threat was caused by the obligor. We also may face this liability after foreclosing on a
property securing a mortgage loan held by us. This may harm our financial strength and decrease our profitability.

Regional concentration of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio in California may subject us to economic downturns or losses attributable to earthquakes in that state.

California accounted for 18%, or $1.8 billion, of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2005. Due to this concentration of
commercial mortgage loans in California, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of an economic downturn in California as well as to catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may
affect the region. While we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans, we do take into account property specific engineering reports,
construction type and geographical concentration by fault


lines
in our investment underwriting guidelines. If economic conditions in California deteriorate or catastrophes occur, we may experience delinquencies on the portion of our commercial mortgage loan
portfolio located in California in the future, which may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.

Competition from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance may impair our ability to
retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability.

We believe that our ability to compete is based on a number of factors including scale, service, product features, price, investment performance, commission
structure, distribution capabilities, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers, insurers and asset
managers, many of which have advantages over us in one or more of the above competitive factors.

Each
of our segments faces strong competition. The primary competitors for our U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment are asset managers, banks, broker-dealers and
insurers. Our ability to increase and retain assets under management is directly related to the performance of our investments as measured against market averages and the performance of our
competitors. Even when securities prices are generally rising, performance can be affected by investment styles. Principal Global Investors may also be at a disadvantage in competing for investment
management personnel due to its location in Des Moines.

Competition
for our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment comes primarily from local financial services firms and other international companies operating on a
stand-alone basis or in partnership with local firms. Our Life and Health Insurance segment competes with insurers and health maintenance organizations.

National
banks, with their large existing customer bases, may increasingly compete with insurers as a result of court rulings allowing national banks to sell annuity products in some
circumstances, and as a result of legislation removing restrictions on bank affiliations with insurers. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 permits mergers that combine commercial banks,
insurers and securities firms under one holding company. These developments may increase competition, in particular for our asset management and accumulation businesses, by substantially increasing
the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors who may be able to offer, due to economies of scale, more competitive pricing than we can.

A downgrade in any of our ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, reduce new sales and terminate relationships with distributors, and impact existing
liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.

Ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A rating downgrade, or the potential for such a downgrade, could,
among other things:

•

materially
increase the number of policy or contract surrenders for all or a portion of their net cash values and withdrawals by policyholders of cash values from their
policies or with respect to general account guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements purchased by pension plans and other institutions;

•

result
in the termination of our relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers and other distributors of our products and services;

•

reduce
new sales, particularly with respect to general account guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements purchased by pension plans and other institutions; and

•

cause
some of our existing liabilities to be subject to acceleration, additional collateral support, changes in terms, or creation of additional financial obligations.

Any
of these consequences could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.

Certain
aspects of our businesses help us mitigate potential liquidity risk:

•

Our
liability portfolio is diverse. Many of our products have fairly predictable cash demands, and where cash demands are less predictable, we have the ability to defer or
spread out the cash payments. Importantly, our products have features to discourage surrenders.

•

Our
asset portfolio is also diverse and spread over many different types of exposures (asset class, credit, geography, industry, etc.).

Our efforts to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our profitability and surplus may not be effective.

We attempt to significantly reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the profitability and surplus of our asset accumulation and life and health
insurance operations. We accomplish this reduction primarily by managing the duration of our assets relative to the duration of our liabilities. During a period of rising interest rates, policy
surrenders, withdrawals and requests for policy loans may increase as customers seek to achieve higher returns. Despite our efforts to reduce the impact of rising interest rates, we may be required to
sell assets to raise the cash necessary to respond to such


surrenders,
withdrawals and loans, thereby realizing capital losses on the assets sold. An increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals may also require us to accelerate amortization of policy
acquisition costs relating to these contracts, which would further reduce our net income.

During
periods of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay or redeem mortgages and bonds that we own, which would force us to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates. For
some of our products, such as guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements, we are unable to lower the rate we credit to customers in response to the lower return we will earn on our
investments. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to maintain our desired spread between the investment income we earn and the interest we credit to our customers during periods of declining
interest rates thereby reducing our profitability.

For
further discussion on interest rate risk management, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk".

If we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives and develop new distribution sources, sales of our products and services may be reduced.

We distribute our asset accumulation, asset management and life, health and specialty benefit insurance products and services through a variety of distribution
channels, including our own internal sales representatives, independent brokers, banks, broker-dealers and other third-party marketing organizations. We must attract and retain sales representatives
to sell our products. Strong competition exists among financial services companies for efficient sales representatives. We compete with other financial services companies for sales representatives
primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services and compensation and product features. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient sales representatives to sell our products,
our ability to compete and revenues from new sales would suffer.

Our international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that could reduce our profitability in those businesses.

Our international businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision from central and/or local governmental authorities in each country in which
we operate. New interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations may harm our international businesses and reduce our profitability in those businesses.

Our
international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in our operations in the U.S. We face the risk of discriminatory regulation,
nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they
operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some of our international businesses are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging or potentially volatile
markets. In addition, we rely on local staff, including local sales forces, in these countries and we may encounter labor problems especially in countries where workers' associations and trade unions
are strong. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in that country.

Our reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove inadequate, requiring us to increase liabilities.

Our earnings depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in setting prices for our products
and establishing liabilities for future insurance and annuity policy benefits and claims. The liability that we have established for future policy benefits is based on assumptions concerning a number
of factors, including the amount of premiums that we will receive in the future, rate of return on assets we purchase with premiums received, expected claims, expenses and persistency, which is the
measurement of the percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year, as measured by premiums. However, due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty
associated with the determination of the liabilities for unpaid policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle these liabilities. As a
result, we may experience volatility in the level of our reserves from period to period, particularly for our health and disability insurance products. To the extent that actual claims experience is
less favorable than our underlying assumptions, we could be required to increase our liabilities, which may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.

Our ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet our obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life.

We are an insurance holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Principal Life and other direct subsidiaries. Our
ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and any debt service, depends upon the receipt of dividends from Principal Life. Iowa
insurance laws impose limitations on the ability of Principal Life to pay dividends to us. Any inability of Principal Life to pay dividends to us in the future may cause us to be unable to pay
dividends to our stockholders and meet our other obligations. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


—
Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on Principal Life's ability to pay us dividends.

The pattern of amortizing our DPAC on our SFAS 97 products may change, impacting both the level of the asset and the timing of our operating earnings.

Amortization of the DPAC asset depends on the actual and expected profits generated by the lines of business that generated the expenses. Expected profits are
dependent on assumptions regarding a number of factors including investment returns, benefit payments, expenses, mortality, and policy lapse. Due to the uncertainty associated with establishing these
assumptions, we cannot, with precision, determine the exact pattern of profit emergence. As a result, amortization of DPAC will vary from period to period. To the extent that actual experience emerges
less favorably than expected, or our expectation for future profits decreases, the DPAC asset may be reduced, reducing our profitability in the current period.

We may need to fund deficiencies in our Closed Block.

In connection with its conversion in 1998 into a stock life insurance company, Principal Life established an accounting mechanism, known as a "Closed Block," for
the benefit of participating ordinary life insurance policies that had a dividend scale in force on July 1, 1998. Dividend scales are the actuarial formulas used by life insurance companies to
determine amounts payable as dividends on participating policies based on experience factors relating to, among other things, investment results, mortality, lapse rates, expenses, premium taxes and
policy loan interest and utilization rates. The Closed Block was designed to provide reasonable assurance to policyholders included in the Closed Block that, after the conversion, assets would be
available to maintain the aggregate dividend scales in effect for 1997 if the experience underlying such scales were to continue.

We
allocated assets to the Closed Block as of July 1, 1998 in an amount such that we expect their cash flows, together with anticipated revenues from the policies in the Closed
Block, to be sufficient to support the Closed Block business, including payment of claims, expenses, charges and taxes and to provide for the continuation of aggregate dividend scales in accordance
with the 1997 policy dividend scales if the experience underlying such scales continues, and to allow for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. We bear the costs of
expenses associated
with Closed Block policies and, accordingly, these costs were not funded as part of the assets allocated to the Closed Block. Any increase in such costs in the future will be borne by us. As of
December 31, 2005, Closed Block assets and liabilities were $4,815.0 million and $5,866.1 million, respectively.

We
will continue to pay guaranteed benefits under the policies included in the Closed Block, in accordance with their terms. The Closed Block assets, cash flows generated by the Closed
Block assets and anticipated revenues from polices included in the Closed Block may not be sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies. If they are not sufficient, we must
fund the shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose for business reasons to support dividend payments on policies in the Closed Block with our general account funds.

The
Closed Block assets, cash flows generated by the Closed Block assets and anticipated revenues from policies in the Closed Block will benefit only the holders of those policies. In
addition, to the extent that these amounts are greater than the amounts estimated at the time we funded the Closed Block, dividends payable in respect of the policies included in the Closed Block may
be greater than they would have been in the absence of a Closed Block. Any excess earnings will be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders but will not be available to our
stockholders.

Changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards may reduce our profitability.

Changes in regulation in the United States may reduce our profitability.

Our insurance business is subject to comprehensive state regulation and supervision throughout the U.S. The primary purpose of state regulation of the insurance
business is to protect policyholders, not stockholders. The laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers to regulate such matters as:

•

licensing
companies to transact business,

•

licensing
agents,

•

admitting
statutory assets,

•

mandating
a number of insurance benefits,

•

regulating
premium rates,

•

approving
policy forms,

•

regulating
unfair trade and claims practices,

•

establishing
statutory reserve requirements and solvency standards,


•

fixing
maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values,

•

restricting
various transactions between affiliates, and

•

regulating
the types, amounts and valuation of investments.

State
insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, and may impose changes in the future.

Federal
legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability. For
example, Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to permit application of state law remedies, such as
consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. Additionally, new interpretations of
existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously. In addition, reductions in contribution
levels to defined contribution plans may decrease our profitability.

Changes in federal taxation could reduce sales of our insurance, annuity and investment products.

Current federal income tax laws generally permit the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by the holders of annuities and life
insurance products. Taxes, if any, are payable on income attributable to a distribution under the contract for the year in which the distribution is made. Congress has, from time to time, considered
legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of such deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within life insurance and non-qualified annuity contracts. Enactment of this
legislation, including a simplified "flat tax" income structure with an exemption from taxation for investment income, could result in fewer sales of our insurance, annuity and investment products.

Repeal or modification of the federal estate tax could reduce our revenues.

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 amended the federal estate tax laws by increasing the amount of the unified credit beginning in
2002, thereby increasing the amount of property not subject to the estate tax. The Act also gradually reduces the federal estate tax rate over a period of years beginning in 2002, and repeals the tax
entirely in 2010. The law in effect prior to the Act, however, is reinstated for years after 2010. Through the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we received recurring premium of
$31.5 million for survivorship life insurance policies we have sold. A significant number of these policies were purchased for the purpose of providing cash to pay federal estate taxes. The
reduction of the federal estate tax and temporary repeal could result in policyholders reducing coverage under, or surrendering, these policies.

Changes in federal, state and foreign securities laws may reduce our profitability.

Our asset management and accumulation and life insurance businesses are subject to various levels of regulation under federal, state and foreign securities laws.
These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory or brokerage clients and generally grant supervisory agencies broad
administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. Changes to these laws or regulations that restrict the
conduct of our business could reduce our profitability.

Changes in accounting standards may reduce our profitability.

Accounting standards are subject to change and can negatively impact our profitability. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Recent Accounting Changes." The results for past accounting periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future accounting
period.

In
October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a working draft of SFAS No. 15X, "Fair Value Measurements", which will be effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2006. The purpose of this guidance is to establish a framework for measuring fair value that would
apply broadly to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. A move to fair value accounting may lead to more volatility in the income statement.

Several
years ago the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and the FASB launched a project to converge International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and
U.S. GAAP. Progress has been made in recent years by both Boards in reducing key differences between the two sets of standards. There are many differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS that
impact those using, preparing, auditing or regulating cross-border financial reporting. As the project to converge IFRS and U.S. GAAP continues, current GAAP fundamentals may be modified to
become consistent with IFRS, which may result in changes in the financial statements of U.S. companies.


Litigation and regulatory investigations may affect our financial strength or reduce our profitability.

We are a plaintiff or defendant in actions arising out of our insurance businesses and investment operations. We are, from time to time, also involved in various
governmental, regulatory and administrative proceedings and inquiries. These factors may affect our financial strength or reduce our profitability. For further discussion on litigation and regulatory
investigation risk, see Item 3, "Legal Proceedings."

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our profitability.

Principal International generally writes policies denominated in various local currencies and invests the premiums and deposits in local currencies. Although
investing in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of these results into our
consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on foreign currency exchange risk, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Foreign
Currency Risk."

Applicable laws and our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders
might consider in their best interests.

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent, or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our
stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a
bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as
discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

State
laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate
management entrenchment, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Under
the Iowa insurance laws, for a period of five years following the effective date of the demutualization, no person may acquire beneficial ownership of more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock without the prior approval of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa and our board of directors. The Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa and our
board of directors may consider the following factors:

•

the
effects of the action on our stockholders;

•

the
effects of the action on our employees, suppliers, creditors and customers;

•

the
effects of the action on the communities in which we operate;

•

our
long-term as well as short-term interests; and

•

the
long-term as well as short-term interests of our stockholders.

This
restriction does not apply to acquisitions made by us or made through an employee benefit plan or employee benefit trust sponsored by us.

The
following provisions, included in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover
attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:

•

permit
our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;

•

divide
our board of directors into three classes;

•

limit
the ability of stockholders to remove directors;

•

prohibit
stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors;

•

prohibit
stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;

•

impose
advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings; and

•

require
the approval by the holders of at least 75% of our outstanding common stock for the amendment of our by-laws and provisions of our certificate of
incorporation governing:

•

the
classified board,

•

the
director's discretion in determining what he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of Principal Financial Group, Inc.,

•

the
liability of directors, and

•

the
elimination of stockholder actions by written consent.


In
addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an "interested stockholder" to engage in business combinations with us.
An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.

Our
stockholder rights plan may have anti-takeover effects. The stockholder rights plan is designed to protect our stockholders in the event of unsolicited offers to acquire
us and other coercive takeover tactics, which, in the opinion of our board of directors, could impair the board's ability to represent stockholder interests. Our stockholder rights plan might render
an unsolicited takeover more difficult or less likely to occur, even though such a takeover might offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market
price and may be favored by our stockholders.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

We own 25 properties in our home office complex in Des Moines, Iowa and in various other locations. Of these 25 properties, 10 are office buildings, 2 are
warehouse facilities, 12 are parking lots and ramps, and 1 is a park/green space. Of the office and warehouse space, we occupy approximately 92% of the 2.85 million square feet of space in
these buildings. The balance of the space in these buildings is rented to commercial tenants. Of the parking properties there are approximately 5,234 stalls. We lease office space for various offices
located throughout the U.S. and internationally. We believe that our owned and leased properties are suitable and adequate for our current business operations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are regularly involved in litigation, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff but primarily as a defendant. Litigation naming us as a defendant ordinarily
arises out of our business operations as a provider of asset management and accumulation products and services, and life, health and disability insurance. Some of the lawsuits are class actions, or
purport to be, and some include claims for punitive damages. In addition, regulatory bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
the Department of Labor and others regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws, ERISA and
laws governing the activities of broker-dealers.

Several
lawsuits have been filed against other insurance companies and insurance brokers alleging improper conduct relating to the payment and non-disclosure of contingent
compensation and bid-rigging activity. Several of these suits were filed as purported class actions. Several state attorneys general and insurance regulators have initiated
industry-wide inquiries or other actions relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers and insurance companies and other industry issues. We received a subpoena on
March 3, 2005, from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York seeking information on compensation agreements associated with the sale of retirement products. On
January 13, 2006, we received a subpoena and a set of interrogatories from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut seeking information and documents relating to payment
of contingent compensation to brokers and actions in restraint of trade in the sale of group annuities. We are cooperating with these inquiries. We have received requests from regulators and other
governmental authorities relating to industry issues and may receive such requests in the future.

On
December 23, 2004, a lawsuit was filed in Iowa state court against us and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Principal Life and Principal Financial Services, Inc., on behalf
of a proposed class comprised of the settlement class in the Principal Life sales practices class action settlement, which was approved in April 2001 by the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Iowa. This more recent lawsuit claims that the treatment of the settlement costs of that sales practices litigation in relation to the allocation of demutualization consideration
to Principal Life policyholders was inappropriate. Demutualization allocation was done pursuant to the terms of a plan of demutualization approved by the policyholders in July 2001 and
Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa in August 2001. The lawsuit further claims that such allocation was not accurately described to policyholders during the
demutualization process and is a breach of the sales practices settlement. On January 27, 2005, we filed a notice to remove the action from state court to the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Iowa. On July 22, 2005, the plaintiff's motion to remand the action to state court was denied, and our motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted. On
September 21, 2005, the plaintiff's motion to alter or amend the judgment was denied. On October 4, 2005, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the United State Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit. A lawsuit was filed against us, Principal Life, and Principal Financial Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa on
October 31, 2005. The claims and allegations in the new lawsuit are substantially the same as those in the December 23, 2004 lawsuit, but the proposed class is limited to those members
of the settlement class in the Principal Life sales practices class action settlement who did not own annuities and who received demutualization consideration in the form of cash under the plan of
demutualization. We have filed a motion to dismiss all claims.


While the outcome of any pending or future litigation cannot be predicted, management does not believe that any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business or
financial position. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and unforeseen results can occur. It is possible that such outcomes could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or
annual period.

For
a discussion of items materially affecting the comparability of 2005, 2004, and 2003, please see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations — Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations."

Our
consolidated financial information for 2002 and 2001 was affected by the following transactions that affect year-to-year comparability:

•

On
February 1, 2002, we sold our remaining stake of 15.1 million shares of Coventry Health Care. We accounted for our investment in Coventry using the equity
method prior to its sale. Our share of Coventry's net income was $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.

•

On
October 1, 2001, Spectrum Asset Management ("Spectrum") became an affiliate of Principal Global Investors. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method and the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition. In October 2002, we purchased the remaining 20% of
Spectrum. We included revenues of $11.0 million, $5.9 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in our consolidated
results of operations.

•

On
September 25, 2001, we disposed of all the stock of PT Asuransi Jiwa Principal Indonesia, our subsidiary in Indonesia. We received nominal proceeds, which resulted
in a realized capital loss of $6.7 million in 2001. We included nominal revenues and net loss from our operations in Indonesia in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2001. We received an additional $1.4 million in 2003 pursuant to the 2001 sale agreement, resulting in a $0.9 million after-tax realized capital gain.

•

On
February 15, 2001, we disposed of all of the stock of Principal International España, S.A. de Seguros de Vida, our subsidiary in Spain, for nominal
proceeds, resulting in a realized capital loss of $38.4 million, or $21.0 million net of income tax, ceasing our business operations in Spain.

Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Discontinued Operations" for a description of our

See
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting
Policies" for a description of recent accounting changes.

(4)

On
June 16, 2005, we issued 13.0 million shares of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock under our shelf registration. We paid preferred stock dividends
of $9.4 million and $8.3 million on September 30, 2005, and December 31, 2005, respectively.

(5)

Earnings
per share information for 2001 represents unaudited pro forma earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2001. For purposes of calculating pro forma per
diluted share information, weighted-average shares outstanding were used. For the period January 1, 2001 through October 25, 2001, we estimated 360.8 million common shares were
outstanding. This consists of 260.8 million shares issued to eligible policyholders in our demutualization and the 100.0 million shares issued in our initial public offering ("IPO")
which closed on October 26, 2001. For the period October 26, 2001 through December 31, 2001, actual shares outstanding were used in the weighted-average share calculation.

(6)

During
2001, we issued 260.8 million shares of common stock as compensation in the demutualization, 100.0 million shares of common stock in our IPO and
15.0 million shares of common stock as a result of the exercise of over-allotment options granted to underwriters in the IPO. All shares issued have a $0.01 per share par value.

(7)

As
of December 31, 2001, represents: a) additional paid-in capital from the demutualization resulting from the reclassification of residual retained earnings
of Principal Mutual Holding Company, net of common stock issued ($5,047.7 million); b) net proceeds, net of common stock issued, from the sale of 100.0 million shares of common
stock in our IPO ($1,752.9 million); c) net proceeds, net of common stock issued, from the exercise of over-allotment options granted to underwriters in the IPO
($265.2 million); and d) common stock issued and held in a rabbi trust ($6.7 million).

(8)

As
of December 31, 2001, represents a $29.1 million net loss for the period October 26, 2001 through December 31, 2001. Retained earnings as of
October 26, 2001, were reclassified to additional paid-in capital as a result of our demutualization.


Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following analysis discusses our financial condition as of December 31, 2005, compared with December 31, 2004, and our consolidated results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance. The discussion should be read in conjunction
with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

(1) a decline or increased volatility in the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rates of investment, either of which could reduce our
net income, revenues and assets under management; (2) our investment portfolio is subject to several risks which may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our sales,
profitability and the investment returns credited to our customers; (3) competition from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and
stronger financial performance may impair our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability; (4) a downgrade in any of our ratings may increase
policy surrenders and withdrawals, reduce new sales and terminate relationships with distributors and cause some of our existing liabilities to be subject to acceleration, additional collateral
support, changes in terms, or creation of additional financial obligations; (5) our efforts to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our profitability and surplus may not be effective;
(6) if we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives and develop new distribution sources, sales of our products and services may be reduced; (7) our international businesses
face political, legal, operational and other risks that could reduce our profitability in those businesses; (8) our reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove
inadequate, requiring us to increase liabilities; (9) our ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet our obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws
impose on Principal Life Insurance Company ("Principal Life"); (10) the pattern of amortizing our deferred policy acquisition costs on our Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS")
No. 97

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments

Overview

We provide financial products and services through the following segments:

•

U.S.
Asset Management and Accumulation, which consists of our asset accumulation operations, which provide retirement savings and related investment products and services,
and our asset management operations conducted through Principal Global Investors. We provide a comprehensive portfolio of asset accumulation products and services to businesses and individuals in the
U.S., with a concentration on small and medium-sized businesses, which we define as businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees. We offer to businesses products and services for defined contribution
pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans, non-qualified executive benefit plans, and employee stock ownership plan consulting services. We also offer
annuities, mutual funds and bank products and services to the employees of our business customers and other individuals. Principal Global Investors offers an extensive range of equity, fixed income
and real estate investments as well as specialized overlay and advisory services to institutional investors.

•

International
Asset Management and Accumulation, which consists of Principal International, offers retirement products and services, annuities, long-term mutual
funds and life insurance through operations in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, India, and Malaysia.

•

Life
and Health Insurance, which provides individual life insurance, group health insurance as well as specialty benefits in the U.S. Our individual life insurance products
include universal and variable universal life insurance and traditional life insurance. Our health insurance products include group medical insurance and fee-for-service


claims
administration and wellness services. Our specialty benefit products include group dental and vision insurance, individual and group disability insurance, and group life insurance.

•

Corporate
and Other, which manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate and Other segment
primarily reflect our financing activities (including interest expense), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses
and other after-tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items.

Our
historical results contain a Mortgage Banking segment, which engaged in originating, purchasing, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans in the U.S. On July 1, 2004,
we closed the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. to CitiMortgage, Inc., described further in "Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations."

Economic Factors and Trends

Modest results in the equity markets along with an increase in net cash flow have led to increases in asset accumulation's account values and our asset
management's assets under management.

In
our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment, we continued to grow our existing business through organic growth in our existing subsidiaries and a combination of joint
ventures and strategic acquisitions.

Over
the past few years, we have shifted our marketing emphasis to universal and variable universal life insurance products from traditional life insurance products in our Life and
Health segment. We are also in the early stages of a trend toward voluntary products sponsored by employers.

Profitability

Our profitability depends in large part upon our:

•

amount
of assets under management;

•

spreads
we earn on our policyholders' general account asset accumulation business that result from the difference between what we earn and what we credit;

•

ability
to generate fee revenues by providing administrative and investment management services;

•

ability
to price our life and health insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and
administering those products, which is primarily a function of competitive conditions, persistency, our ability to assess and manage trends in mortality and morbidity experience, our ability to
generate investment earnings and our ability to maintain expenses in accordance with pricing assumptions;

•

ability
to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or impairments of invested assets;

•

ability
to effectively hedge fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates; and

•

ability
to manage our operating expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our accounting policies. Our
significant accounting policies are described in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 Nature of Operations and Significant
Accounting Policies". We have identified five critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our
critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates and
changes in guidance. The identification, selection and disclosure of critical accounting estimates and policies have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Valuation of Invested Assets

Fixed Maturities, Available-for-Sale.

Fixed maturity securities include
bonds, mortgage-backed securities and redeemable preferred stock. We classify our fixed maturity securities as either available-for-sale or trading and, accordingly, carry them
at fair value in the statement of financial position. The fair values of our public fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However,
23% of our invested asset portfolio is invested in fixed maturity securities that are private market assets, where there are no readily available market quotes to determine the fair market value.
These assets are valued using a spread pricing matrix. Securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by asset class, sector, rating, and average life. Each pricing category is assigned a
risk spread based on studies of observable public market data or market clearing data from the


investment
professionals assigned to specific security classes. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted back at the current Treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread.
Although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an individual security within each pricing category may actually be impacted by company
specific factors. Certain market events that could impact the valuation of securities include issuer credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation, and government actions among
others. An interest rate increase in the range of 20 to 100 basis points, while holding credit spreads constant, produces total values of $37.7 billion and $36.2 billion, as compared to
the recorded amount of $38.1 billion related to our fixed maturity, available-for-sale assets held by the Principal Life general account.

Investments
classified as available-for-sale are subject to impairment reviews. When evaluating a fixed maturity security for impairment, we consider relevant
facts and circumstances in evaluating whether the impairment is other than temporary. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has
been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events;
and (4) our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time that allows for the recovery of value which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. When it is determined that the
decline in value is other than temporary the carrying value of the security is reduced to its fair value, with a corresponding charge to net income. The corresponding charge is referred to as an
other-than-temporary impairment and is reported as a net realized/unrealized capital loss in our consolidated statement of operations.

There
are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks and
uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that
issuer; (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; (3) the risk that our investment professionals are
making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers; and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and
circumstances lead us to change our intent to hold the security until it recovers in value. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period. At December 31,
2005, we had $13,163.6 million in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with gross unrealized losses totaling $256.2 million. Included in the gross
unrealized losses are losses attributable to both movements in market interest rates as well as temporary credit issues. Net income would be reduced by approximately $166.5 million, on an
after-tax basis, if all the securities were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. In 2005, we recognized $48.7 million in after-tax gains on the sales of
impaired securities including a $33.9 million after-tax recovery received as the result of a litigation settlement. We also recognized an additional $3.3 million in
after-tax impairment losses on assets that had previously been impaired and an additional $1.2 million in after-tax losses on the sale of previously impaired securities.

Mortgage Loans.

Mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. At
December 31, 2005, commercial mortgage loans aggregated to $9,890.7 million. Commercial mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of
discounts, computed using the interest method, and net of valuation allowances. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, and reported
as mortgage loans in the statements of financial position.

Commercial
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we determine that a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the
estimated value. Estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or fair
value of the collateral. The change in valuation allowance is reported as a net realized/unrealized capital loss on our consolidated statements of operations.

The
determination of the calculation and the adequacy of the mortgage loan allowance and mortgage impairments are subjective. Our periodic evaluation and assessment of the adequacy of
the allowance for losses and the need for mortgage impairments is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated
value of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, loss experience and other relevant factors. The calculation for determining loan specific impairment
amounts is also subjective, as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Our financial position is sensitive to changes in estimated
cash flows from mortgages, the value of the collateral, and changes in the economic environment in general. The allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and
decrease when economic conditions improve.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs ("DPAC")

Commissions and other costs (underwriting, issuance and agency expenses) that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance
policies and investment contract business are capitalized to the extent recoverable. Maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to operations as incurred.


DPAC
of non-participating term life insurance policies are amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in
computing policyholder liabilities. Once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies, they will not be changed over the life of the policy. The DPAC for universal
life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and investment contracts are amortized over the expected lifetime of the policies in relation to the emergence of
estimated gross profits.

At
issue and each valuation date, we develop an estimate of the expected future gross profits. These estimated gross profits contain assumptions relating to mortality, morbidity,
investment yield and expenses. As actual experience emerges, the gross profits may vary from those expected either in magnitude or timing in which case a true-up to actual occurs as a
charge or credit to current operations. In addition, we are required to revise our assumptions regarding future experience as soon as the current assumptions are no longer actuarially credible. Both
actions, reflecting actual experience and changing future estimates, can change the amount of the asset and the pattern of future amortization.

For
individual variable annuities and group annuities which have separate account equity investment options, we utilize a mean reversion method (reversion to the mean assumption), a
common industry practice, to determine the future domestic equity market growth rate assumption used for the amortization of DPAC. This practice assumes that the expectation for long-term
appreciation is not changed by minor short-term market fluctuations.

DPAC
are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing at the end of each accounting period. If loss recognition is necessary, DPAC are
written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profits are not adequate to cover related losses and expenses.

The
total DPAC asset balance as of December 31, 2005, was $2.2 billion. The impact of a 1% reduction in the long-term investment performance rate assumption on
separate accounts in our DPAC models is an estimated $9.6 million reduction in the DPAC asset as of December 31, 2005. Also, removing the mean reversion methodology from the DPAC asset
calculation would reduce the December 31, 2005 DPAC balance by $2.8 million.

Insurance Reserves

Reserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due, at some point in the future, to our contractholders. U.S. GAAP, allowing for
some degree of managerial judgment, prescribes the methods of establishing reserves.

Future
policy benefits and claims include reserves for traditional and group life insurance, accident and health insurance, and individual and group annuities that provide periodic
income payments, which are computed using assumptions of mortality, morbidity, lapse, investment performance and expense. These assumptions are based on our experience and are periodically reviewed
against industry standards to ensure actuarial credibility. For long duration insurance contracts, once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies, they will not be changed
over the life of the policy. However, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves.
Premium deficiency reserves may also be established for short duration contracts to provide for expected future losses. Our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis
including, among other things, experience studies, claim development analysis and annual statutory asset adequacy analysis. To the extent experience indicates potential loss recognition, we recognize
losses on certain lines of business. The ultimate accuracy of the assumptions on these long-tailed insurance products cannot be determined until the obligation of the entire block of
business on which the assumptions were made is extinguished. Short-term variances of actual results from the assumptions used in the computation of the reserves are reflected in current
period net income and can impact quarter-to-quarter net income.

Future
policy benefits and claims also include reserves for incurred but unreported health claims. We recognize claims costs in the period the service was provided to our members.
However, claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive, process and pay the claims. We determine the amount of this liability using actuarial methods
based on historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to determine our estimate of claim liabilities. We also look back to assess how our prior periods' estimates
developed. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claim expense. For the years ending 2005, 2004 and 2003, the amount of the claim reserve
adjustment made in that period for prior period estimates was within a reasonable range given our normal claim fluctuations.

Benefit Plans

The reported expense and liability associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans requires the use of assumptions. Numerous assumptions are made
regarding the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, turnover, expected compensation increases, health care claim costs, health care cost trends, retirement
rates, and mortality. The discount rate and the expected return on plan assets have the most significant impact on the level of cost.

The
assumed discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments and discounting those cash flows using rates based on the Bloomberg AA Finance yield to maturity curves. For
2005 year-end, we set the discount rate at 5.75%. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase pension benefits Projected Benefit Obligation ("PBO") and


the
2006 Net Periodic Pension Cost ("NPPC") by approximately $59.2 million and $10.9 million, respectively. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase other
post-retirement benefits Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation ("APBO") and the 2006 Net Periodic Benefit Cost ("NPBC") by approximately $10.0 million and
$0.5 million, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would result in decreases in benefit obligations and expenses at a level generally commensurate with that noted above.

The
assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is set at the long-term rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the
plans and the various classes of the invested funds. Historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes were analyzed to develop a
risk-free real rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class. The overall long-term rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term
inflation component, the risk free real rate of return, and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on long-term returns for each asset class, the plan's
target asset allocation policy, and the tax structure of the trusts. For the 2005 NPPC and 2005 NPBC, an 8.5% and 7.3% weighted average long-term rate of return was used, respectively. For
the 2006 NPPC and 2006 NPBC, an 8.25% and 7.3% weighted average long-term rate of return assumption will be used, respectively. A 0.25% decrease in the long-term rate of return
would increase 2006 NPPC by approximately $3.2 million and the 2006 NPBC by approximately $1.1 million. A 0.25% increase in this rate would result in a decrease to expense at the same
levels. The expected return on plan assets is based on the fair market value of plan assets as of September 30, 2005.

The
compensation increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation.

Actuarial
gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of employees, which is approximately
9 years for pension costs and approximately 13 years for other postretirement benefit costs.

Prior
service costs are amortized on a weighted average basis over approximately 8 years for both pension and other postretirement benefit costs.

Income Taxes

We
provide for income taxes based on our estimate of the liability for taxes due. Our tax accounting represents management's best estimate of various events and transactions, such as
completion of tax audits, which could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate in a particular quarter or annual period.

Inherent
in the provision for income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items, the timing of income and expense recognition and the realization of certain tax
credits. In the event our estimates of the ultimate deductibility of certain items, the timing of the recognition of income and expense or the realization of certain tax credits differ from prior
estimates due to the receipt of new information, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Any such change could
significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these estimates change.

In
addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits in various jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized for book purposes when the probable threshold is met with regard
to the validity of the tax position. Once this threshold is met, for each tax reporting issue, we provide for our best estimate of the payments to be made to or received from the Internal Revenue
Service and other taxing authorities for audits ongoing or not yet commenced. We believe that we have adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final
resolution of contested issues could take several years while legal remedies are pursued. Consequently, we do not anticipate the ultimate resolution of audits ongoing or not yet commenced to have a
material impact on our net income.

Principal International Argentina S.A.

On July 2, 2004, we closed the sale of PI Argentina,
our subsidiary in Argentina, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Principal Life Compañía de Seguros, S.A. and Principal Retiro Compañía de
Seguros de Retiro, S.A. Our total after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately U.S. $29.2 million.

The
decision to sell PI Argentina was made with a view toward focusing our resources, executing in core strategic priorities and markets and meeting stockholders expectations. Changing
market dynamics since the 2001 economic crisis in Argentina led us to conclude that the interests of Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s stockholders would best be served by our exit of this
market.

PI
Argentina qualifies for discontinued operations treatment under SFAS 144, therefore, the results of operations have been removed from our results of continuing operations and
segment operating earnings for all periods presented. All assets, including cash, and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been reclassified to separate discontinued asset and liability
line items on the consolidated statements of financial position. We have separately disclosed the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued
operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

operations data to present subsequent to the date of the sale.

Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc.

On July 1, 2004, we closed the sale of Principal
Residential Mortgage, Inc. to CitiMortgage, Inc. Our total after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately $620.0 million. Our Mortgage Banking segment, which
includes Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., is accounted for as a discontinued operation, under SFAS 144 and therefore, the results of operations (excluding corporate overhead) have
been removed from our results of continuing operations and segment operating earnings for all periods presented. All assets, including cash, and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been
reclassified to separate discontinued asset and liability line items on the consolidated statements of financial position. We have separately disclosed the operating, investing and financing portions
of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Corporate overhead allocated to our Mortgage Banking segment does not
qualify for discontinued operations treatment under SFAS 144 and is included in our results of continuing operations and segment operating earnings for all periods prior to July 1, 2004.

The
decision to sell Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. was made with a view toward intensifying our strategic focus on our core retirement and risk protection business as well
as achieving our longer-term financial objectives. In addition, the sale was also viewed as a positive move for our stockholders as we go forward from an improved capital position, with
better financial flexibility and greater stability of earnings.

The
2004 summary results of operations information is for the six months ended prior to the July 1, 2004, sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. and, accordingly,
there is no statement of operations data to present subsequent to the date of the sale.

Our
U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment held residential mortgage banking escrow deposits (reported as other liabilities) as of December 31, 2003. The purchaser (or
acquirer) closed out the banking escrow deposit accounts as a result of the sale. U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation total revenues from this arrangement reclassified to discontinued operations
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $(5.6) million and $28.6 million, respectively. Income (loss) from discontinued operations net of related income taxes, for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, were $(3.5) million and $11.2 million, respectively.

BT Financial Group.

On October 31, 2002, we sold substantially all of BT Financial Group to
Westpac Banking Corporation ("Westpac"). As of December 31, 2005, we have received proceeds of A$958.9 million Australian dollars ("A$") (U.S. $537.4 million) from Westpac. Our
total after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately U.S. $900.0 million. This amount includes cash proceeds from Westpac, tax benefits and a gain from unwinding the
hedged asset associated with our investment in BT Financial Group.

The
decision to sell BT Financial Group was made with a view toward focusing our resources, executing on core strategic priorities and meeting stockholder expectations. Changing market
dynamics since our acquisition of BT Financial Group, including industry consolidation, led us to conclude that the interests of BT Financial Group clients and staff would be best served under
Westpac's ownership.

Refinements
to the estimated loss, reported as discontinued operations, resulted in an increase to net income of $8.4 million and $21.8 million in 2005 and 2003,
respectively.

Fluctuations in Foreign Currency to U.S. Dollar Exchange Rates

Fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for countries in which we have operations can affect reported financial results. In years when
foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in fewer U.S. dollars to be reported. When foreign currencies strengthen, translating
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in more U.S. dollars to be reported.

Foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations create variances in our financial statement line items but have not had a material impact on our consolidated income from continuing
operations. Our consolidated income from continuing
operations was positively impacted $7.1 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and negatively impacted $5.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. For a discussion of our approaches to foreign currency exchange rate risk, see Item
7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk."

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Expense

The 2005 annual pension benefit expense for substantially all of our employees and certain agents was $48.6 million pre-tax, which was an
$8.8 million increase from the 2004 pre-tax pension expense of $39.8 million. Of the $39.8 million of 2004 pre-tax expense, $51.8 million of expense
ran through operating earnings and $12.1 million in pre-tax gains ran through discontinued operations due to the mid-year remeasurement for the Principal Residential
Mortgage, Inc. divestiture. The discount rate used to determine the 2005 expense was 6.0%, which is down from the 6.25% and 6.5% discount rates used to calculate the 2004 expense. Two discount
rates were used in 2004 due to the mid-year


remeasurement
for the Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. divestiture. The expected long-term return on assets assumption used for the 2005 pension expense remained at 8.5%.

Effective
January 1, 2006, we are making changes to our retirement program, including the Principal Select Savings Plan ("401(k) Plan") and the Principal Pension Plan ("Pension
Plan") and the corresponding nonqualified plans. The qualified and nonqualified Pension Plan changes include a reduction to the traditional and cash balance formulas, a change in the early retirement
factors, and the removal of the cost of living adjustments for traditional benefits earned after January 1, 2006. The qualified and nonqualified 401(k) Plan company match is increasing from
50 percent of a 6 percent deferral to 75 percent of an 8 percent deferral. The Pension Plan changes will reduce the Pension Plan expense in 2006, while the 401(k) changes
will increase the 401(k) expense.

The
2006 pension expense for substantially all of our employees and certain agents is expected to be approximately $34.6 million. This is a decrease of $14.0 million over
the 2005 pension expense. This decrease is due to the reduction in the Pension Plan formulas and asset performance in excess of our 8.5% long-term assumption. Partially offsetting this was
an increase attributable to the use of a lower discount rate and lower long-term asset return assumption. The discount rate used to develop the 2006 expense was lowered to 5.75%, down from
the 6.0% discount rate used to develop the 2005 expense. The long-term asset assumption was also lowered to 8.25%, down from the 8.50% assumption used to develop the 2005 expense. The 2006
decrease in pension expense is expected to be offset by a $14.2 million increase in 401(k) Plan company matching expense resulting from the January 1, 2006, 401(k) Plan changes.

Recent Accounting Changes

On September 19, 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee ("AcSEC") issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises
for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts

. AcSEC defines
an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a
contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. An internal replacement that is determined to result in a replacement contract that is substantially unchanged from the
replaced contract should be accounted for as a continuation of the replaced contract. Contract modifications resulting in a replacement contract that is substantially changed from the replaced
contract should be accounted for as an
extinguishment of the replaced contract and any unamortized deferred acquisition costs, unearned revenue liabilities, and deferred sales inducement assets from the replaced contract should be written
off and acquisition costs on the new contracts capitalized as appropriate. This SOP is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are
still evaluating the impact this guidance will have to our consolidated financial statements.

On
May 30, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement
of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3

("SFAS 154"), which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting
principle. Under SFAS 154, a change in accounting principle should be retrospectively applied to all prior periods, unless it is impracticable to do so. This retrospective application
requirement replaces the Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

("APB 20"), requirement to recognize changes in
accounting principle by including the cumulative effect of the change in net income during the current period. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles where we are
changing to a more preferable accounting method, as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not contain specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 carries forward
without change the guidance contained in APB 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes on or after January 1, 2006. SFAS 154 does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements.

On
December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earning
Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 20

04 ("FSP 109-2"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was enacted on
October 22, 2004, and introduces, among other things, a special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer
("repatriation provision"), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109-2 was issued to allow additional time for companies to determine whether any foreign earnings will be repatriated
under the Act's repatriation provision, given the law was enacted late in the year and certain provisions were unclear. Under FSP 109-2, companies that took the additional time were
required to provide disclosures about the status of the company's evaluation and the potential effects of its decision. FSP 109-2 was effective for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Our current tax accrual reflects application of the provisions of the Act.

On
December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, ("SFAS 123R").
SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements. SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

("SFAS 123"), supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees

("APB 25"), and SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure — an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

and amends FASB Statement No. 95,

Statement of Cash
Flows

. On April 14, 2005, the SEC approved a new rule delaying the effective date of SFAS 123R to annual periods that begin after June 15, 2005.
Accordingly, we will be adopting SFAS 123R effective


January 1,
2006 using the modified prospective method. This Statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we began expensing all stock options using a
fair-value based method effective for the year beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, any stock options granted prior to January 1, 2002 are fully vested. We applied the
prospective method of transition as prescribed by SFAS 123 when we elected to begin expensing stock-based compensation in 2002.

In
May 2005, we learned of discussions between several major accounting firms, the FASB and the SEC concluding it is appropriate to recognize compensation cost either immediately
for stock awards granted to retirement eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if retirement eligibility is expected to occur during
the nominal vesting period. Our approach has been to follow the widespread practice of recognizing compensation cost over the explicit service period (up to the date of actual retirement). For any
awards that are granted after we adopt SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, we will recognize compensation cost through the period that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no
longer required to provide service to
earn the award. If we had applied the nonsubstantive vesting provisions of SFAS 123R to awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, our consolidated financial statements would not have been
materially impacted.

In
December 2004, SFAS No. 153,

Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

("SFAS 153"), was issued. APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

("APB 29"), provides the basic principle that
exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. However, APB 29 provided an exception that allowed certain exchanges of similar productive assets to
be recorded at book value. SFAS 153 amends APB 29 to eliminate this exception and requires non-monetary exchanges that meet certain criteria to be accounted for at fair
value. We adopted SFAS 153 and are applying its guidelines to nonmonetary exchanges occurring on or after July 1, 2005.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Premiums and other considerations increased $265.0 million, or 7%, to $3,975.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from
$3,710.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $170.5 million increase from the Life and Health Insurance segment, primarily related to
strong sales and stable persistency in our specialty benefits business and higher premium per member in our health insurance business partially


offset
by a decline in premiums resulting from the continuation of a shift in marketing emphasis from individual traditional life insurance products to individual universal and variable universal life
insurance products. The increase also reflected an $85.1 million increase from the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment, primarily a result of an increase in premiums from single
premium group annuities with life contingencies, which are typically used to fund defined benefit pension plan terminations. The premium income we receive from these contracts fluctuates due to the
variability in the number and size of pension plan terminations in the market, the interest rate environment and our ability to attract new sales.

Fees
and other revenues increased $211.2 million, or 14%, to $1,683.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $1,472.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $179.2 million increase from the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment primarily related to an increase in account values
and assets under management, modest performance in the equity markets and our acquisitions of Principal Services Trust Company and Columbus Circle.

Net
investment income increased $136.7 million, or 4%, to $3,360.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $3,224.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily related to a $2,393.8 million, or 4%, increase in average invested assets and cash. The yield on average invested assets and cash was 5.8%
for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Net
realized/unrealized capital losses decreased $93.6 million, or 89%, to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $104.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is due to fewer other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities ($90.2 million) including a $52.1 million recovery of
previously impaired securities received as the result of a litigation settlement, fewer losses related to the mark to market of derivative activities ($56.8 million), and gains versus losses on
mortgage loans and real estate ($24.5 million) offset in part by fewer mark to market gains on certain seed money investments ($30.4 million), fewer gains on the sales of other fixed
maturity securities ($13.9 million), more credit losses related to the sales of fixed maturity securities ($23.3 million), and the impairment of an equity partnership interest
($14.4 million).

Impairments
include $28.6 million of impairment write-downs and $74.0 million in realized recoveries on the sale of previously impaired assets. Credit losses include
$2.0 million in realized gains and $30.8 million in realized losses related to credit triggered sales. Other gains (losses) includes gross realized gains of $39.5 million and
gross realized losses of $31.3 million. Included in the $31.3 million of losses is an $11.0 million loss related to a large investment that was called from us in September.

(2)

Impairments
include $3.0 million of impairment write-downs. Other gains (losses) includes gross realized gains of $15.7 million and gross realized losses of

(3)

Impairments
include $6.3 million in realized losses due to the sale of commercial mortgage loans and a $7.6 million decrease in the commercial mortgage valuation
allowance.

(4)

Impairments
include $14.4 million in realized losses related to an equity partnership interest. Other gains (losses) include $11.8 million in mark to market of net
realized/unrealized gains on certain seed money investments.

Benefits,
claims and settlement expenses increased $323.4 million, or 7%, to $5,282.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $4,959.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $165.6 million increase from the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment, primarily reflecting the increase
in reserves resulting from an increase in sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies and an increase in interest credited on our investment only block of business stemming from an
increase in account values. The increase also reflected a $105.5 million increase from the Life and Health Insurance segment, primarily due to increased claim costs per medical member, an
increase in medical members, and growth in the specialty benefits business.


Dividends
to policyholders decreased $3.7 million, or 1%, to $293.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $296.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.3 million decrease from the Life and Health Insurance segment, resulting from a declining interest rate environment.

Operating
expenses increased $141.6 million, or 7%, to $2,307.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,165.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase reflected a $145.5 million increase from the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment, primarily due to growth in our asset management
business, an increase in compensation costs and due to our acquisitions of Principal Services Trust Company and Columbus Circle.

Income
taxes increased $54.2 million, or 30%, to $232.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $178.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The effective income tax rate was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2005, and 20% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The effective income tax rates for the
year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, were lower than the corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received, tax credits on our
investment in a synthetic fuel production facility, and interest exclusion from taxable income.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of income from discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting change, net of related income taxes, net income
increased $93.4 million, or 11%, to $919.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $825.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The income from
discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, was related to gains on the sales and operating revenues of real estate properties that qualify for discontinued operations
treatment under SFAS 144 and refinements to the estimated loss on the disposal of BT Financial Group partially offset by the negative impact of a change in the
estimated gain from the discontinued operations for Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. The income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, was related to our
sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., the sale of our Argentine companies, and operating revenues of real estate properties that qualify for discontinued operations treatment under
SFAS 144. The cumulative effect of accounting change was related to our implementation of SOP 03-1,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for
Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts

("SOP 03-1") in 2004.

Preferred
stock dividends were $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, with no corresponding activity for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net
income available to common stockholders increased $75.7 million, or 9%, to $901.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $825.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Premiums and other considerations increased $79.3 million, or 2%, to $3,710.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
$3,630.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase reflected a $77.6 million increase from the Life and Health segment primarily due to strong sales and favorable
retention in our specialty benefits business and health insurance rate increases partially offset by a decline in premiums resulting from a shift in marketing emphasis from individual traditional life
insurance products to individual universal and variable universal life insurance products.

Fees
and other revenues increased $286.2 million, or 24%, to $1,472.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $1,185.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation fees and other revenues increased $185.5 million primarily related to an increase in fees from our separate accounts and due to
improvements in the equity markets and net cash flow, which have led to higher account values. In addition, Life and Health Insurance fees and other revenues increased $83.0 million primarily
due to growth in the individual universal and variable universal life insurance business and the acquisition of the Molloy Companies effective January 2, 2004.

Net
investment income decreased $5.4 million to $3,224.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $3,229.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in annualized investment yields. The yield on average invested assets and cash was 5.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2004, compared to 6.2% for the year ended December 31, 2003. This reflects lower yields on invested assets due in part to a lower interest rate environment. Partially
offsetting the decrease was a $4,088.7 million, or 8% increase in average invested assets and cash.

Net
realized/unrealized capital losses increased $41.6 million, or 66%, to $104.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $63.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net realized losses was primarily due to higher mark to market losses related to hedging activities ($75.9 million), fewer mark to market
gains on certain seed money investments ($38.3 million), and the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses ($38.1 million) offset by fewer other than temporary declines in
the value of certain fixed maturity securities ($108.1 million).

Impairments
include $60.6 million of impairment losses and $15.8 million in recoveries on the sale of previously impaired assets. Credit losses include
$13.4 million in gains and $18.9 million in losses related to credit triggered sales. Other net realized gains (losses) includes gross realized gains of $31.2 million and gross
realized losses of $9.1 million.

Impairments
include $8.1 million of impairment losses. Other net realized gains (losses) includes gross realized gains of $21.5 million and gross realized losses of
$3.9 million.

Impairments
include $22.4 million in realized losses due to sale, foreclosure, or direct write-down of mortgage loans, a $2.1 million recovery on a
previously impaired commercial mortgage, a $6.9 million decrease in loan specific reserves, and a $1.3 million decrease in the general commercial mortgage valuation allowance.

(4)

Other
net realized gains (losses) includes $42.3 million in mark to market and realized gains on seed money.

Benefits,
claims and settlement expenses increased $103.7 million, or 2%, to $4,959.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $4,855.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to a $93.7 million increase from the International Asset Management and Accumulation segment, primarily due to an
increase in Chile related to higher reserve expenses due to the strengthening of the Chilean peso versus the U.S. dollar and higher sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies in 2004
following a year of decreased sales due to market contraction.

Dividends
to policyholders decreased $11.2 million, or 4%, to $296.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $307.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The decrease was due to a $9.2 million decrease from the Life and Health Insurance segment, resulting from changes in the individual life insurance dividend scale and
a decrease in the individual life insurance dividend interest crediting rates due to a declining interest rate environment.

Operating
expenses increased $167.2 million, or 8%, to $2,165.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $1,998.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to a $98.4 million increase from the Life and Health Insurance segment primarily resulting from the acquisition of the Molloy Companies
in 2004, increased DPAC amortization, and growth in our specialty benefits business. The increase also reflected a $68.5 million increase from the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation
segment, primarily reflecting an increase in amortization of DPAC in 2004 and an increase in non-deferrable expenses.

Income
taxes increased $2.6 million, or 1%, to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $175.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. The effective income tax rate was 20% for the year ended December 31, 2004, and 21% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective income tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was lower than the corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received, 2004 tax credits on our investment in a
synthetic fuel production facility, and interest exclusion from taxable income. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was lower than the corporate income tax rate
of 35% primarily due to income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received and a favorable settlement of an IRS audit issue.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of income from discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of related income taxes, net income
increased $79.3 million, or 11% to $825.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $746.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The income from
discontinued operations was related to our sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., our Argentine companies, certain real estate properties previously held for investment purposes and a
change in the estimated loss on disposal of BT Financial Group in 2003. The cumulative effect of accounting changes were related to our implementation of SOP 03-1 in 2004 and our
implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

("FIN 46") in 2003.


Results of Operations by Segment

We use segment operating earnings, which exclude the effect of net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax
adjustments, for goal setting, determining employee compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts. Segment operating earnings are determined by
adjusting U.S. GAAP net income available to common stockholders for net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments we believe are not
indicative of overall operating trends. Note that after-tax adjustments have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant
components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, we believe the presentation of segment operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by
highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of our businesses.

(5)

U.S.
Asset Management and Accumulation separate account assets include shares of the Principal Financial Group stock allocated to a separate account, a result of our demutualization.
The value of the separate account was $726.6 million, $782.8 million, and $833.9 million at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Changes in the fair value of
the separate account are reflected in both separate account assets and separate account liabilities.

(6)

Includes
inter-segment elimination amounts related to an internal line of credit, internally generated mortgage loans, and long-term borrowings. The Corporate and Other
segment managed a revolving line of credit used by other segments. The U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment and Life and Health Insurance segment reported mortgage loan assets issued for
real estate joint ventures. These mortgage loans were reported as liabilities in the Corporate and Other segment. In prior years, the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment had provided a
source of funding for the Mortgage Banking segment's mortgage servicing rights.

U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation Segment

Asset Accumulation Trends

Our sales of pension, institutional and other asset accumulation products and services in the U.S. have been affected by overall trends in the U.S. retirement
services industry, as our customers rely less on defined benefit retirement plans, social security and other government programs. Continuing trends in the work environment include a more mobile
workforce and the desire of employers to shift the market risk of retirement investments to employees by offering defined


contribution
plans rather than defined benefit plans. The graying of the population and recent market volatility are also driving growing interest in products generating stable income during
retirement. These trends are increasing the demand for defined contribution pension arrangements such as 401(k) plans, mutual funds, annuities and bank IRAs. The "baby-boom" generation of
U.S. workers has reached an age at which saving for retirement is critical and it continues to seek increased retirement savings using additional tax-advantaged investment products for
retirement. Considering these trends, asset accumulation account values increased as of December 31, 2005, primarily due to significant additional gross new deposits, solid performance of the
equity markets and retention of assets from existing clients. The interest rate environment remained relatively low despite an increase in interest rates that was more pronounced at the shorter
durations. The S&P 500 posted a 4.9% total return contributing to a strong increase in total account values and assets under management by the end of 2005.

Asset Management Trends

Asset management services have been among the most profitable and rapidly growing sectors of the financial services industry, at both the retail and institutional
level. We seek to take advantage of current trends, which indicate that both retail and institutional investors embrace specialization, providing increased fees to successful active managers with
expertise in specialty and niche areas. We have experienced very good success in winning institutional asset management mandates and expect to see continued growth in this area. Our U.S. third-party
assets under management increased $11.7 billion during 2005.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Premiums and other considerations increased $85.1 million, or 23%, to $455.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from
$370.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase primarily resulted from a $61.2 million increase in full-service payout sales of single premium group
annuities with life contingencies, which are typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations. The premium income received from these contracts
fluctuates due to the variability in the number and size of pension plan terminations, the interest rate environment and the ability to attract new sales. In addition, individual fixed annuity
premiums and other considerations increased $23.9 million due to increased sales from certain distribution channels and due to higher sales of larger sized contracts in 2005.

Fees
and other revenues increased $180.1 million, or 18%, to $1,196.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $1,016.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. Full-service accumulation fees and other revenues increased $104.0 million primarily due to continued strong net cash flow, modest performance in the
equity markets and our acquisition of Principal Services Trust Company. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $69.4 million increase in Principal Global Investors fees and other
revenues, which was primarily due to our acquisition of Columbus Circle, higher real estate transaction fees, an increase in assets under management and an increase in loans securitized in 2005.

Net
investment income increased $92.1 million, or 4%, to $2,447.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,355.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase reflects a $1,749.6 million, or 4%, increase in average invested assets and cash for the segment. The average annualized yield on invested assets and cash
was 5.7% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Benefits,
claims and settlement expenses, including dividends to policyholders, increased $165.5 million, or 8%, to $2,265.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2005, from $2,099.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase primarily resulted from a $73.4 million increase in our full-service payout business as
a result of increased sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies. Also contributing to the increase was a $68.5 million increase in investment-only business due
primarily to an increase in interest credited on this block of business stemming from higher account values. Partially offsetting the overall increase was a $32.3 million decrease in
full-service accumulation benefits, claims and settlement expenses primarily due to lower interest credited on our non-participating deposit type business and to a lesser
extent decreases in cost of interest credited on our participating block.

Operating
expenses increased $138.8 million, or 14%, to $1,133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $994.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase primarily resulted from a $77.0 million increase


in
full-service accumulation operating expenses due to our acquisition of Principal Services Trust Company, an increase in compensation costs and an increase in amortization of DPAC in
2005. In addition, Principal Global Investors operating expenses increased $46.1 million primarily due to our acquisition of Columbus Circle, growth in existing operations and an increase in
allocated expenses.

Income
taxes increased $13.6 million, or 9%, to $162.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $148.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The effective income tax rate for this segment was 23% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The effective income tax rates for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, were lower than the corporate income tax rate of 35%, as a result of income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received and interest exclusion from
taxable income.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, operating earnings increased $39.4 million, or 8%, to $538.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from
$499.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net
realized/unrealized capital losses, as adjusted, decreased $84.3 million, or 87%, to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from
$97.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is due to fewer other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities including a $24.3 million recovery
of previously impaired securities received as the result of a litigation settlement, fewer losses related to the mark to market of derivative activities, and gains versus losses on mortgage loans
offset in part by losses versus gains on the sale of fixed maturity securities.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of other after-tax adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005, net income available to common stockholders
increased $128.7 million, or 32%, to $525.6 million from $396.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net income
available to common stockholders included the negative effect of other after-tax adjustments totaling $5.0 million related to: (1) a loss from discontinued operations
associated with the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. ($3.5 million) and (2) a cumulative effect of accounting change due to our implementation of SOP 03-1
($1.5 million).

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Premiums and other considerations decreased $49.9 million, or 12%, to $370.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
$420.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from a $45.4 million decrease in full-service payout sales of single premium group
annuities with life contingencies, which are typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations. The premium income received from these contracts fluctuates due to the variability in the number
and size of pension plan terminations, the interest rate environment and the ability to attract new sales.

Fees
and other revenues increased $182.5 million, or 22%, to $1,016.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $833.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Full-service accumulation fees and other revenue increased $132.4 million primarily due to an increase in fees from our separate accounts resulting from
improvements in the equity markets and net cash flow, which have led to higher account values. Principal Global Investors fees and other revenues increased $34.0 million primarily due to
increased revenue from commercial real estate business and an increase in assets under management, which resulted from improvements in the equity markets and net cash flow.

Net
investment income decreased $13.1 million, or 1%, to $2,355.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $2,368.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The decrease reflects a decrease in the average annualized yield on invested assets and cash, which was 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to 6.2% for
the year ended December 31, 2003. This reflects lower yields on fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages due in part to a lower interest rate environment. The decrease in net
investment income due to a lower yield was partially offset by a $3,085.9 million, or 8%, increase in average invested assets and cash for the segment.

Benefits,
claims and settlement expenses, including dividends to policyholders, decreased $46.8 million, or 2%, to $2,099.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2004, from $2,146.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from a $43.1 million decrease in our full-service payout business as
a result of decreased sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies. Also contributing to the decrease was a $37.9 million decrease in full-service accumulation
business due primarily to a decrease in cost of interest credited on our non-participating deposit type business and to a lesser extent decreases in cost of interest credited on our
participating block. Partially offsetting the overall decrease was an increase of $28.0 million in our investment-only business primarily due to an increase in cost of interest
credited on this block of business as a result of an increase in account values.

Operating
expenses increased $71.1 million, or 8%, to $994.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $923.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase primarily resulted from a $57.8 million increase in our full-service accumulation operating expenses due to an increase in amortization of
DPAC in 2004 and an increase in non-deferrable expenses. In addition, individual fixed annuity operating expenses increased $16.4 million due to strong growth in our block of fixed
deferred annuity business.

Income
taxes increased $18.8 million, or 14%, to $148.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $129.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The effective income tax rate for this segment was 23% for the


years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, were lower than the corporate income tax rate of 35%, as a result
of income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received and interest exclusion from taxable income.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, operating earnings increased $76.4 million, or 18%, to $499.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
$422.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Net
realized/unrealized capital losses, as adjusted, increased $15.0 million, or 18%, to $97.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
$82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net realized losses was primarily due to higher mark to market losses related to hedging activities, higher commercial
mortgage loan losses and higher losses on the sale of real estate offset by fewer other than temporary declines in the value of certain fixed maturity securities and fewer losses related to credit
loss sales of securities.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of other after-tax adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004, net income increased $46.9 million,
or 13%, to $396.9 million from $350.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net income included the negative effect of other
after-tax adjustments totaling $5.0 million related to: (1) a loss from discontinued operations associated with the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc.
($3.5 million) and (2) a cumulative effect of accounting change due to our implementation of SOP 03-1 ($1.5 million). For the year ended December 31, 2003, net
income included the positive effect of other after-tax adjustments totaling $9.5 million related to: (1) the positive effect of income from discontinued operations associated
with the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. ($11.2 million) and (2) the negative effect of a cumulative effect of accounting change due to our implementation of FIN 46
($1.7 million).

International Asset Management and Accumulation Segment

Asset Accumulation Trends

Our international asset management and accumulation businesses focus on countries with a trend toward private sector defined contribution pension systems,
including privatization of public retirement pension systems. With
variations depending upon the specific country, we have targeted these markets for sales of retirement and related products and services, including defined contribution pension plans, annuities and
long-term mutual funds to businesses and individuals. In some of our international markets, we complement our sales of these products with sales of life insurance products.

We
have pursued our international strategy through a combination of start-ups, acquisitions and joint ventures, which require infusions of capital consistent with our
strategy of long-term growth and profitability.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Premiums and other considerations increased $6.6 million, or 3%, to $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from
$241.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. An increase of $18.4 million in Chile and Mexico was the result of the strengthening of the peso versus the U.S. dollar.
Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $10.6 million in Chile due to decreased sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies.

Fees
and other revenues increased $23.3 million, or 27%, to $109.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $85.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. An increase of $15.3 million in Mexico was primarily due to a refinement of accrued fee income, improved net transfers of pension customers from competitors, and the
strengthening of the peso versus the U.S. dollar. An increase of $3.4 million in India was a result of an increase in fees from PPIAC that began operations in February 2005 and an
increase in fees from growth in assets under
management. In addition, an increase of $3.3 million in Chile was primarily a result of an increase in mortgage loan servicing revenue, increased fees caused by growth in assets under
management and the strengthening of the peso.

Net
investment income increased $56.2 million, or 29%, to $247.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $191.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $473.5 million, or 22%, in average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity investments in subsidiaries. In
addition, the increase was related to an increase in the annualized yield on average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity investments in subsidiaries, which was 8.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2005, compared to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004.


Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $52.0 million, or 15%, to $409.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $357.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. An increase of $54.5 million in Chile was the result of the strengthening of the peso versus the U.S. dollar and higher interest credited to customers
partially offset by a lower change in reserves due to a decrease in sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies in 2005.

Operating
expenses increased $16.5 million, or 15%, to $128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $112.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. An increase of $4.3 million in Chile and Mexico was the result of the strengthening of the peso versus the U.S. dollar. In addition, an increase of $3.0 million
in Mexico was due to increased marketing efforts and asset retention training for agents and employees. Furthermore, an increase of $2.2 million in Chile was due to the impact of an impairment
of the value of business acquired ("VOBA") stemming from declining interest rates. An increase of $2.3 million in India was due to higher compensation costs in the asset management company
coupled with costs from PPIAC, which started operations in February 2005. An increase of $2.1 million in Hong Kong was primarily due to increased costs related to consolidation of our
mutual fund products, marketing costs, and compensation costs as well as DPAC unlocking.

Income
taxes decreased $13.1 million to an income tax benefit of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from income tax expense of $8.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004. A decrease of $8.9 million in Japan was primarily due to a tax benefit associated with the liquidation of the business in 2005. A decrease of
$7.3 million at corporate headquarters was due to the benefit from the American Jobs Creation Act in 2005 and foreign dividend activity that generated tax expense in 2004. As a result of the
foregoing factors, operating earnings increased $30.7 million, or 76%, to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $40.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

Net
realized/unrealized capital gains, as adjusted, decreased $9.2 million, or 53%, to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $17.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily related to a $4.7 million decrease in Chile due to lower realized gains on derivatives that are held to more effectively
match the invested asset portfolio to our policyholder liability risks. In addition, a decrease of $2.4 million in India related to a realized gain in 2004 on recovery of a previously impaired
debt security.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of other after-tax adjustments, net income available to common stockholders increased $14.8 million, or 23%, to
$79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net income
included the positive effect of other after-tax adjustments totaling $6.7 million, related to: (1) the positive effect of income from discontinued operations related to the
sale of our Argentine companies ($10.0 million) and (2) the negative effect of cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the implementation of SOP 03-1
($3.3 million).

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Premiums and other considerations increased $49.3 million, or 26%, to $241.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
$191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. An increase of $45.5 million in Chile was primarily a result of the strengthening of the Chilean peso versus the U.S. dollar
and higher sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies in 2004 following a year of decreased sales due to market contraction.

Fees
and other revenues increased $15.5 million, or 22%, to $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $70.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. An increase of $6.0 million in Hong Kong was a result of an increase in assets under management primarily due to the acquisition of Dao Heng Fund Management in 2004.
An increase of $4.6 million in Mexico was primarily a result of an increase in the number of retirement plan participants due to the acquisition of AFORE Tepeyac in February 2003 and the
acquisition of Principal Genera, S.A. de C.V., Operadora de Fondos de Inversión ("Genera") in July 2003. In addition, an increase of $3.5 million in India was primarily a
result of an increase in assets under management ("AUM") caused by record net customer cash flows and accounting for Principal PNB Asset Management Company using the full consolidation method of
accounting due to our majority ownership beginning third quarter 2003; prior to third quarter 2003, results were reported using equity method of accounting.

Net
investment income increased $54.1 million, or 39%, to $191.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $137.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to a $466.8 million, or 28%, increase in average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity investment in subsidiaries. In addition,
the increase was related to an increase in the annualized yield on average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity investment in subsidiaries, which was 8.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2004, compared to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Benefits,
claims and settlement expenses increased $93.6 million, or 35%, to $357.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $263.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. An $84.6 million increase in Chile was primarily a result of higher reserve expenses due to the strengthening of the Chilean peso versus the U.S. dollar and
higher sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies in 2004 following a year of decreased sales due to market contraction.

Operating
expenses increased $14.4 million, or 15%, to $112.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $97.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. An increase of $8.7 million in Mexico was primarily due to DPAC


and
VOBA unlocking, increased compensation expenses, higher postage and legal expenses to introduce a second investment option for our Mexico AFORE customers and the acquisition of Genera in
July 2003. In addition, an increase of $3.8 million in Hong Kong was primarily a result of increased marketing efforts, compensation costs and higher investment management fees caused by
an increase in assets under management due to the acquisition of Dao Heng Fund Management in 2004.

Income
tax expense increased $5.1 million, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $3.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. An increase of $3.2 million was primarily related to a planned 2005 dividend from Mexico. In addition, the increase was a result of an increase related to our Brazilian equity method
investment. These increases are partially offset as a result of enacted tax rate reductions in Mexico.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, operating earnings increased $5.8 million, or 17%, to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
$34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Net
realized/unrealized capital gains, as adjusted, increased $12.5 million, to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $4.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. An increase of $5.5 million in Chile was primarily due to a change in the fair value of non-hedged derivatives. An increase of
$4.3 million in Mexico was primarily due to realized gains on equity securities while restructuring our investment portfolios from equity securities to fixed income securities. In addition, an
increase of $2.3 million in India was primarily due to a realized gain on recovery of a previously impaired debt security.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of other after-tax adjustments, net income available to common stockholders increased $5.1 million, or 9%, to
$64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net income
available to common stockholders included the positive effect of other after-tax adjustments totaling $6.7 million, related to: (1) the positive effect of income from
discontinued operations related to the sale of our Argentine companies ($10.0 million) and (2) the negative effect of cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the
implementation of SOP 03-1 ($3.3 million). For the year ended December 31, 2003, net income included the positive effect of other after-tax adjustments totaling
$19.9 million, related to: (1) the positive effect of the change in the estimated loss on disposal of BT Financial Group ($21.8 million) and (2) the negative effect of the
loss from discontinued operations related to the sale of our Argentine companies ($1.9 million).

Life and Health Insurance Segment

Individual Life Insurance Trends

Our life insurance premiums have been influenced by both economic and industry trends. In addition, we have shifted our marketing emphasis to universal and
variable universal life insurance products from traditional life insurance products. Due to this shift in marketing emphasis, premiums related to our traditional life insurance products have declined,
while fee revenues from our universal and variable universal life insurance products have grown.

The
following table provides a summary of our individual universal and variable universal life insurance fee revenues and our individual traditional life insurance premiums for the years

Health Insurance Trends

The year 2005 saw good growth in group medical premium and fees and members due to improved pricing and market focus. While we continue to sell group medical
business in 35 states plus the District of Columbia, we have sharpened our focus on 13 states. Premium revenue has grown due to both price and membership increases. The
fee-for-service portion of our business had a drop in medical members and fees because of our competitive position in the market. Our fee-for-service
offering is available in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. Fees and members in the fee-for-service business were impacted by the acquisition of the Molloy Companies
on January 2, 2004. These changes have impacted the premium and fee trend during the three year period illustrated below.

Our
health insurance premium and fees for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Premiums and other considerations increased $170.5 million, or 6%, to $3,267.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from
$3,096.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Specialty benefits insurance premiums increased $119.5 million primarily due to strong sales and steady retention. Health
insurance premiums increased $94.9 million, primarily resulting from higher premium per member and an increase in average insured medical members. Partially offsetting these increases was a
decrease of $43.9 million in individual life insurance premiums, primarily a result of the continuation of a shift in marketing emphasis to universal and variable universal life insurance
products from traditional life insurance products and an increase in ceded reinsurance premium. Unlike traditional premium-based products, individual universal and variable universal life insurance
premiums are not reported as U.S. GAAP revenue.

Fees
and other revenues increased $22.4 million, or 5%, to $444.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $421.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. Fee revenues from our individual life insurance business increased $30.0 million, primarily due to growth in our fee-based universal and variable universal
life insurance business. Fee revenues from our health insurance business decreased $7.9 million, primarily due to a decrease in average fee-for-service medical members.

Net
investment income increased $13.3 million, or 2%, to $676.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $662.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase primarily relates to a $518.4, or 5%, increase in average invested assets and cash for the segment. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the
average annualized yield on invested assets and cash, which was 6.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004. This reflects lower
yields on fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages due in part to a lower interest rate environment.

Benefits,
claims and settlement expenses increased $105.5 million, or 4%, to $2,620.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,514.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004. Health insurance benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $66.0 million primarily due to increases in claim costs per member and average
members, even though loss ratios decreased. Likewise, despite lower loss ratios, specialty benefits insurance benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $58.9 million, primarily due to
growth in the business.


Dividends
to policyholders decreased $3.3 million, or 1%, to $288.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $291.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in the individual life insurance dividend interest crediting rates resulting from a declining interest rate environment.

Operating
expenses increased $77.6 million, or 8%, to $1,066.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $988.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. Specialty benefits insurance operating expenses increased $45.7 million due to growth in the business. Health insurance operating expenses increased
$29.5 million, primarily due to growth in the insured medical and wellness businesses and additional salary and benefit-related expenses.

Income
taxes increased $8.2 million, or 6%, to $138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $129.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2004. The effective income tax rate for the segment was 33% for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 34% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The effective income tax rates for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, were lower than the corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the interest exclusion from taxable income.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, operating earnings increased $18.2 million, or 7%, to $274.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from
$256.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net
realized/unrealized capital losses, as adjusted, decreased $6.6 million, or 74%, to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $8.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is due to fewer other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities including a $7.4 million recovery of previously impaired
securities received as the result of a litigation settlement offset in part by more losses related to the mark to market of derivative activities, a software impairment, and losses versus gains on the
sale of fixed maturity securities.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of a 2004 other after-tax adjustment, net income available to common stockholders increased $25.7 million, or
10%, to $272.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $246.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The other after-tax adjustment for the
year ended December 31, 2004, had a negative impact on net income of $0.9 million due to the cumulative effect of accounting change, a result of our implementation of SOP
03-1.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Premiums and other considerations increased $77.6 million, or 3%, to $3,096.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
$3,019.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Specialty benefits insurance premiums increased $93.1 million primarily due to strong sales and favorable retention. Health
insurance premiums increased $24.6 million, primarily due to rate increases partially offset by the establishment of a premium refund accrual for pending litigation related to a business exited
in the 1990's and by a decrease in average covered medical members. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $40.1 million in individual life insurance premiums, primarily a
result of a shift in marketing emphasis to universal and variable universal life insurance products from traditional life insurance products. Unlike traditional premium-based products, individual
universal and variable universal life insurance premiums are not reported as U.S. GAAP revenue.

Fees
and other revenues increased $83.0 million, or 24%, to $421.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $338.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Fee revenues from our individual life insurance business increased $45.3 million, primarily due to strong sales growth of universal and variable universal life
insurance products. Fee revenues from our health insurance business increased $36.6 million, primarily due to growth in our fee-for-service business resulting from our
acquisition of the Molloy Companies effective January 2, 2004.

Net
investment income increased $6.4 million, or 1%, to $662.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $656.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase primarily relates to a $542.2, or 6%, increase in average invested assets and cash for the segment. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the
average annualized yield on invested assets and cash, which was 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003. This reflects lower
yields on invested assets due to a lower interest rate environment.

Benefits,
claims and settlement expenses increased $57.0 million, or 2%, to $2,514.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $2,457.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Specialty benefits insurance benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $52.2 million, primarily due to growth in the business; however, loss
ratios generally improved over this period. Health insurance benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $34.9 million primarily due to increased claim costs per member. These increases
were partially offset by a $30.1 million decrease in the individual life insurance benefits, claims and settlement expenses, primarily due to a slower increase in reserves as a result of the
continuing shift to universal and variable universal life insurance products from traditional life insurance products and to lower death claims.

Dividends
to policyholders decreased $9.2 million, or 3%, to $291.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $301.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The decrease is primarily related to the dividend scale decrease effective in February 2003 and a decrease in the individual life insurance dividend interest crediting
rates resulting from a declining interest rate environment.


Operating
expenses increased $96.9 million, or 11%, to $988.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $891.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Individual life insurance operating expenses increased $45.0 million primarily due to increased DPAC amortization resulting from the refinements made to the DPAC
valuation models for the individual universal and variable universal life insurance and traditional life insurance businesses in 2003 which reduced DPAC amortization in 2003. Individual life insurance
operating expenses also increased as a result of increases in sales. Health insurance operating expenses increased $28.4 million, primarily the result of the acquisition of the Molloy Companies
partially offset by lower operating expenses on the insured medical business due to a reduction in members and lower premium taxes. Specialty benefits insurance operating expenses increased
$23.5 million due to growth in the business.

Income
taxes increased $7.3 million, or 6%, to $129.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $122.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. The effective income tax rate for the segment was 34% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
were lower than the corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to interest exclusion from taxable income.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, operating earnings increased $15.0 million, or 6%, to $256.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
$241.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Net
realized/unrealized capital losses, as adjusted, decreased $7.7 million, or 46%, to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $16.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted from fewer other than temporary declines in the value of certain fixed maturity securities.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of an other after-tax adjustment, net income available to common stockholders increased $21.8 million, or 10%,
to $246.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net income
available to common stockholders included the negative effect of an other after-tax adjustment of $0.9 million due to a cumulative effect of accounting change, a result of our
implementation of SOP 03-1.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Total operating revenues decreased $36.1 million to a negative $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from a negative
$23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net investment income decreased $21.5 million primarily due to the increase in investment expenses related to the acquisition
of a significant variable interest in a coal-based synthetic fuel production facility in June 2004. The increase in investment expense from this investment is more than offset by a
decrease in income taxes due to Section 29 tax credits generated from fuel production. In addition, the decrease in total revenues was partially due to a decrease of $7.7 million in fee
revenue for transitional services provided to CitiMortgage, Inc., in the prior year, related to the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., which is mostly offset by a
corresponding change in total expense. Furthermore, the decrease in total revenues was due to a $5.5 million increase in inter-segment eliminations included in this segment, which was offset by
a corresponding change in total expenses.


Total expenses decreased $54.8 million to a negative $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from a positive $47.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The decrease in total expenses was partially due to a $23.0 million decrease in interest related to federal income tax audit activities as well as a
$13.5 million decrease in interest related to the reduction of corporate debt. In addition, the decrease in total expenses was due to a $7.3 million decrease in transitional services
provided to CitiMortgage, Inc., in the prior year, related to the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, which is mostly offset in total revenue. A decrease in total expense of
$7.2 million was related to a prior year prepayment penalty recognized on the redemption of our surplus notes due 2024. Furthermore, inter-segment eliminations included in this segment
increased $5.5 million, resulting in a decrease in total expenses.

Income
tax benefits decreased $2.0 million, or 4%, to $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $50.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating loss before income taxes and preferred stock dividends, a change in income tax reserves established for IRS tax
matters, as well as a tax benefit associated with the sale of a foreign investment in 2004. Largely offsetting these decreases in income tax benefits are a full year of Section 29 tax credits
from our investment in a synthetic fuel production facility.

Preferred
stock dividends were $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, with no corresponding activity for the year ended December 31, 2004. The preferred
stock dividends were a result of issuing preferred stock in June 2005.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, operating loss increased $1.0 million, or 5%, to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $20.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net
realized/unrealized capital losses, as adjusted, increased $40.0 million to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $26.4 million net
realized/unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to less mark to market gains on certain seed money investments, increased losses on sales of
invested assets, and the impairment of an equity partnership interest.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of other after-tax adjustments, net income available to common stockholders increased $23.5 million to
$29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net income included
the positive effect of other after-tax adjustments totaling $64.5 million related to: (1) a decrease in income tax reserves and associated interest related to IRS tax matters
($42.2 million) and (2) gains on sales of real estate properties that qualify for discontinued operations treatment ($22.3 million).

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Total operating revenues decreased $49.8 million to negative $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from a positive
$26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net investment income decreased $50.2 million largely due to a decrease in average annualized investment yields for the segment
and unusually high mortgage prepayment income in the prior year. Contributing to the decline in yields is the increase in investment expenses related to the acquisition of a significant variable
interest in a coal-based synthetic fuel production facility in June 2004. The increase in investment expense from this investment is more than offset by a decrease in income taxes
due to tax credits generated from the fuel production. In addition, the decrease in total revenues was partially due to a $8.2 million increase in inter-segment eliminations included in this
segment, which was offset by a corresponding change in total expenses. Partially offsetting the decrease in total revenue was an increase of $11.1 million in fee revenue for transitional
services that are provided to CitiMortgage, Inc. on a temporary basis related to the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., which is mostly offset by a corresponding change in
total expense.

Total
expenses decreased $7.7 million, or 14%, to $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $55.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The decrease in total expenses was largely due to a $19.3 million decrease in interest expense related to the reduction in corporate debt. Inter-segment eliminations
included in this segment increased $8.2 million, resulting in a decrease in total expenses. The decrease in total expenses was offset by an increase of $10.8 million for transitional
services that are provided to CitiMortgage, Inc. on a temporary basis related to the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., which is mostly offset in total revenue. In addition,
the decrease in total expenses was offset by an increase of $7.2 million related to a prepayment penalty recognized in 2004 on redemption of our surplus notes due 2024.

Income
tax benefits increased $34.2 million to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. The increase was primarily due to tax credits on our investment in a synthetic fuel production facility as well as an increase in pre-tax operating loss.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, operating loss increased $7.9 million, or 63%, to $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $12.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Net
realized/unrealized capital gains, as adjusted, decreased $18.2 million, or 41%, to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $44.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to less mark to market gains on certain seed money investments and the impact of foreign currency transactions gains and


losses.
These losses were partially offset by gains on sales of invested assets in 2004 and fewer other than temporary declines in the value of certain fixed maturity securities.

As
a result of the foregoing factors and the inclusion of other after-tax adjustments, net income available to common stockholders decreased $63.3 million, or 91%, to
$6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net income included
the positive effect of other after-tax adjustments totaling $37.2 million related to: (1) a decrease in income tax reserves established for contested IRS tax audit matters
($28.9 million) and (2) the cumulative effect of accounting change, a result of our implementation of FIN 46 ($8.3 million).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our legal entity organizational structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. Following is a simplified organizational
structure.

The Holding Companies: Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Principal Financial Services, Inc.

Liquidity
describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations. Our parent holding company, Principal Financial
Group, Inc., is a Delaware business corporation, whose assets primarily consist of the outstanding capital stock of its subsidiaries. As a holding company, Principal Financial
Group Inc.'s ability to meet cash requirements, including the payments of dividends on common stock and the repurchase of stock, substantially depends upon dividends from subsidiaries,
primarily Principal Life.

Dividends from Principal Life

The payment of stockholder dividends by Principal Life to its parent company is limited by Iowa laws. Under Iowa laws, Principal Life may pay dividends only from
the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa ("the Commissioner") to pay a stockholder dividend if such a
stockholder dividend would exceed certain statutory limitations. The current statutory limitation is the greater of:

•

10%
of Principal Life's statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year-end; or

•

the
statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year.

Iowa
law gives the Commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. Based on this limitation and 2005 statutory results, Principal Life could pay
approximately $630.7 million in stockholder dividends in 2006 without exceeding the statutory limitation. Principal Life was able to pay approximately $591.1 million in statutory
dividends in 2005 based on its 2004 statutory financial results without being subject to the restrictions on payment of extraordinary stockholder dividends.

On
February 28, 2006, Principal Life declared a common stock dividend to its parent company of up to $625.0 million, $425.0 million of which was accrued as of
February 28, 2006.

On
November 2, 2005, Principal Life declared a dividend of up to $300.0 million. Total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent company in 2005 were
$200.0 million.

On
May 19, 2004, Principal Life declared a dividend of up to $1.2 billion. Total ordinary stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent company in 2004 were
$494.0 million. In March 2004, Principal Life redeemed $200.0 million of its surplus notes at a cost of $207.2 million. Principal Life and the Commissioner have agreed that
this $207.2 million will be applied against Principal Life's 2004 ordinary dividend capacity. Principal Life requested and received permission from the Commissioner to pay an extraordinary
dividend in the amount of $700.0 million, of which $630.0 million was paid as of December 31, 2004.


Shelf Registration

Registration Statement.

Although we generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal
operations, periodically the need may arise to issue debt to fund internal expansion, acquisitions, investment opportunities and retirement of existing debt and equity. In December 2003, we
filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective on June 30, 2004. The shelf registration totals $3.0 billion, with the ability to
issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of Principal Financial Group, Inc ("PFG") and trust preferred securities of three
subsidiary trusts. If we issue additional securities, we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the securities for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures,
investments in subsidiaries, share repurchase, acquisitions and refinancing of debt, including commercial paper and other short-term indebtedness. Principal Financial Services, Inc.
unconditionally guarantees our obligations with respect to one or more series of debt securities described in the shelf registration statement.

Preferred Stock Issuances.

On June 16, 2005, we issued 13.0 million shares of
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock under our shelf registration for net proceeds of $542.0 million. Substantially all of the preferred securities proceeds were used to
repurchase shares of outstanding common stock. Following our issuance of perpetual preferred stock, we now have the ability to issue up to $2.45 billion of debt securities, preferred stock,
common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of PFG and trust preferred securities of three subsidiary trusts, under the shelf registration.

Preferred Stock Dividend Restrictions and Payments.

The certificates of designations for the
preferred stock restrict the declaration of preferred dividends if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy, net income or stockholders' equity levels. As of December 31, 2005, we have no
preferred dividend restrictions.

On
September 30, 2005, we paid a dividend of $9.4 million, equal to $1.59 per share on Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and equal to
$0.47 per share on Series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, to stockholders of record as of September 1, 2005. On December 30, 2005, we paid a dividend of
$8.3 million, equal to $1.39 per share on Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and equal to $0.41 per share on Series B non-cumulative
perpetual preferred stock, to stockholders of record as of December 15, 2005.

Common Stock Issued and Treasury Stock Acquired

Another source of liquidity is issuance of our common stock. Proceeds from the issuance of our common stock were $59.9 million and $41.2 million in
2005 and 2004, respectively.

In
2005, we paid $182.2 million in dividends to common stockholders. We paid a dividend of $0.65 per share on December 16, 2005, to stockholders of record as of
November 17, 2005. In 2004, we paid $166.5 million, or $0.55 per share, in dividends to common stockholders.

Our
Board of Directors has authorized various repurchase programs under which we are allowed to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. Shares repurchased under these programs
are accounted for as treasury stock, carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to stockholders' equity. The repurchases are made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions,
from time to time, depending on market conditions.

In
November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2005, no
purchases have been made under this program.

In
June 2005, following our Board of Directors authorization of the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock, we entered into an accelerated
stock repurchase agreement with a third party investment banker for approximately 13.7 million shares of our common stock with an initial payment of $542.3 million. This transaction was
subject to a market pricing adjustment provision based on the volume weighted average market price over the execution period, which could be settled in shares or cash. On October 3, 2005, we
elected to settle in cash. On November 10, 2005, the transaction was completed for an additional payment of $84.0 million. We do not intend to make further purchases under this program.

In
March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common stock. This program began after the completion of
the May 2004 repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the May 2004 and March 2005 repurchase
programs, we acquired 8.4 million shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of $325.0 million in 2005. Of that amount, $75.0 million was acquired under the May 2004
repurchase program and $250.0 million was acquired under the March 2005 repurchase program. The share repurchase program announced in March 2005 was completed in May 2005.

Our
Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $700.0 million of our outstanding common stock in May 2004, a repurchase program of up to
$300.0 million of our outstanding common stock in May 2003 and a repurchase program of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock in November 2002. We acquired
21.7 million and 15.0 million shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of $772.0 million and $453.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.


Sources
of liquidity also include facilities for short-term and long-term borrowing as needed, arranged through our intermediate holding company, Principal
Financial Services Inc. ("PFSI"), and its subsidiaries. See "Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments" below.

Principal Life

Historically, the primary cash flow sources for Principal Life have been premiums from life and health insurance products, pension and annuity deposits, asset
management fee revenues, administrative services fee revenues, income from investments, proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments, long-term debt and short-term
borrowings. Cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries, income and other taxes, current operating expenses, payment of dividends to policyholders,
payments in connection with investments acquired, payments made to acquire subsidiaries, payment of dividends to parent, and payments relating to policy and contract surrenders, withdrawals, policy
loans, interest expense and repayment of short-term borrowings and long-term debt.

Principal
Life maintains investment strategies generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. Products having liabilities with longer
lives, such as life insurance and full-service payout pension products, are matched with assets having similar estimated lives such as mortgage loans, long-term bonds and
private placement bonds. Shorter-term liabilities are matched with investments such as short and medium-term fixed maturities. In addition, highly liquid, high quality
short-term investments are held to fund anticipated operating expenses, surrenders, withdrawals and development and maintenance expenses associated with new products and technologies. Our
privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments are generally less liquid than our publicly traded fixed maturity securities. These asset classes
represented approximately 40% and 42% of the value of our consolidated invested assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 respectively. See Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk" for a discussion of duration matching.

Life
insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow from operations, as measured by the amount by which cash inflows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyholders
and normal operating expenses as they are incurred. The remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for
writing and acquiring new business. It is important to match the investment portfolio maturities to the cash flow demands of the type of annuity, investment or insurance product being provided.
Principal Life continuously monitors benefits, surrenders and maturities to provide projections of future cash requirements. As part of this monitoring process, Principal Life performs cash flow
testing of many of its assets and liabilities under various scenarios to evaluate the adequacy of reserves. In developing its investment strategy, Principal Life establishes a level of cash and
securities which, combined with expected net cash inflows from operations, maturities of fixed maturity investments and principal payments on mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage loans,
are believed adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term benefit and expense payment obligations. There can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits
and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since withdrawal and surrender levels are
influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment and the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of Principal Life.

Principal
Life takes into account asset-liability management considerations in the product development and design process. Contract terms of 98% of Principal Life's universal and
variable universal life insurance products as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, include surrender and withdrawal provisions which mitigate the risk of losses due to early withdrawals. These
provisions generally do one or more of the following: limit the amount of penalty-free withdrawals; limit the circumstances under which withdrawals are permitted; or assess a surrender
charge or market value adjustment relating to the underlying assets. The market value adjustment feature in Principal Life's fixed annuity products adjusts the surrender value of a contract in the
event of surrender prior to the end of the contract period to protect Principal Life against losses due to higher interest rates at the time of surrender.

Our
GICs and funding agreements contain provisions limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.

International Asset Management and Accumulation Operations

Our Brazilian, Hong Kong, Chilean, Indian, and Mexican operations produced positive cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, our Chilean, Indian and Mexican operations produced positive cash flow from operations. These cash flows have been historically maintained at the local
country level for strategic expansion purposes and local capital requirements. Our international
operations have required infusions of capital primarily to fund acquisitions and to a lesser extent, to meet the cash outflow and capital requirements of certain operations. Our capital funding of
these operations is consistent with our long-term strategy to establish viable companies that can sustain future growth from internally generated sources. Based on reviews of our current
capital needs and strategic opportunities within our foreign operations, we have repatriated a portion of the capital from certain countries in 2005.

Sources and Uses of Cash of Consolidated Operations

Activity, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, provides relevant information regarding our sources and uses of cash. The following discussion
of our operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows excludes cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations, which were as follows:

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,384.2 million, $2,262.8 million and $3,008.0 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 is due to an increase in premiums and fees and other revenues received. This increase
is partially offset by increased taxes paid in 2005, largely due to the 2005 payment of an Internal Revenue Service deficiency related to the examination for 1999-2001. The decrease in
cash provided by our continuing operations in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily due to a decrease in mortgage escrow balances held in our banking operations that were closed out by the


purchaser
(or acquirer) as a result of the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. to CitiMortgage, Inc., as well as an increase in the net acquisition of mortgage loans held for
sale. These decreases were partially offset by the settlement of intercompany arrangements received as a result of the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $1,608.0 million, $3,184.6 million and $3,505.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. The decrease in cash used in 2005 for investing activities compared to 2004 is primarily due to a decrease in the net acquisitions of available-for-sale
securities and mortgage loans. Offsetting this was the sale of subsidiaries, including the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. to CitiMortgage, Inc., in 2004, with no
corresponding activity in 2005. The decrease in cash used in 2004 for investing activities compared to 2003 is due to cash received from the sale of subsidiaries, in addition to an increase in net
sales of mortgage loans and real estate. Offsetting these was an increase in the net acquisition of available-for-sale securities in 2004 over 2003.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $414.5 million, $182.8 million and $959.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to a preferred stock issuance in 2005, increases in short term borrowing as well as a
reduction in long term debt repayments in the current year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net deposits of investment contracts, an increase in treasury stock acquisitions and
the accelerated stock repurchase settlement. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase in debt payments in 2004, an increase in
treasury stock acquisitions as well as a decrease in bank deposits. This was partially offset by an increase in investment contract deposits, net of withdrawals.

Given
the historical cash flow of our subsidiaries and the financial results of these subsidiaries, we believe the cash flow from our consolidated operating activities over the next year
will provide sufficient liquidity for our operations, as well as satisfy interest payments and any payments related to debt servicing.

Impacts of Income Taxes

The Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") has completed examinations of the U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns for 2001 and prior years. The Service
is currently examining returns for 2002 and 2003. The Service's completion of the examinations for the years 1999 - 2001 resulted in notices of deficiency dated
December 29, 2004, and March 1, 2005. We paid the deficiencies (approximately $444.0 million for 1999 and 2000, and $1.3 million for 2001, including interest) in the first
quarter of 2005 and plan to file claims for refund relating to the disputed adjustments. The majority of the deficiencies are attributable to the disallowance of carrybacks of capital losses, net
operating losses and foreign tax credits arising in years after 2001. We expect the Service to allow some of the carrybacks within the next year upon completion of the audit of the returns for the
years in which the losses and credits arose. The remainder of the deficiencies are attributable to both contested issues and adjustments that we have accepted. We believe that we have adequate
defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution of the contested issues could take several years while legal remedies are pursued. Consequently, we do not
expect the ultimate resolution of issues in tax years 1999 - 2001 to have a material impact on
our net income. Similarly, we believe there are adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, any challenges that might arise in tax years subsequent to 2001.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law. The Act includes a repatriation provision granting U.S. corporations a special
deduction of 85% of certain qualifying dividends from their foreign subsidiaries. A company could elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that are repatriated in its 2005 tax year. Based
on the interpretive guidance issued to date by the Service, we currently believe that we will elect to utilize this repatriation provision in our 2005 tax year. Although it is dependent on a number of
factors, the amount that we are considering for application under this provision is approximately $27.0 million. Our current tax accrual reflects application of the provisions of the Act.

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges

The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is a measure of our ability to cover fixed costs with current period earnings. A high ratio indicates that earnings are
sufficiently covering committed expenses. The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, our ratios of:

•

earnings
to fixed charges before interest credited on investment products; and

•

earnings
to fixed charges.

We calculate the ratio of "earnings to fixed charges before interest credited on investment products" by dividing the sum of income from continuing operations
before income taxes (BT), interest expense (I), interest factor of rental expense (IF) less undistributed income from equity investees (E) by the sum of interest
expense (I), interest factor of


rental
expense (IF) and dividends on majority-owned subsidiary redeemable preferred securities (non-intercompany) (D). The formula for this ratio is:
(BT+I+IF-E)/(I+IF+D).

We
calculate the ratio of "earnings to fixed charges" by dividing the sum of income from continuing operations before income taxes (BT), interest expense (I), interest factor of
rental expense (IF) less undistributed income from equity investees (E) and the addition of interest credited on investment products (IC) by interest expense (I), interest
factor of rental expense (IF), dividends on majority-owned subsidiary redeemable preferred securities (non-intercompany) (D) and interest credited on investment
products (IC). The formula for this calculation is: (BT+I+IF-E+IC)/(I+IF+D+IC). "Interest credited on investment products" includes interest paid on guaranteed investment contracts,
funding agreements and other investment-only pension products. Similar to debt, these products have a total fixed return and a fixed maturity date.

Excludes
short-term liabilities, other policyholder funds, taxes and short-term debt as these are not long-term and/or not contractual in nature.
Also excludes obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans as benefit payments will be made under a funded plan and will not require company contributions or payments within a
five-year period. In addition, separate qccount liabilities are excluded. Separate account liabilities represent the fair market value of funds that are separately administered by the
Company. Generally, the separate account contract owner, rather than the Company, bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account liabilities are legally segregated and are not subject
to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. Net deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are not reflected in
the consolidated statement of operations. The separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets.

(2)

Includes
GICs, funding agreements (described below), individual fixed annuities, universal life insurance, and other investment-type contracts.

Our
guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements contain provisions limiting early surrenders, which typically include penalties for early surrenders, minimum notice
requirements or, in the case of funding agreements with survivor options, minimum pre-death holding periods and specific maximum amounts.

Funding
agreements include those issued directly to nonqualified institutional investors, as well as to three separate programs where the funding agreements have been issued directly or
indirectly to unconsolidated special purpose entities. Claims for principal and interest under funding agreements are afforded equal priority to claims of life insurance and annuity policyholders
under insolvency provisions of Iowa Insurance Laws.

We
are authorized to issue up to $4.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in 1998 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an unaffiliated
entity in non-U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, $3,203.6 million and $3,867.0 million, respectively, of liabilities were being held with respect to the
issuance outstanding under this program.

In
addition, we are authorized to issue up to $7.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in 2001 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an
unaffiliated entity in both domestic and international markets. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, $4,744.5 million and $5,462.3 million, respectively, of


liabilities
were being held with respect to the issuance outstanding under this program. We do not anticipate any new issuance activity under this program, given the March 2004 establishment of
the SEC-registered program described in the next paragraph and our December 2005 termination of the dealership agreement for that program.

We
are authorized to issue up to $4.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in March 2004 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by
unaffiliated entities in both domestic and international markets. Under this program, both the notes and the supporting funding agreements are registered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2005,
$3,667.9 million of liabilities are being held with respect to the issuance outstanding under this program. In contrast with direct funding agreements, GIC issuances and the other two funding
agreement-backed
medium term note programs described above, Principal Life's payment obligations on each funding agreement issued under this SEC-registered program are guaranteed by Principal Financial
Group, Inc. This program was amended in February 2006 to authorize issuance of up to an additional $5.0 billion.

The
contractholder funds line item includes expected future obligations for universal life and other investment-type contracts that are based on assumptions as to future
premium, mortality, interest, lapse, and surrender experience.

(3)

Future
policy benefits and claims reflect liabilities such as expected death claims, medical claims and disability claims on products that have insurance risk. In general, this line
item represents the our expected future obligations based on assumptions for future premium, mortality, morbidity, lapse and surrender experience.

(4)

The
following are included in long-term debt:

On
November 3, 2005, Principal International de Chile S.A., a wholly owned indirect subsidiary, entered into long-term borrowing agreements with two Chilean banks in
the amount of US $93.9 million. This debt is denominated in Unidades de Formento ("UF"), a Chilean inflation-indexed, peso-denominated monetary unit. Of this amount, US
$49.0 million of UF +4.59% notes and US $44.9 million of UF +4.93% notes mature on November 3, 2011. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 3 and
November 3 each year. The debt outstanding and interest expense will vary due to fluctuations in the Chilean peso to US dollar exchange rates and Chilean inflation.

On
August 25, 1999, Principal Financial Group (Australia) Holdings Pty. Limited, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary, issued $665.0 million of unsecured redeemable
long-term debt. Of this amount, $200.0 million of 7.95% notes matured on August 15, 2004, with the remaining $465.0 million in 8.2% notes due August 15, 2009.
On December 28, 2001, all of the long-term debt obligations of Principal Financial Group (Australia) Holdings Pty. Limited were assumed by its parent, Principal Financial
Services, Inc.

On
March 10, 1994, Principal Life issued $300.0 million of surplus notes, including $200.0 million due March 1, 2024, at a 7.875% annual interest rate and the
remaining $100.0 million due March 1, 2044, at an 8% annual interest rate. None of our affiliates hold any portion of the notes. Each payment of interest and principal on the notes,
however, may be made only with the prior approval of the Commissioner and only to the extent that Principal Life has sufficient surplus earnings to make such payments.

After
receiving approval from the Commissioner, the surplus notes due March 1, 2024, were optionally redeemed by Principal Life on March 1, 2004, in whole at a redemption
price of approximately 103.6% of par. Total cash paid for the surplus note redemption on March 1, 2004, was $207.2 million.

Subject
to Commissioner approval, the notes due March 1, 2044, may be redeemed at Principal Life's election on or after March 1, 2014, in whole or in part at a redemption
price of approximately 102.3% of par. The approximate 2.3% premium is scheduled to gradually diminish over the following ten years. These notes may be redeemed on or after March 1, 2024, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus interest accrued to the date of redemption.

Long-term
debt also includes $236.4 million of mortgages and other notes payable related to real estate developments. We, including certain subsidiaries, had
$135.0 million in credit facilities as of December 31, 2005, with various financial institutions, in addition to obtaining loans with various lenders to finance these developments.
Outstanding principal balances as of December 31, 2005, range from $0.3 million to $97.5 million per development with interest rates generally ranging from 5.5% to 8.6%.
Outstanding principal balances as of December 31, 2004, range from $0.4 million to $98.7 million per development with interest rates generally ranging from 6.0% to 8.6%.
Outstanding debt is secured by the underlying real estate properties, which were reported as real estate on our consolidated statements of financial position with a carrying value of
$284.1 million and $298.7 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(5)

Certificates
of deposit are reported as other liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial position.

(6)

Other
long-term liabilities include other liabilities reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position that are contractual, non-cancelable and
long-term in nature. This line item excludes accruals and short-term items in the amount of $2,415.4 million.

(7)

As
a lessee, we lease office space, data processing equipment and office furniture and equipment under various operating leases.

(8)

Purchase
obligations include material contracts where we have a non-cancelable commitment to purchase goods and services in addition to commitments to originate loans and
purchase investments.


Contractual Commitments

In connection with our banking business, we make additional commitments to extend credit, which are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no
violation of any conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. A majority of these
commitments are lines of credit and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash funding requirements. We evaluate
each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The total commitments to fund loans were $117.5 million as of December 31, 2005.

Short-Term Debt

$221.3 million of assets pledged as support, respectively. Assets pledged consisted primarily of commercial mortgages and securities. Our credit facilities also include a $600.0 million
back-stop facility to provide 100% support for our commercial paper program, of which there were no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2005.

The
weighted-average interest rates on short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, were 4.5% and 2.7%, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Variable Interest Entities.

We have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and
other entities where we have a variable interest as described in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4 Variable
Interest Entities." We do not have a direct or contingent obligation related to our unconsolidated variable interest entities other than described below.

Synthetic Fuel Production Facility.

In June 2004, we acquired a significant variable interest
in a coal-based synthetic fuel production facility where we are not the primary beneficiary. Our minority ownership interest was acquired in exchange for consideration of
$37.0 million, which is primarily comprised of a non-recourse note payable for $36.0 million, as well as a commitment to fund our pro-rata share of the
operations. We have also agreed to make additional payments to the seller based on our pro-rata allocation of the tax credits generated by the facility. The synthetic fuel produced at the
facility through 2007 qualifies for tax credits pursuant to Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code (currently credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007). Our obligation to support
the entity's future operations is, therefore, limited to the tax benefit we expect to receive.

Retained Interests in Securitized Assets.

We, along with other contributors, sell commercial mortgage
loans in securitization transactions to trusts. As these trusts are classified as a qualifying special purpose entity pursuant to the guidance of SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities — A Replacement of FASB
Statement 125,

they are not required to be consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46R. We retain primary servicing responsibility and may retain other
immaterial interests. We receive annual servicing fees approximating 0.01% of the assets we are servicing, which approximates cost. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair values of retained
interests related to the securitizations of commercial mortgage loans were $321.0 million and $304.3 million, respectively. The investors and the securitization entities have no recourse
to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The value of our retained interests is subject primarily to credit risk.

Guarantees and Indemnifications.

In the normal course of business, we have provided guarantees to
third parties primarily related to a former subsidiary, joint ventures and industrial revenue bonds. These agreements generally expire from 2005 through 2019. The maximum exposure under these
agreements as of December 31, 2005, was approximately $193.0 million; however, we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required and therefore have not accrued
for a liability on our consolidated statements of financial position. Should we be required to perform under these guarantees, we generally could recover a portion of the loss from third parties
through recourse provisions included in agreements with such parties, the sale of assets held as collateral that can be liquidated in the event that performance


is
required under the guarantees or other recourse generally available to us, minimizing the impact to net income. The fair value of such guarantees issued after January 1, 2003, was determined
to be insignificant.

In
connection with the 2002 sale of BT Financial Group, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser, Westpac, for among other things, the costs associated with potential late filings
made by BT Financial Group in New Zealand prior to Westpac's ownership, up to a maximum of A$250.0 million Australian dollars (approximately U.S. $184.0 million as of
December 31, 2005). New Zealand securities regulations allow Australian issuers to issue their securities in New Zealand provided that certain documents are appropriately filed with the New
Zealand Registrar of Companies. Specifically, the regulations require that any amendments to constitutions and compliance plans be filed in New Zealand. In April 2003, the New Zealand
Securities Commission ("the Commission") opined that such late filings would result in certain New Zealand investors having a right to return of their investment plus interest at 10% per annum from
the date of investment. This technical issue affected many in the industry. On April 15, 2004, the New Zealand government enacted legislation that will provide issuers, including
BT Financial Group, the opportunity for retroactive relief from such late filing violations. The law allows issuers to apply for judicial validation of non-compliant issuances
resulting from late filings. The law further provides that judicial relief is mandatory and unconditional unless an investor was materially prejudiced by the late filing. Such judicial relief has been
granted to BT Financial Group and Westpac with regard to the vast majority of affected investors. As a result, we do not believe that this matter will result in a material adverse effect on our
business or financial position. It is possible, however, that it could have a material adverse effect on net income in a particular quarter or annual period.

On
December 24, 2004, Westpac lodged several warranty and indemnification claims related to the sale of BT Financial Group. Under the sale agreements, certain warranty
claims were required to be lodged by December 31, 2004. The claims aggregate approximately A$50.0 million Australian dollars (approximately U.S. $37.0 million) with the majority
of the claims (approximately A$45.0 million Australian dollars, or U.S. $33.0 million) related to fund pricing and accounting issues around a tax asset called future income tax benefit
("FITB"). FITB is an asset used in calculating unit pricing of funds. Westpac claims that BT Financial Group incorrectly accrued FITB assets in valuing asset portfolios of BT funds in Australia
and New Zealand and that as a result fund values were overstated. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. Although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or reasonably estimate
possible losses, we do not believe that it would result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. It is possible, however, that it could have a material adverse effect on net
income in a particular quarter or annual period.

We
are also subject to various other indemnification obligations issued in conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the sale of BT Financial Group, Principal Residential
Mortgage, Inc., and other divestitures, acquisitions and financing transactions whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Certain portions of these indemnifications
may be capped, while other portions are not subject to such limitations; therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under the indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. While we are
unable to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these indemnifications, we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments would be required under
such indemnifications and therefore such indemnifications would not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or net income. The fair value of such indemnifications
issued after January 1, 2003, was determined to be insignificant.

Investments

We had total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2005, of $127.0 billion, of which $57.5 billion were invested assets. The rest of our
total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk. Because we generally do not bear any investment risk on assets held in separate
accounts, the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets. Of our invested assets, $54.4 billion were held by our U.S. operations and the remaining
$3.1 billion were held by our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment.

U.S. Investment Operations

Our U.S. invested assets are managed by Principal Global Investors, a subsidiary of Principal Life. Our primary investment objective is to maximize
after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters. We seek to protect policyholders' benefits by optimizing the risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, through
asset/liability matching, reducing the credit risk, avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer, maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset
concentrations through diversification. We are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk:

•

credit
risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest;

•

interest
rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves; and

•

equity
risk, relating to adverse fluctuations in a particular common stock.


Our
ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. We devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. We manage credit
risk through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. Our Investment Committee, appointed by our Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing all investment policies and approving or
authorizing all investments, except the Executive Committee of the Board must approve any investment transaction exceeding $500.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, there are ten members
on the Investment Committee, one of whom is a member of our Board of Directors. The remaining members are senior management members representing various areas of our company.

We
also seek to reduce call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates in individual investments. We limit our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty
prior to maturity at the option of the issuer,
and we require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk that the issuer will exercise such option. We assess option risk in all investments we make and, when we take that risk,
we price for it accordingly.

Our
Fixed Income Securities Committee, consisting of fixed income securities senior management members, approves the credit rating for the fixed maturity securities we purchase. Teams of
security analysts organized by industry focus either on the public or private markets and analyze and monitor these investments. In addition, we have teams who specialize in residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and public below investment grade securities. We establish a credit reviewed list of approved public issuers
to provide an efficient way for our portfolio managers to purchase liquid bonds for which credit review has already been completed. Issuers remain on the list for one year unless removed by our
analysts. Our analysts monitor issuers on the list on a continuous basis with a formal review documented annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer. The analysis includes both
fundamental and technical factors. The fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer.

The
qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness. In addition, technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap
levels are monitored.

Our
Fixed Income Securities Committee also reviews private transactions on a continuous basis to assess the quality ratings of our privately placed investments. We regularly review our
investments to determine whether we should re-rate them, employing the following criteria:

•

material
declines in the issuer's revenues or margins;

•

significant
management or organizational changes;

•

significant
uncertainty regarding the issuer's industry;

•

debt
service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry-specific thresholds;

•

violation
of financial covenants; and

•

other
business factors that relate to the issuer.

A
dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage portfolio. We apply a variety of strategies to minimize credit risk in our
commercial mortgage loan portfolio. When considering the origination of new commercial mortgage loans, we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property, make a
physical assessment of the underlying security, conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices. We use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and a
majority of existing loans within the portfolio. The proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns. Our lending guidelines are
designed to encourage 75% or less loan-to-value ratios and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times. We analyze investments outside of these guidelines based
on cash flow quality, tenancy and other factors. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio at origination for brick and mortar commercial mortgages in our portfolio was 67% and
the debt service coverage ratio at loan inception was 1.8 times as of December 31, 2005.

We
have limited exposure to equity risk in our common stock portfolio. Equity securities accounted for only 1% of our U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2005.

Our
investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation. In addition, we diversify our product portfolio
offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates. Those features include adjustable crediting rates, policy surrender charges and market
value adjustments on liquidations. For further information on our management of interest rate risk, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk".

Overall Composition of U.S. Invested Assets

U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2005, were predominantly of high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit, industry
and geographic location. Asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products. As shown in the following table, the major categories of U.S. invested
assets are fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages. The remainder is invested in real estate, residential mortgage loans,


equity
securities and other assets. In addition, policy loans are included in our invested assets. The following discussion analyzes the composition of U.S. invested assets, but excludes invested
assets of the participating separate accounts.

The following tables present the yield and investment income, excluding net realized/unrealized gains and losses for our U.S. invested assets. The annualized
yield on U.S. invested assets and on cash and cash equivalents was 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004. We calculate
annualized yields using a simple average of asset classes at the beginning and end of the reporting period.

Fixed Maturity Securities

Fixed maturity securities consist of short-term investments, publicly traded debt securities, privately placed debt securities and redeemable
preferred stock, and represented 74% and 73% of total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The fixed maturity securities portfolio was
comprised, based on carrying amount, of 69% in publicly traded fixed maturity securities and 31% in privately placed fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2005 and 67% in publicly traded
fixed maturity securities and 33% in privately placed fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2004. Included in the privately placed category as of December 31, 2005, and
December 31,


2004,
were $6.5 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, of securities eligible for resale to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. Fixed
maturity securities were diversified by category of issuer as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, as shown in the following table:

We held $8,321.5 million of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities as of December 31, 2005, and $7,393.4 million as of
December 31, 2004.

We
believe that it is desirable to hold residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification
characteristics. Our portfolio is comprised of GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC pass-through securities. In addition, our residential collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio offers structural
features that allow cash flows to be matched to our liabilities.

Commercial
mortgage-backed securities provide high levels of credit protection, diversification, reduced event risk and enhanced liquidity. Commercial mortgage-backed securities are
predominantly comprised of rated large pool securitizations that are individually and collectively diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion.

We
purchase asset-backed securities ("ABS") to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturity securities portfolio and to provide attractive returns. The principal risks in
holding asset-backed securities are structural and credit risks. Structural risks include the security's priority in the issuer's capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds
from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. Credit risks involve issuer/servicer risk where collateral values can become impaired in the event of servicer credit deterioration.

Our
ABS portfolio is diversified both by type of asset and by issuer. We actively monitor holdings of asset-backed securities to ensure that the risk profile of each security improves or
remains consistent. Prepayments in the ABS portfolio are, in general, insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated to such changes by call protection features. In the event that we are
subject to prepayment risk, we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those asset-backed securities. In addition, we diversify the risks of asset-backed
securities by holding a diverse class of securities, which limits our exposure to any one security.

The
international exposure in our U.S. fixed maturity securities totaled $7,467.8 million, or 19% of total fixed maturity securities, as of December 31, 2005, comprised of
corporate and foreign government fixed maturity securities. Of the $7,467.8 million as of December 31, 2005, investments totaled $2,002.8 million in the United Kingdom,
$1,914.4 million in the continental European Union, $921.3 million in Asia, $675.6 million in Australia, $522.0 million in South America, $335.1 million in Mexico
and $75.0 million in Japan. The remaining $1,021.6 million is invested in 17 other countries. All international fixed maturity securities held by our U.S. operations are either
denominated in U.S. dollars or have been swapped into U.S. dollar equivalents. Our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment professionals. We
control concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks, which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country. Our investment policy limits total international fixed
maturity securities investments to 18% of total statutory general account assets with a 4% limit in emerging markets. Exposure to Canada is not included in our international exposure. As of
December 31, 2005, our investments in Canada totaled $1,483.4 million.

Our
top ten exposures were rated an "A" equivalent or better by the rating agencies as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004, no individual non-government issuer represented more than 1% of U.S. invested assets.

Valuation
techniques for the fixed maturity securities portfolio vary by security type and the availability of market data. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the
amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized, and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results. Interactive Data Corporation ("IDC") or
direct broker quotes are our sources for external prices for our public bonds and those private placement securities that are actively traded in the secondary market. In cases where quoted market
prices are not available, a matrix pricing valuation approach is used. Securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by asset class, sector, rating, and average life. Each pricing category
is assigned a risk spread based on studies of observable public market data or market clearing data from the investment professionals assigned to specific security classes. The expected cash flows of
the security are then discounted back at the current Treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread. Although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the
valuation of an individual security within each pricing category may actually be impacted by company specific factors. Certain market events that could impact the valuation of securities include
issuer credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation, and government actions among others. The resulting prices are then reviewed by pricing analysts. All loans placed on the "watch
list" are valued individually by the investment analysts or the analysts that focus on troubled securities ("Workout Group"). Although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of
those securities, the key assumptions about risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any) and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active
market. To the extent that bonds have longer maturity dates, management's estimate of fair value may involve greater subjectivity since they involve judgment about events well into the future. Every
month, there is a comprehensive review of all impaired securities and problem loans by a group consisting of the Chief Investment Officer, the Portfolio Managers, and the Workout Group. The valuation
of impaired bonds for which there is no quoted price is typically based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received. If the company is likely to continue operations, the
estimate of future cash flows is typically based on the expected operating cash flows of the company that are available to make payments of the bonds. If the company is likely to liquidate, the
estimate of future cash flows is based on an estimate of the liquidation value of its net assets.

The
Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") of the NAIC evaluates most of the fixed maturity securities that we and other U.S. insurance companies hold. The SVO evaluates the bond
investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment categories. The NAIC designations closely mirror the nationally recognized securities rating
organizations' credit ratings for marketable bonds. NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds considered investment grade by such rating organizations. Bonds are considered investment grade when rated
"Baa3" or higher by Moody's, or "BBB-" or higher by Standard & Poor's. NAIC designations 3 through 6 are referred to as below investment grade. Bonds are considered below investment
grade when rated "Ba1" or lower by Moody's, or "BB+" or lower by Standard & Poor's. As of December 31, 2005, the percentage, based on estimated fair value, of total publicly
traded and privately placed fixed maturity securities that were investment grade with an NAIC designation 1 or 2 was 95%.

We
also monitor the credit drift of our corporate fixed maturity securities portfolio. Credit drift is defined as the ratio of the percentage of rating downgrades, including defaults,
divided by the percentage of rating upgrades. We measure credit drift once each fiscal year, assessing the changes in our internally developed credit ratings that have occurred during the year.
Standard & Poor's annual credit ratings drift ratio measures the credit rating change, within
a specific year, of companies that have been assigned ratings by Standard & Poor's. The annual internal credit drift ratio on corporate fixed maturity securities we held in our general account
was a more favorable ratio at 0.56 times compared to the Standard & Poor's drift ratio of 0.78 times, as of December 31, 2005.


The following table presents our total fixed maturity securities by NAIC designation and the equivalent ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of
December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, as well as the percentage, based on estimated fair value, that each designation comprises:

Includes
66 securities with an amortized cost of $637.4 million, gross gains of $12.0 million, gross losses of $3.4 million and a carrying amount of
$646.0 million as of December 31, 2005, that are still pending a review and assignment of a rating by the SVO. Due to the timing of when fixed maturity securities are purchased, legal
documents are filed, and the review by the SVO, there will always be securities in our portfolio that are unrated over a reporting period. In these instances, an equivalent rating is assigned based on
our fixed income analyst's assessment.

We
believe that our long-term fixed maturity securities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded and privately placed securities. Each
year we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturity securities. Our current policy is to limit the percentage of cash flow invested in below investment grade
assets to 7% of cash flow. As of December 31, 2005, we had invested 2.9% of new cash flow for the year in below investment grade assets. While the general account investment returns have
improved due to the below investment grade asset class, we manage its growth strategically by limiting it to 10% of the total fixed maturity securities portfolios.

We
invest in privately placed fixed maturity securities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable
quality public market securities. Generally, private placements provide broader access to management information, strengthened negotiated protective covenants, call protection features and, where
applicable, a higher level of collateral. They are, however, generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets.

We monitor any decline in the credit quality of fixed maturity securities through the designation of "problem securities", "potential problem securities" and
"restructured securities". We define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities: (i) as to which principal and/or interest payments are in default or where default is
perceived to be imminent in the near term, or (ii) issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities. We define potential problem securities in our
fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal "watch list" for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which
may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured. The decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective
judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer. We define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities
where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered. We determine that restructures should occur in those
instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows. If at the time of
restructure, the present value of the new future cash flows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured, a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost basis is
established.

We
have a process in place to identify securities that could potentially have a credit impairment that is other than temporary. This process involves monitoring market events that could
impact issuers' credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions, and other similar factors. This process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels,
downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.

Every
month, a group of individuals including the Chief Investment Officer, our Portfolio Managers, members of our Workout Group, and representatives from Investment Accounting review
all securities where market value is less than seventy-five percent of amortized cost to determine whether losses should be recognized. The analysis focuses on each issuer's ability to
service its debts in a timely fashion and the length of time the security has been trading below cost. Formal documentation of the analysis and the company's decision is prepared and approved by
management.

We
consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether the credit impairment of a security is other than temporary. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include:
(1) the length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events;
and (3) our ability and intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value. To the extent we determine that a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, the
difference between amortized cost and fair value would be charged to earnings.

There
are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring credit impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks
and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our


assessment
of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer, (2) the risk that the economic outlook
will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated
information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to hold
the security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Any of these situations could result in a charge to earnings in a future period.

The
net realized gain relating to other than temporary credit impairments of fixed maturity securities was $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Of the
$74.0 million of realized gains, $52.1 million is due to a recovery related to previously impaired securities received as the result of a litigation settlement with the balance coming as
recoveries on the sales of previously impaired securities. Offsetting this realized gain was $28.6 million of other than temporary credit impaired write-downs. The single largest other than
temporary credit impairment represented less than 0.1% of U.S. fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2005.

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, we realized $62.1 million of gross losses upon disposal of bonds excluding hedging adjustments. Included in this $62.1 million
is $30.8 million related to sales of thirty-nine credit impaired and credit related names. Included in the remaining $31.3 million of losses is an $11.0 million loss
related to a large investment that was called from us in September 2005. We generally intend to hold securities in unrealized loss positions until they mature or recover. However, we do sell
bonds under certain circumstances such as when we have evidence of a significant deterioration in the issuer's creditworthiness, when a change in regulatory requirements modifies what constitutes a
permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. Sales generate both gains and
losses.

Mortgage Loans

Mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. At December 31, 2005, commercial mortgage loans aggregated to
$9,890.7 million. Commercial mortgage loans on real estate are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method, and
net of valuation allowances. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, and reported as mortgage loans in the statements of financial
position.

Commercial
mortgages play an important role in our investment strategy by:

•

providing
strong risk-adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives;

•

enhancing
total returns; and

•

providing
strategic portfolio diversification.

As
a result, we have focused on constructing a solid, high quality portfolio of mortgages. Our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages with conservative
loan-to-value ratios, high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy.

Our
commercial loan portfolio consists of primarily non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties. The mortgage portfolio is comprised of
general-purpose industrial properties, manufacturing office properties and credit oriented retail properties.

California
accounted for 18% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2005. We are, therefore, exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of
catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may affect the region. Like other lenders, we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans. With
respect to California properties, however, we obtain an engineering report specific to each property. The report assesses the building's design specifications, whether it has been upgraded to meet
seismic building codes and the maximum loss that is likely to result from a variety of different seismic events. We also obtain a report that assesses, by building and geographic fault lines, the
amount of loss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio might suffer under a variety of seismic events.

Our
commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified by borrower. As of December 31, 2005, 38% of the U.S. commercial mortgage loan portfolio was comprised of mortgage loans
with principal balances of less than $10.0 million. The total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 was 1,309 and 1,318,
respectively. The average loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was $7.6 million as of December 31, 2005.

We
actively monitor and manage our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Substantially all loans within the portfolio are analyzed regularly and are internally rated, based on a
proprietary risk rating cash flow model, in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets. Based on ongoing monitoring, mortgage loans with a likelihood of becoming delinquent are identified
and placed on an internal "watch list". Among criteria which would indicate a potential problem are: imbalances in ratios of loan to value or contract rents to debt service, major tenant vacancies or
bankruptcies, borrower sponsorship problems, late payments, delinquent taxes and loan relief/restructuring requests.

We
review our mortgage loan portfolio and analyze the need for a valuation allowance for any loan which is delinquent for 60 days or more, in process of foreclosure, restructured,
on the "watch list", or which currently has a valuation allowance. We categorize loans, which are delinquent, loans in process of foreclosure, and loans to borrowers in


bankruptcy
as "problem" loans. Potential problem loans are loans placed on an internal "watch list" for which management has concerns as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan
payment terms and which may result in the loan becoming a problem or being restructured. The decision whether to classify a performing loan as a potential problem involves significant subjective
judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower. We categorize loans for which the original terms of the mortgages have been modified
or for which interest or principal payments have been deferred as "restructured" loans. We also consider matured loans that are refinanced at below market rates as restructured.

The
valuation allowance for commercial mortgage loans includes a loan specific allowance for impaired loans and a provision for losses based on past loss experience believed to be
adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses. The changes in this valuation allowance are reported as a net realized/unrealized capital loss on our consolidated statements of operations.

Commercial
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we determine that a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established or a direct write-down of the loan is recorded for the
difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value. Estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or fair value of the collateral. When a valuation allowance is established, subsequent recoveries are charged to the valuation allowance and
subsequent losses may be charged to the valuation allowance or as a direct write-down of the loan.

The
determination of the calculation and the adequacy of the mortgage loan loss provision based on past experience and mortgage impairments is subjective. Our periodic evaluation and
assessment of the adequacy of the provision for losses and the need for mortgage impairments is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's
ability to repay, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, loss experience and other relevant factors. The current portfolio
statistics and past loss experience produced a provision for the Principal Life general account totaling $30.6 million. The evaluation of our impaired loan component of the allowance is
subjective, as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Our financial position is sensitive to changes in estimated cash flows from
mortgages, the value of the collateral, and changes in the economic
environment in general. Decreases in the valuation allowance aggregated to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $7.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

Problem
commercial mortgages include mortgage loans in foreclosure of $10.4 million as of December 31, 2005. There were no mortgage loans in foreclosure as of
December 31, 2004.

Equity Real Estate

We hold commercial equity real estate as part of our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of
equity real estate investment was $987.7 million and $945.7 million, or 2% and 1%, of U.S. invested assets, respectively. Our commercial equity real estate is held in the form of wholly
owned real estate, real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans, and majority owned interests in real estate joint ventures.

Equity
real estate is categorized as either "real estate held for investment" or "real estate held for sale". Real estate held for investment totaled $853.9 million as of
December 31, 2005, and $809.6 million as of December 31, 2004. The carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Such impairment adjustments are recorded as realized investment losses and accordingly, are reflected in
our consolidated results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, there were no such impairment adjustments.

The
carrying amount of real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, was $133.8 million and $136.1 million, net of valuation
allowances of $4.2 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Once we identify a real estate property to be sold and commence a plan for marketing the property, we classify the property as
held for sale. We establish a valuation allowance subject to periodic revisions, if necessary, to adjust the carrying value of the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the
fair value, less associated selling costs.

We
use research, both internal and external, to recommend appropriate product and geographic allocations and changes to the equity real estate portfolio. We monitor product, geographic
and industry diversification separately and together to determine the most appropriate mix.

Equity
real estate is distributed across geographic regions of the country with larger concentrations in the South Atlantic, Pacific, and West South Central regions of the United States
as of December 31, 2005. By property type, there is a concentration in office buildings and industrial sites that represented approximately 62% of the equity real estate portfolio as of
December 31, 2005.

Other Investments

Our other investments totaled $755.3 million as of December 31, 2005, compared to $1,339.7 million as of December 31, 2004.
Derivatives accounted for $419.3 million in other investments as of December 31, 2005. The remaining invested assets include minority interests in unconsolidated entities and properties
owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners.

International Investment Operations

As of December 31, 2005, our international investment operations consist of the investments of Principal International comprised of $3.1 billion in
invested assets. Principal Global Investors advises each Principal International affiliate on investment policies and strategies that are consistent with the products they offer. Due to the regulatory
constraints in each country, each company maintains its own investment policies. Principal Global Investors employees and international affiliate company credit analysts jointly review each corporate
credit annually.


Overall Composition of International Invested Assets

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk Exposures and Risk Management

Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in
interest rates, although we also have exposures to changes in equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates.

The
active management of market risk is an integral part of our operations. We manage our overall market risk exposure within established risk tolerance ranges by using the following
approaches:

•

rebalance
our existing asset or liability portfolios;

•

control
the risk structure of newly acquired assets and liabilities; or

•

use
derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets or liabilities or assets expected to be purchased.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. One source of interest rate risk is the inherent
difficulty in obtaining assets that mature or have their rate reset at the exact same time as the liabilities they support. Assets may have to be reinvested or sold in the future to meet the liability
cashflows in unknown interest rate environments. Also, there may be timing differences between when new liabilities are priced and when assets are purchased or procured that can cause fluctuations in
profitability if interest rates move materially in the interim. A third source of interest rate risk is the prepayment options embedded within asset and liability contracts that can alter the cash
flow profiles from what was originally expected.

One
of the measures we use to quantify our exposure to interest rate risk is duration. To calculate duration, we project asset and liability cashflows. These cash flows are discounted to
a net present value basis using a spot yield curve, which is a blend of the spot yield curves for each of the asset types in the portfolio. Duration is calculated by re-calculating these
cashflows, re-determining the net present value based upon an alternative level of interest rates, and determining the percentage change in fair value.

We
manage interest rate risks in a number of ways. Differences in durations between assets and liabilities are measured and kept within acceptable tolerances. Derivatives are also
commonly used to mitigate interest rate risk due to cashflow mismatches and timing differences. Prepayment risk is controlled by limiting our exposure to investments that are prepayable without
penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. We also require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk the issuer will exercise such option. Prepayment risk is also
controlled by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised against the company at inopportune times.

Duration-Managed.

Our exposure to interest rate risk stems largely from our substantial holdings of guaranteed fixed rate
liabilities in our U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment. We actively manage the duration of assets and liabilities in these products by minimizing the difference between the two. We have
established a maximum tolerance for this difference and seek to stay within this tolerance.

As
of December 31, 2005, the difference between the asset and liability durations on our primary duration managed portfolio was -.07. This duration gap indicates that,
as of this date, the sensitivity of the fair value of our assets to interest rate movements is less than that of the fair value of our liabilities. Our goal is to minimize the duration gap. Currently,
our guidelines indicate that total duration gaps between the asset and liability portfolios should be within +/-0.25. The value of the assets in this portfolio was
$30,923.7 million as of December 31, 2005.

Duration-Monitored.

For products such as whole life insurance and term life insurance that are less sensitive to interest
rate risk, and for other products such as individual single premium deferred annuities, we manage interest rate risk based on a modeling process that considers the target average life, maturities,
crediting rates and assumptions of policyholder behavior. As of December 31, 2005, the weighted-average difference between the asset and liability durations on these portfolios was
+.63. This duration gap indicates that, as of this date, the sensitivity of the fair value of our assets to interest rate movements is greater than that of the fair value of our
liabilities. We attempt to monitor this duration gap consistent with our overall risk/reward tolerances. The value of the assets in these portfolios was $15,430.6 million as of
December 31, 2005.

Non Duration-Managed.

We also have a block of participating general account pension business that passes most of the actual
investment performance of the assets to the customer. The investment strategy of this block is to maximize investment return to the customer on a "best efforts" basis, and there is little or no
attempt to manage the duration of this portfolio since there is little or no interest rate risk. The value of the assets in these portfolios was $1,625.3 million as of December 31, 2005.


Using
the assumptions and data in effect as of December 31, 2005, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates decreases the net fair value of
our portfolio by approximately $75.6 million. The following table details the estimated changes by risk management strategy. The table also gives the weighted-average duration of the asset
portfolio for each category, and the net duration gap (i.e. the weighted-average difference between the asset and liability durations).

Our selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase or decrease in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario we use to demonstrate potential
risk. While a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase does not represent our view of future market changes, it is a near term reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the
potential impact of such events. While these fair value measurements provide a representation of interest rate sensitivity, they are based on our portfolio exposures at a point in time and may not be
representative of future market results. These exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio transactions in response to new business, management's assessment of changing market conditions
and available investment opportunities.

Debt Issued and Outstanding.

As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate fair value of long-term debt was
$969.5 million. A 100 basis point, immediate, parallel decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $36.2 million. Debt is not recorded at fair value
on the statement of financial position.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk.

We use various derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, total return swaps, mortgage-backed forwards and options. We use interest rate swaps, futures contracts and
mortgage-backed forwards to hedge changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of an insurance liability, such as a guaranteed investment contract, but prior to the purchase of a supporting
asset, or during periods of holding assets in anticipation of near term liability sales. We use interest rate swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and
liabilities. They can be used to change the sensitivity to the interest rate of specific assets and liabilities as well as an entire portfolio. We also use these instruments to hedge the interest rate
exposure in our commercial mortgage-backed securitization operations. Occasionally, we will sell a callable investment-type agreement and will use written interest rate swaptions to
transform the callable liability into a fixed term liability.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk arises from foreign
currency-denominated funding agreements issued to non-qualified institutional investors in the international market, foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities purchased, and
our international operations.

We
estimate that as of December 31, 2005, a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would result in no material
change to the net fair value of our foreign currency denominated instruments identified above, including the currency swap agreements. The selection of a 10% immediate


unfavorable
change in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Foreign Currency Risk.

The foreign currency risk on funding agreements and fixed maturity
securities is eliminated by using currency swaps that swap the foreign currency interest and principal payments to our functional currency. The notional amount of our currency swap agreements
associated with foreign-denominated liabilities as of December 31, 2005, was $2,832.8 million. The notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with foreign-denominated
fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2005, was $997.6 million.

With
regard to our international operations, we attempt to do as much of our business as possible in the functional currency of the country of operation. At times, however, we are unable
to do so, and in these cases, we use foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the resulting risks. As of December 31, 2005, our operations in Chile had currency swaps with a notional amount of
$24.1 million that are used to swap cash flows on U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to a local currency. Chile also utilized currency forwards with a notional amount of $57.4 million in
order to mitigate currency exposure related to U.S. dollar-denominated bonds.

Additionally,
we may take measures to hedge our net equity investments in our foreign subsidiaries from currency risks. As of June 15, 2005, we settled currency forwards used to
hedge a portion of our net equity investment in our Mexican operations from currency fluctuations. We recognized a $2.7 million pre-tax loss on these contracts which is included in
accumulated other comprehensive income. As of November 3, 2005, we settled currency forwards used to hedge a portion of our net equity investment in our Chilean operations from currency
fluctuations.
We recognized a $0.5 million pre-tax gain in other comprehensive income from these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2005. Currently, there are no other outstanding
net equity investment hedges.

Equity Risk

Equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in a particular common stock. As of December 31, 2005, the fair
value of our equity securities was $814.7 million. A 10% decline in the value of the equity securities would result in an unrealized loss of $81.5 million. The selection of a 10%
unfavorable change in the equity markets should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event.

We
also have equity risk associated with (1) fixed deferred annuity products that credit interest to customers based on changes in an external equity index; (2) variable
annuity contracts that have a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB") rider that allows the customer to receive at least the principal deposit back through withdrawals of a specified annual
amount, even if the account value is reduced to zero; and (3) investment-type contracts in which the return is tied to an external equity index.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Equity Risk.

We economically hedge the fixed deferred annuity product by purchasing options that
match the product's profile. We economically hedge the GMWB exposure using futures, options and interest rate swaps. We economically hedge the investment contract exposure using equity call options.

Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest. Our ability to
manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Investments" for
additional information about credit risk.

Use of Derivatives to Diversify or Hedge Credit Risk.

We sometimes purchase credit default swaps to hedge credit exposures in
our investment portfolio. We sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors. If there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the
referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security.

We
have increased our credit exposure through credit default swaps by investing in $42.5 million of subordinated tranches of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation. The
outstanding notional amount as of December 31, 2005 was $480.0 million. We also invested in credit default swaps creating replicated assets with a notional amount of
$687.6 million as of December 31, 2005.

In
addition, on May 26, 2005, we invested $130.0 million in a secured limited recourse credit linked note issued by a grantor trust. The trust entered into a credit default
swap providing credit protection on the first 45% of loss of seven mezzanine tranches totaling $288.9 million of seven synthetic reference portfolios. The risk of loss for the seven referenced
mezzanine tranches begins at 4.85% and ends at 10.85% of loss on each of the seven synthetic reference portfolios. Therefore, defaults in an underlying reference portfolio will only affect the
credit-linked note if cumulative losses exceed 4.85% of a synthetic reference portfolio. As of December 31, 2005, the credit default swap entered into by the trust had an outstanding notional
amount of $130.0 million. The creditors of the grantor trusts have no recourse to the assets of our company.


Derivative Summary

Notional amounts are used to express the extent of our involvement in derivative transactions and represent a standard measurement of the volume of our derivative
activity. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate
contractual flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for contracts such as currency swaps. Actual credit exposure represents the amount owed to us under derivative contracts as of
the valuation date. The following tables present our position in, and credit exposure to, derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004.

Counterparty Risk

In conjunction with our use of derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty risk, or the risk that the counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative
contract. We actively manage this risk by:

•

establishing
exposure limits which take into account non-derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure;

•

performing
similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long-term basis;

•

diversifying
our risk across numerous approved counterparties;

•

limiting
exposure to A+ credit or better;

•

conducting
stress-test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction;

•

implementing
credit support annex (collateral) agreements with selected counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures; and

•

daily
monitoring of counterparty credit ratings.

All
new derivative counterparties are approved by the Investment Committee. We believe the risk of incurring losses due to nonperformance by our counterparties is manageable.

Effects of Inflation

We do not believe that inflation, in the United States or in the other countries in which we operate, has had a material effect on our consolidated operations
over the past five years. In the future, however, we may be affected by inflation to the extent it causes interest rates to rise.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("the
Company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("the COSO criteria"). Management of Principal Financial Group, Inc. is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Principal Financial Group, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Principal Financial Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of
Principal Financial Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2005, of Principal Financial Group, Inc. and our report dated February 16, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("the Company") as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Principal Financial Group, Inc. at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in response to new accounting standards, the Company changed its methods of accounting for variable interest
entities effective July 1, 2003, certain fixed and variable contract features effective January 1, 2004, and certain non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets
(primarily real estate) effective July 1, 2005.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2005

1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Principal Financial Group, Inc., ("the Company") along with its consolidated subsidiaries is a diversified financial services organization engaged in
promoting retirement savings and investment and insurance products and services in the U.S. and selected international markets.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which include our majority-owned subsidiaries and, subsequent to June 30, 2003, consolidated variable
interest entities ("VIEs"), have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). Less than majority-owned entities in which we had at least a 20%
interest and LLCs, partnerships and real estate joint ventures in which we had at least a 5% interest, are reported on the equity basis in the consolidated statements of financial position as other
investments. Investments in LLCs, partnerships and real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership percentage of 3% to 5% will be based on the facts and circumstances to determine if equity
or cost method will be applied. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Closed Block

Principal Life Insurance Company ("Principal Life") operates a closed block ("Closed Block") for the benefit of individual participating dividend-paying policies
in force at the time of the 1998 mutual insurance holding company ("MIHC") formation. See Note 8, Closed Block, for further details.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported and disclosed. These estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On September 19, 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee ("AcSEC") issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises
for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts

. AcSEC defines
an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a
contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. An internal replacement that is determined to result in a replacement contract that is substantially unchanged from the
replaced contract should be accounted for as a continuation of the replaced contract. Contract modifications resulting in a replacement contract that is substantially changed from the replaced
contract should be accounted for as an
extinguishment of the replaced contract and any unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs, unearned revenue liabilities, and deferred sales inducement costs from the replaced contract should be
written off and acquisition costs on the new contracts capitalized as appropriate. This SOP is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.
We are still evaluating the impact this guidance will have to our consolidated financial statements.

On
May 30, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion
No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3

("SFAS 154"), which changes
the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Under SFAS 154, a change in accounting principle should be retrospectively applied to all prior periods,
unless it is impracticable to do so. This retrospective application requirement replaces the Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 20,

Accounting
Changes

("APB 20"), requirement to recognize changes in accounting principle by including the cumulative effect of the change in net income during the current period.
SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles where we are changing to a more preferable accounting method, as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement
that does not contain specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 carries forward without change the guidance contained in APB 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously
issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes on or after January 1, 2006. SFAS 154 does not change the transition
provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

On
December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earning
Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

("FSP 109-2"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was enacted on
October 22, 2004, and introduces, among other things, a special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer
("repatriation provision"), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109-2 was issued to allow additional time for companies to determine whether any foreign earnings will be
repatriated under the Act's repatriation provision, given the law was enacted late in the year and certain provisions were unclear. Under FSP 109-2, companies that took the
additional time were required to provide disclosures about the status of the company's evaluation and the potential effects of its decision. FSP 109-2 was effective for the year
ended December 31, 2004. See Note 12, Income Taxes, for further details.

On
December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

("SFAS 123R").
SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements. SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

("SFAS 123"), supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees

("APB 25"), and SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure — an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

. On April 14,
2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") approved a new rule delaying the effective date of SFAS 123R to annual periods that begin after June 15, 2005.
Accordingly, we will be adopting SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. This Statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements as we began expensing all stock options using a fair-value based method effective for the year beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, any stock options granted prior to
January 1, 2002 are fully vested. We applied the prospective method of transition as prescribed by SFAS 123 when we elected to begin expensing stock-based compensation in 2002.

In
May 2005, we learned of discussions between several major accounting firms, the FASB and the SEC concluding it is appropriate to recognize compensation cost either immediately
for stock awards granted to retirement eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if retirement eligibility is expected to occur during
the nominal vesting period. Our approach has been to follow the widespread practice of recognizing compensation cost over the explicit service period (up to the date of actual retirement). For any
awards that are granted after we adopt SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, we will recognize compensation cost through the period that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no
longer required to provide service to
earn the award. If we had applied the nonsubstantive vesting provisions of SFAS 123R to awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, our consolidated financial statements would not have been
materially impacted.

In
December, 2004, SFAS No. 153,

Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

("SFAS 153"), was
issued. APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

("APB 29"), provided the basic principle that exchanges of
nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. However, APB 29 provided an exception that allowed certain exchanges of similar productive assets to be
recorded at book value. SFAS 153 amends APB 29 to eliminate this exception and requires non-monetary exchanges that meet certain criteria to be accounted for at fair value. We
adopted SFAS 153 and are applying its guidelines to nonmonetary exchanges occurring on or after July 1, 2005.

On
March 9, 2004, the SEC Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No.105,

Application of Accounting Principles to Loan
Commitments

("SAB 105"), in which the SEC Staff expressed their view that the fair value of recorded loan commitments, including interest rate lock commitments
("IRLCs"), that are required to follow derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

("SFAS 133"), should not consider the expected future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan. We record IRLCs at zero value at date of issuance with subsequent gains or
losses measured by changes in market interest rates. Therefore, this SAB did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

On
July 7, 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 03-1,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts

("SOP 03-1"). This SOP addresses an insurance
enterprise's accounting for certain fixed and variable contract features not covered by other authoritative accounting guidance. We adopted SOP 03-1 effective January 1,
2004, and recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of $(5.7) million, which is net of income tax benefits of $3.0 million. The accounting change impacted our Life and Health
Insurance, U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation and International Asset Management and Accumulation segments.

SOP 03-1
addresses the classification of contracts and calculation of an additional liability for contracts that contain significant insurance features. The adoption
of the guidance required the recognition of an additional liability in cases where the insurance benefit feature resulted in gains in early years followed by losses in later years. The accrual and


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

release
of the additional liability also impacted the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DPAC"). As of January 1, 2004, we increased future policyholder benefits due to our no
lapse guarantee feature of our universal life and variable universal life products within our Life and Health Insurance segment and for variable annuities with guaranteed minimum death benefits in our
U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment. This resulted in an after-tax cumulative effect of $(0.9) million in the Life and Health Insurance segment and
$(1.5) million in the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment.

SOP 03-1
also requires contracts which provide for potential benefits in addition to the account balance that are payable only upon annuitization to establish an
additional liability if the present value of the annuitized benefits exceeds the expected account balance at the expected annuitization date. In that regard, we also had an after-tax
cumulative effect related to an equity method investment within our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment of $(3.3) million, net of income taxes, as of January 1, 2004,
for select deferred annuity products, which include guaranteed annuitization purchase rates.

In
addition, the guidance clarifies the accounting and classification for sales inducements. Although the valuation impacts were immaterial, we reclassified $30.3 million of sales
inducements from DPAC to other assets as of January 1, 2004.

The
FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

("FIN 46"), in January 2003.
FIN 46 applies to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entities to
finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise, known as the primary beneficiary,
absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
entity.

The
guidance was effective immediately for all VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and effective July 1, 2003, for all VIEs created before February 1, 2003. We
invested in one VIE in April, 2003, and effective July 1, 2003, consolidated VIEs created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, for which we are the primary beneficiary. At
July 1, 2003, our consolidated financial statements were adjusted to record a cumulative effect of adopting FIN 46, as follows:

See
Note 4, Variable Interest Entities, for the disclosures relating to VIEs.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt issues with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased.

Investments

We classify our fixed maturity and equity investments into one of two categories:, available-for-sale or trading. We determine the
appropriate classification of fixed maturity securities at the time of purchase. Fixed maturity securities include bonds, mortgage-backed securities and redeemable preferred stock. We classify fixed
maturity securities as either available-for-sale or trading and, accordingly, carry them at fair value. (See Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for policies
related to the determination of fair value.) Unrealized gains and losses related to available-for-sale securities are reflected in stockholders' equity, net of related DPAC,
sales inducements, unearned revenue reserves, policyholder dividend obligation ("PDO"), and applicable income taxes. Unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are reflected in net
income as net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses).

The
cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, both computed using the interest method. The cost of fixed maturity securities is
adjusted for declines in value that are other than temporary. Impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary are reported in net income as a component of net realized/unrealized capital gains
(losses). For loan-backed and structured securities, we recognize income using a

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

constant
effective yield based on currently anticipated prepayments using a tool which models the prepayment behavior of the underlying collateral based on the current interest rate environment.

Equity
securities include mutual funds, common stock and nonredeemable preferred stock. The cost of equity securities is adjusted for declines in value that are other than temporary.
Impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary are reported in net income as a component of net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). Equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale or trading and, accordingly, are carried at fair value. (See Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for policies related to the determination
of fair value.) Unrealized gains and losses related to available-for-sale securities are reflected in stockholders' equity, net of related DPAC, sales inducements, unearned
revenue reserves, PDO, and applicable income taxes. Unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are reflected in net income as net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses).

Real
estate investments are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. The initial cost bases of properties acquired through loan foreclosures are the lower of the fair market
values of the properties at the time of foreclosure or the outstanding loan balance. Buildings and land improvements are generally depreciated on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of improvements, and tenant improvement costs are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of the related lease. We recognize impairment losses for
properties when indicators of impairment are present and a property's expected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the property's carrying value. In such cases, the cost bases of the
properties are reduced to fair value. Real estate expected to be disposed is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with valuation allowances established accordingly and
depreciation no longer recognized. Any impairment losses and any changes in valuation allowances are reported in net income.

Commercial
and residential mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method, net of
valuation allowances, and direct write-downs for impairment. Any changes in the valuation allowances are reported in net income as net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). We measure impairment
based upon the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate or the loan's observable market price. If foreclosure is probable, the measurement of any valuation allowance is based upon the fair value of the collateral. We have commercial
mortgage loans held-for-sale in the amount of $412.1 million and $478.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which are carried at lower of
cost or fair value, less cost to sell, and reported as mortgage loans in the statements of financial position.

Net
realized capital gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on the basis of specific identification. In general, in addition to realized capital gains and losses on
investment sales, unrealized gains and losses related to other than temporary impairments, trading securities, certain seed money investments, fair value hedge ineffectiveness, derivatives not
designated as hedges and changes in the mortgage loan allowance are reported in net income as net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). Investment gains and losses on sales of certain real
estate held-for-sale, which do not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation, are reported as net investment income and are excluded from net
realized/unrealized capital gains (losses).

Policy
loans and other investments, excluding investments in unconsolidated entities, are primarily reported at cost.

Securitizations

We, along with other contributors, sell commercial mortgage loans to trusts that, in turn, securitize the assets. We retain primary servicing responsibilities and
may retain other immaterial interests. We receive annual servicing fees approximating 0.01% of the assets we are servicing, which approximates cost. The investors and the securitization entities have
no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The value of our retained interests is subject primarily to credit risk.

As
these trusts are classified as qualifying special purpose entities ("QSPE") pursuant to the guidance of SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities — A Replacement of FASB Statement 125

("SFAS 140"), we recognize the gain on
the sale of the loans to the trust and the trusts are not required to be consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46. There is significant judgment used to determine whether a trust is a QSPE.
To maintain QSPE status, the trust must continue to meet the QSPE criteria both initially and in subsequent periods. We have analyzed the governing pooling and servicing agreements for each of our
securitizations and believe that the terms are industry standard and are consistent with the QSPE criteria. If at any time we determine a trust no longer qualifies as a QSPE, each trust will need to
be reviewed to determine if there is a need to recognize the commercial mortgage loan asset in the statement of financial position along with the offsetting liability. In addition, certain industry
practices related to the qualifying status of QSPE's are being discussed by regulators and standard setters and could impact the accounting for existing and future transactions.

Derivatives

Overview.

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivatives generally used by us include interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, currency swaps, currency forwards, credit default
swaps, total return swaps, interest rate lock commitments, bond forwards, mortgage-backed forwards and options. Derivatives may be exchange traded or contracted in the
over-the-counter market. Derivative positions are either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position and are measured at fair value, generally by
obtaining quoted market prices or through the use of pricing models. Fair values can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, values of securities, credit
spreads, and market volatility and liquidity.

Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation.

We designate derivatives as either:

(a)

a
hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, including those denominated in a foreign currency ("fair
value" hedge);

(b)

a
hedge of a forecasted transaction or the exposure to variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability, including those denominated in a
foreign currency ("cash flow" hedge);

(c)

a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or

(d)

a
derivative not designated as a hedging instrument.

Our
accounting for the ongoing changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the designation,as described above, and is determined when the
derivative contract is entered into or at the time of redesignation under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

("SFAS 133"). Hedge accounting is used for derivatives that are specifically designated in advance as hedges and that reduce our exposure to an indicated risk
by having a high correlation between changes in the value of the derivatives and the items being hedged at both the inception of the hedge and throughout the hedge period.

Fair Value Hedges.

When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is determined to be
highly effective, changes in its fair value, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk, are reported in net
realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). Any difference between the net change in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item represents hedge ineffectiveness.

Cash Flow Hedges.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is determined to be highly
effective, changes in its fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in net income. At the time the variability of cash
flows being hedged impact net income, the related portion of deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument is reclassified and reported in net income.

Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Hedges.

When a derivative is used as a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation, its change in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, is recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in net income. If the foreign operation is sold or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation, the deferred gains or
losses on the derivative instrument are reclassified into net income.

Non-Hedge Derivatives.

If a derivative does not qualify or is not designated for hedge
accounting, all changes in fair value are reported in net income without considering the changes in the fair value of the economically associated assets or liabilities.

In
our commercial mortgage backed securitization operation, we enter into commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans at specified interest rates and other applicable terms within
specified periods of time. These commitments are legally binding agreements to extend credit to a counterparty. Loan commitments that will be held for sale are recognized as derivatives and are
recorded at fair value.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing.

We formally document all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes associating all derivatives designated as fair
value or cash flow hedges with specific assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position or with specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Effectiveness of the hedge is
formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Even if a derivative is highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, the hedge might have some
ineffectiveness.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

We
use qualitative and quantitative methods to assess hedge effectiveness. Qualitative methods may include monitoring changes to terms and conditions and counterparty credit ratings.
Quantitative methods may include statistical tests including regression analysis and minimum variance and dollar offset techniques. If we determine a derivative is no longer highly effective as a
hedge, we prospectively discontinue hedge accounting.

Termination of Hedge Accounting.

We prospectively discontinue hedge accounting when (1) the
criteria to qualify for hedge accounting is no longer met, e.g., a derivative is determined to no longer be highly effective in offsetting the change in fair value or cash flows of a hedged item;
(2) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated or exercised; or (3) we remove the designation of the derivative being the hedging instrument for a fair value or cash flow hedge.

If
it is determined that a derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried on the statement of financial position at its fair value, with
changes in fair value recognized currently in net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). The asset or liability under a fair value hedge will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value and
the existing basis adjustment is amortized to the income statement line associated with the asset or liability. The component of other comprehensive income related to discontinued cash flow hedges
that are no longer highly effective is amortized to the statement of operations consistent with the net income impacts of the original hedged cash flows. If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because a
hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the deferred gain or loss is immediately reclassified from other comprehensive income into net income.

Embedded Derivatives.

We purchase and issue financial instruments and products that contain a
derivative that is embedded in the financial instrument or product. We assess whether this embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the asset or liability that serves as its host
contract. If we deem that the embedded derivatives terms are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a
derivative instrument, the derivative is bifurcated from that contract and held at fair value on the statement of financial position, with changes in fair value reported in net income.

Contractholder and Policyholder Liabilities

Contractholder and policyholder liabilities (contractholder funds, future policy benefits and claims and other policyholder funds) include reserves for investment
contracts and reserves for universal life, limited payment, participating, traditional and group life insurance, accident and health insurance and disability income policies, as well as a provision
for dividends on participating policies. Investment contracts are contractholders' funds on deposit with us and generally include reserves for pension and annuity contracts. Reserves on investment
contracts are equal to the cumulative deposits less any applicable charges plus credited interest. Reserves for universal life insurance contracts are equal to cumulative deposits less charges plus
credited interest, which represents the account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders.

For
our universal life and annuity products we hold additional reserves pursuant to SOP 03-1. SOP 03-1 requires that reserves be held on certain
long duration contracts where benefit features result in gains in early years followed by losses in later years, universal life/variable universal life contracts that contain no lapse guarantee
features, or annuities with guaranteed minimum death benefits.

Reserves
for nonparticipating term life insurance and disability income contracts are computed on a basis of assumed investment yield, mortality, morbidity and expenses, including a
provision for adverse deviation, which generally varies by plan, year of issue and policy duration. Investment yield is based on our experience. Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rate assumptions
are based on our experience and are periodically reviewed against both industry standards and experience.

Reserves
for participating life insurance contracts are based on the net level premium reserve for death and endowment policy benefits. This net level premium reserve is calculated based
on dividend fund interest rates and mortality rates guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in the contract.

Participating
business represented approximately 24%, 28% and 32% of our life insurance in force and 62%, 64% and 67% of the number of life insurance policies in force at
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Participating business represented approximately 58%, 60% and 65% of life insurance premiums for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. The amount of dividends to policyholders is approved annually by Principal Life's Board of Directors. The amount of dividends to be paid to policyholders is determined after
consideration of several factors including interest, mortality, morbidity and other expense experience for the year and judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by
Principal Life. At the end of the reporting period, Principal Life


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

establishes
a dividend liability for the pro rata portion of the dividends expected to be paid on or before the next policy anniversary date.

Some
of our policies and contracts require payment of fees in advance for services that will be rendered over the estimated lives of the policies and contracts. These payments are
established as unearned revenue reserves upon receipt and included in other policyholder funds in the consolidated statements of financial position. These unearned
revenue reserves are amortized to operations over the estimated lives of these policies and contracts in relation to the emergence of estimated gross profit margins.

The
liability for unpaid accident and health claims is an estimate of the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported losses not yet settled. This liability is estimated using actuarial
analyses and case basis evaluations. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, we believe that the liability for unpaid claims is adequate. These estimates are continually
reviewed and, as adjustments to this liability become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in current operations.

Recognition of Premiums and Other Considerations, Fees and Other Revenues and Benefits

Traditional individual life insurance products include those products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits and consist principally of whole life and
term life insurance policies. Premiums from these products are recognized as premium revenue when due. Related policy benefits and expenses for individual life and annuity products are associated with
earned premiums and result in the recognition of profits over the expected term of the policies and contracts.

Immediate
annuities with life contingencies include products with fixed and guaranteed annuity considerations and benefits and consist principally of group and individual single premium
annuities with life contingencies. Under the guidance for limited payment contracts under SFAS No. 97,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments,

which refers back to SFAS No. 60,

Accounting
and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises

("SFAS 60"), annuity considerations from these products are recognized as revenue. However, the collection of these annuity
considerations does not represent the completion of the earnings process, as we establish annuity reserves, using estimates for mortality and investment assumptions, which include provision for
adverse deviation as defined in SFAS 60. We anticipate profits to emerge over the life of the annuity products as we earn investment income, pay benefits and release reserves.

Group
life and health insurance premiums are generally recorded as premium revenue over the term of the coverage. Certain group contracts contain experience premium refund provisions
based on a pre-defined formula that reflects their claim experience. Experience premium refunds are recognized over the term of the coverage and adjusted to reflect current experience.
Fees for contracts providing claim processing or other administrative services are recorded over the period the service is provided. Related policy benefits and expenses for group life and health
insurance products are associated with earned premiums and result in the recognition of profits over the term of the policies and contracts.

Universal
life-type policies are insurance contracts with terms that are not fixed and guaranteed. Amounts received as payments for such contracts are not reported as premium
revenues. Revenues for universal life-type insurance contracts consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy initiation and administration, surrender charges and other fees
that have been assessed against policy account values. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include interest credited to contracts and benefit claims incurred in the period in excess
of related policy account balances.

Investment
contracts do not subject us to significant risks arising from policyholder mortality or morbidity and consist primarily of Guaranteed Investment Contracts ("GICs"), funding
agreements and certain deferred annuities. Amounts received as payments for investment contracts are established as investment contract liability balances and are not reported as premium revenues.
Revenues for investment contracts consist of investment income and policy administration charges. Investment contract benefits that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period
in excess of related investment contract liability balances and interest credited to investment contract liability balances.

Fees
and other revenues are earned for asset management services provided to retail and institutional clients based largely upon contractual rates applied to the market value of the
client's portfolio. Additionally, fees and other revenues are earned for administrative services performed including recordkeeping and reporting services for retirement savings plans. Fees and other
revenues received for performance of asset management and administrative services are recognized as revenue when the service is performed or earned.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

Commissions and other costs (underwriting, issuance and agency expenses) that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance
policies and investment contract business are capitalized to the extent recoverable. Maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to operations as incurred.

DPAC
for universal life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and investment contracts are being amortized over the lives of the policies and
contracts in relation to the emergence of estimated gross profit margins. For investment contracts pertaining to individual and group annuities which have separate account investment options, we
utilize a mean reversion method (reversion to the mean assumption), a common industry practice, to determine the future domestic equity market growth assumption used for the amortization of DPAC. This
amortization is adjusted in the current period when estimates of estimated gross profit are revised. The DPAC of nonparticipating term life insurance policies are being amortized over the
premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policyholder liabilities.

DPAC
are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing at the end of each accounting period. If loss recognition is necessary, DPAC would be
written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profits are not adequate to cover related losses and expenses.

Reinsurance

We enter into reinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal course of business. We may assume reinsurance from or cede reinsurance to other companies.
Assets and liabilities related to reinsurance ceded are reported on a gross basis. Premiums and expenses are reported net of reinsurance ceded, except for the medical reinsurance agreement, which is
accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. Our medical reinsurance agreement is no longer in effect after December 31, 2004, as we did not renew. We are contingently liable with
respect to reinsurance ceded to other companies in the event the reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations it has assumed. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, we had reinsured
$21.2 billion, $20.1 billion and $19.4 billion of life insurance in force, representing 14% of total net life insurance in force through a single third-party reinsurer. To
minimize the possibility of losses, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk.

The
effects of reinsurance on premiums and other considerations and policy and contract benefits were as follows:

Separate Accounts

The separate account assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements represent the fair market value of funds that are separately
administered by us for contracts with equity, real estate and fixed-income investments. Generally, the separate account contract owner, rather than us, bears the investment risk of these funds. The
separate account assets are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any of our other business. We receive fees for mortality, withdrawal, and expense risks, as well as
administrative, maintenance and investment advisory services, that are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Net deposits, net investment income and realized


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

and
unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the separate accounts include a separate account valued at $726.6 million and $782.8 million, respectively, which primarily includes
shares of our stock that were allocated and issued to eligible participants of qualified employee benefit plans administered by us as part of the policy credits issued under our 2001 demutualization.
These shares are included in both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. The separate account shares are recorded at fair value and are reported as separate account assets and separate
account liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Changes in fair value of the separate account shares are reflected in both the separate account assets and separate account
liabilities and does not impact our results of operations.

Income Taxes

We file a U.S. consolidated income tax return that includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries. Our policy of allocating income tax expenses and benefits to
companies in the group is generally based upon pro rata contribution of taxable income or operating losses. We are taxed at corporate rates on taxable income based on existing tax laws. Current income
taxes are charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred income taxes are provided for the
tax effect of temporary differences in the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating losses using enacted income tax rates and laws. The effect on deferred
income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period in which the change is enacted.

Foreign Exchange

Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates denominated in non-U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the
year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of stockholders' equity, along with any related hedge and tax effects. Revenues and
expenses for these entities are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. Revenue, expense and other foreign currency transaction and translation adjustments for foreign
subsidiaries and affiliates with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency that affect cash flows are reported in current operations, along with related hedge and tax effects.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Goodwill and other intangibles include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets recorded in connection with
acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at one level below our operating
segments on an annual basis during the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing for
indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.

Intangible
assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis generally over a period of 5 to 30 years and are reviewed periodically for
indicators of impairment in value. If facts and circumstances suggest possible impairment, the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is
compared to the current carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of
assets over their fair value.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for
the period and excludes the dilutive effect of stock options. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities, such as options and
non-vested stock grants, were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.

Stock-Based Compensation

At December 31, 2005, we have several stock-based compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 19, Stock-Based Compensation Plans. We
apply the fair value method to all stock-based awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2002. For stock-based awards granted prior to this date, we used the intrinsic value method.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

Awards
under our plans vest over periods ranging from one year to three years. Therefore, the cost related to stock-based compensation included in the determination of net income for
2004 and 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the inception of our stock-based compensation plans. Had
compensation expense for our stock option awards and employees' purchase rights been determined based upon fair values at the grant dates for awards under the plans in accordance with SFAS 123,
our net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below. For the purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized
to expense over the options' vesting period.

Real Estate Investments

In second and third quarter 2005, we sold certain real estate properties previously held for investment purposes. These properties qualify for discontinued
operations treatment under SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

("SFAS 144").
Therefore, the results of operations have been removed from our results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The gains on disposal are reported as other after-tax
adjustments in our Corporate and Other segment. All assets, including cash, and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been reclassified to separate discontinued asset and liability line
items on the consolidated statements of financial position. We have separately disclosed the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to our

Principal International Argentina S.A.

On July 2, 2004, we closed the sale of Principal International Argentina S.A. ("PI Argentina"), our subsidiary in Argentina, and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Principal Life Compañía de Seguros, S.A. and Principal Retiro Compañía de Seguros de Retiro, S.A. Our
total after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately U.S. $29.2 million.

The
decision to sell PI Argentina was made with a view toward focusing our resources, executing in core strategic priorities and markets and meeting stockholders expectations. Changing
market dynamics since the 2001 economic crisis in Argentina led us to conclude that the interests of Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s stockholders would best be served by our exit of this
market.

PI
Argentina qualifies for discontinued operations treatment under SFAS 144, therefore, the results of operations have been removed from our results of continuing operations and
segment operating earnings for all periods presented. All assets, including cash, and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been reclassified to separate discontinued asset and liability
line items on the consolidated statements of financial position. We have separately disclosed the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued
operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, the information included in the notes to the financial statements excludes information applicable to PI Argentina, unless
otherwise noted.

Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc.

On July 1, 2004, we closed the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. to CitiMortgage, Inc. Our total after-tax proceeds
from the sale were approximately $620.0 million. Our Mortgage Banking segment, which included Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., is accounted for as a discontinued operation under
SFAS 144, and therefore, the results of operations (excluding corporate overhead) have been removed from our results of continuing operations and segment operating earnings for all periods
presented. All assets, including cash, and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been reclassified to separate discontinued asset and liability line items on the consolidated statements of
financial position. We have separately disclosed the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of cash
flows. Corporate overhead allocated to our Mortgage Banking segment does not qualify for discontinued operations treatment under SFAS 144 and is included in our results of continuing operations
and segment operating earnings for all periods prior to July 1, 2004. Additionally, the information included in the notes to the financial statements excludes information applicable to
Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., unless otherwise noted.

The
decision to sell Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. was made with a view toward intensifying our strategic focus on our core retirement and risk protection business as well
as achieving our longer-term financial objectives. In addition, the sale was also viewed as a positive move for our stockholders as we go forward from an improved capital position, with
better financial flexibility and greater stability of earnings.

The
2004 summary results of operations information is for the six months ended prior to the July 1, 2004, sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. and, accordingly,
there is no statement of operations data to present subsequent to the date of the sale.

Our
U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment held residential mortgage banking escrow deposits (reported as other liabilities) as of December 31, 2003. The purchaser (or
acquirer) closed out the banking escrow deposit accounts as a result of the sale. U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation total revenues from this arrangement reclassified to discontinued
operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $(5.6) million, and $28.6 million, respectively. Income (loss) from discontinued operations net of related income
taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003 were $(3.5) million, and $11.2 million, respectively.

BT Financial Group

On October 31, 2002, we sold substantially all of BT Financial Group to Westpac Banking Corporation ("Westpac"). As of December 31, 2005, we have
received proceeds of A$958.9 million Australian dollars ("A$") (U.S. $537.4 million) from Westpac. Our total after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately U.S.
$900.0 million. This
amount includes cash proceeds from Westpac, tax benefits and a gain from unwinding the hedged asset associated with our investment in BT Financial Group.

The
decision to sell BT Financial Group was made with a view toward focusing our resources, executing on core strategic priorities and meeting stockholder expectations. Changing market
dynamics since our acquisition of BT Financial Group, including industry consolidation, led us to conclude that the interests of BT Financial Group clients and staff would be best served under
Westpac's ownership.

Refinements
to the estimated loss, reported as discontinued operations, resulted in an increase to net income of $8.4 million and $21.8 million in 2005 and 2003,
respectively.

4.    Variable Interest Entities

We have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and other entities where we have a variable interest. The following serves as a discussion of
investments in entities that meet the definition of a VIE under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

("FIN 46R").

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation.

On May 26, 2005, we invested $130.0 million
in a secured limited recourse credit linked note issued by a grantor trust. The trust entered into a credit default swap providing credit protection on the first 45% of loss of seven mezzanine
tranches totaling $288.9 million of seven synthetic reference portfolios. Our risk of loss for the seven referenced mezzanine tranches begins at 4.85% and ends at 10.85% of loss on each of the
seven


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

4.    Variable Interest Entities — (continued)

synthetic
reference portfolios. Therefore, defaults in an underlying reference portfolio will only affect the credit-linked note if cumulative losses exceed 4.85% of a synthetic reference portfolio.

We
have determined that this grantor trust is a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary of the trust due to our sole interest in the variable interest entity and
management of the synthetic reference portfolios. Upon consolidation of the trust, as of December 31, 2005, our consolidated statements of financial position include $130.0 million of
available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, which represent the
collateral held by the trust. As of December 31, 2005, the credit default swap entered into by the trust has an outstanding notional amount of $130.0 million and a change in fair value
of a $0.4 million pre-tax loss that is recorded in net income and is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position as an other liability. The creditors of the
grantor trusts have no recourse to the assets of our company.

Grantor Trusts.

We contributed undated subordinated floating rate notes to three grantor trusts. The
trusts separated the cash flows of the underlying notes by issuing an interest-only certificate and a residual certificate related to each note contributed. Each interest-only
certificate entitles the holder to interest on the stated note for a specified term while the residual certificate entitles the holder to interest payments subsequent to the term of the
interest-only certificate and to all principal payments. We retained the interest-only certificate and the residual certificates were subsequently sold to a third party.

We
have determined that these grantor trusts are VIEs as, in the event of a default or prepayment on the underlying notes, which is the main risk of loss, our interest-only
certificates are exposed to the majority of the risk of loss. The restricted interest periods end between 2016 and 2020 and, at that time, the residual certificate holders' certificates are redeemed
by the trust in return for the notes. We have determined that it will be necessary for us to consolidate these entities until the expiration of the interest-only period. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, our consolidated statements of financial position include $364.1 million and $369.8 million, respectively, of undated subordinated floating rate notes
of the grantor trusts, which are classified as available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and represent the collateral held by the trust. The obligation to deliver the
underlying securities to the residual certificate holders of $147.4 million and $138.1 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, is classified as an other liability
and contains an embedded derivative of the forecasted transaction to deliver the underlying securities. The creditors of the grantor trusts have no recourse to the assets of our company.

Other.

In addition to the entities above, we have a number of relationships with a disparate group of
entities, which meet the FIN 46R criteria for VIEs. Due to the nature of our direct investment in the equity and/or debt of these VIEs, we are the primary beneficiary of such entities, which requires
us to consolidate them. These entities include three financial services companies, two private investment trusts, a hedge fund and real estate joint venture. The consolidation of these VIEs did not
have a material effect on either our consolidated statement of financial position or results of operations as of December 31, 2005 or 2004 and for any of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005. For the majority of these entities, the creditors have no recourse to the assets of our company.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, these entities had long-term debt of $123.9 million and $186.8 million, respectively, of which $110.6 million
and $114.7 million, respectively, was issued by our affiliates and, therefore, eliminated upon consolidation.

Significant Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

We hold a significant variable interest in a number of VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. These entities include private investment trusts and
custodial relationships that have issued trust certificates or custodial receipts that are recorded as available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in the consolidated
financial statements.

Between
October 3, 1996 and September 21, 2001, we entered into seven separate but similar transactions where various third parties transferred funds to either a custodial
account or a trust. The custodians or trusts purchased shares of specific money market funds and then separated the cash flows of the money market shares into share receipts and dividend receipts. The
dividend receipts entitle the holder to dividends paid for a specified term while the share receipts, purchased at a discount, entitle the holder to dividend payments subsequent to the term of the
dividend receipts and the rights to the underlying shares. We have purchased the share receipts. After the restricted
dividend period ends between 2017 and 2021, we, as the share receipt holder, have the right to terminate the custodial account or trust agreement and will receive the underlying money market fund
shares. Upon adoption of FIN 46R, we determined the primary beneficiary is the dividend receipt holder, which has the majority of the risk of loss. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of
our involvement with these entities is our recorded investment of $224.5 million and $203.1 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

On
June 20, 1997, we entered into a transaction in which we purchased a residual trust certificate. The trust separated the cash flows of an underlying security into an
interest-only certificate that entitles the third party certificate holder to the stated interest on the underlying security through May 15, 2017, and into a residual certificate
entitling the holder to interest payments subsequent to the term of the interest-only certificates and any principal payments. Subsequent to the restricted interest period, we, as the
residual certificate holder, have the right to terminate the trust agreement and will receive the underlying security. Upon adoption of FIN 46R, we determined the primary beneficiary is the
interest-only certificate holder, which has the majority of the risk of loss. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this entity is our recorded investment of
$77.0 million and $68.9 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

We
recognize impairment losses for fixed maturities and equity securities when declines in value are other than temporary. Gross realized losses related to other than temporary
impairments of fixed maturity securities were $28.6 million, $60.6 million and $173.7 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. We also recognized gross realized losses as
the result of credit triggered sales of $30.8 million, $18.9 million and $42.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Gross losses recorded on fixed maturity securities
that were part of fair value hedging relationships totaled $64.0 million, $16.8 million and $64.7 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively.

As
of December 31, 2005, we held $13,163.6 million in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses of $256.2 million.
Of these amounts, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio represented $12,822.1 million in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses of
$243.0 million. Principal Life's consolidated portfolio consists of fixed maturity securities where 97% are investment grade (rated AAA through BBB-) with an average price of 98
(carrying value/amortized cost).

For
those securities that have been in a loss position for less than twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio holds 1,199 securities with a carrying value of
$10,550.8 million and unrealized losses of $177.1 million reflecting an average price of 98. Of this portfolio, 97% was investment grade (rated AAA through BBB-) at
December 31, 2005, with associated unrealized losses of $167.1 million. The losses on these securities can primarily be attributed to changes in market interest rates and changes in

As
of December 31, 2004, we held $5,668.6 million in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses of $96.4 million. Of
these amounts, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio represented $5,555.5 million in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses of
$88.6 million. Principal Life's consolidated portfolio consists of fixed maturity securities where 97% are investment grade (rated AAA through BBB-) with an average price of 98
(carrying value/amortized cost).

For
those securities that have been in a loss position for less than twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio holds 557 securities with a carrying value of
$4,913.8 million and unrealized losses of $56.8 million reflecting an average price of 99. Of this portfolio, 98.5% was investment grade (rated AAA through BBB-) at
December 31, 2004, with associated unrealized losses of $51.8 million. The losses on these securities can primarily be attributed to changes in market interest rates and changes in
credit spreads since the securities were acquired.

For
those securities that have been in a continuous loss position greater than or equal to twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio holds 80 securities with a carrying
value of $641.7 million and unrealized losses of $31.8 million. The average rating of this portfolio is BBB- with an average price of 95 at December 31, 2004. The
Corporate-public and Corporate-private sectors account for $26.7 million of the $31.8 million in unrealized losses. The average price of the corporate sectors is 95 and the average
credit rating is BBB+.

We
closely monitor our below investment grade holdings and those investment grade names where we have concerns. While we are in an unrealized loss position on these securities, all
securities except those identified as previously impaired continue to make payments. We consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether the impairment of a security is other than
temporary. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer,
including the current and future impact of any specific events; and (3) our ability and intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value. To the extent we determine that a
security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, the difference between amortized cost and fair value is charged to earnings.

Net Unrealized Gains and Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities

The net unrealized gains and losses on investments in fixed maturities and equity securities available-for-sale are reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity, reduced by adjustments to DPAC, sales inducements, unearned revenue reserves and PDO that would have been required as a charge or credit to operations had such
amounts been realized, and a provision for deferred income taxes.

Commercial Mortgage Loan Loss Allowance

Mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we determine that a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the
mortgage loan and the estimated value. Estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable
market price or fair value of the collateral. The change in the valuation allowance is included in net realized/unrealized capital losses on our consolidated statements of operations.

The
allowance for losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Management's periodic evaluation and assessment of the
adequacy of the allowance for losses and the need for mortgage impairments is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the
estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. The evaluation of our loan specific reserve component is also
subjective, as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Impaired mortgage loans, along with the related allowance for losses, were

Other Investments

Other investments include minority interests in unconsolidated entities and properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners. Such
investments are generally accounted for using the equity method. In applying the equity method, we record our share of income or loss reported by the equity investees. Changes in the value of our
investment in equity investees attributable to capital transactions of the investee, such as an additional offering of stock, are recorded directly to stockholders' equity. Total assets of the
unconsolidated entities amounted to $9,331.6 million and $6,901.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total revenues of the unconsolidated entities were
$1,785.6 million, $1,302.7 million and $752.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we included $89.3 million, $61.0 million and
$40.3 million, respectively, in net investment income representing our share of current year net income of the unconsolidated entities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our net investment
in unconsolidated entities was $321.7 million and $264.8 million, respectively, which primarily included our minority interests in domestic and international joint ventures and
partnerships.

In
the ordinary course of our business and as part of our investment operations, we have also entered into long term contracts to make and purchase investments aggregating
$882.8 million and $1,268.9 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Derivative
assets are reflected on our consolidated statements of financial position and reported as a component of other investments. Certain seed money investments are carried at fair
value with changes in fair value included in net income as net realized/unrealized capital gains or losses.

6.    Securitization Transactions

We, along with other contributors, sell commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions to trusts. As these trusts are classified as a qualifying special
purpose entity, they are not subject to the VIE consolidation rules. We retain primary servicing responsibilities and may retain other immaterial interests. We receive annual servicing fees
approximating 0.01% of the assets we are servicing, which approximates cost. The investors and the securitization entities have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due.
The value of our retained interests is subject primarily to credit risk.

In
2005, 2004, and 2003,we recognized gains of $39.8 million, $14.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively, on the securitization of commercial mortgage loans.

Key
economic assumptions used in measuring the retained interests at the date of securitization resulting from transactions completed included a cumulative foreclosure rate between 5%
and 18% during 2005, 4% and 10% during 2004, and 5% and 12% during 2003. The assumed range of the loss severity, as a percentage of defaulted loans, was between 3% and 29% during 2005, 13% and 31%
during 2004, and 14% and 33% during 2003. The low end of the loss severity range relates to a portfolio of seasoned loans. The high end of the loss severity range relates to a portfolio of newly
issued loans.

At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair values of retained interests related to the securitizations of commercial mortgage loans were $321.0 million and
$304.3 million, respectively. Only $0.8 million in each year represents equity interest investments. All other interests are classified as available-for-sale
securities and are carried at fair value. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, $181.3 million and $179.4 million of these available-for-sale
securities were interest-only investments. Cash flows are continuously monitored for adverse deviations from original expectations and impairments are recorded when necessary. Key economic
assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair values of residual cash flows were tested to one and two standard deviations from the expected rates. The changes in the fair values at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, as a result of this sensitivity analysis were not significant.

7.    Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are generally used to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks (primarily interest rate and foreign currency risks) associated with assets held or
expected to be purchased or sold and liabilities incurred or expected to be incurred. Derivatives are used to change the characteristics of our asset/liability mix consistent with our risk management
activities. Additionally, derivatives are also used in asset replication strategies. We do not buy, sell or hold these investments for trading purposes.

Types of Derivative Instruments

Interest rate swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate
interest amounts based upon designated market rates or rate indices and an agreed upon notional principal amount. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal
payments are made by either party. Cash is paid or received based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to
be made by one counterparty at each due date. We use interest rate swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities arising from timing mismatches
between assets and liabilities (including duration mismatches). We also use interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the value of assets we anticipate acquiring and other anticipated
transactions and commitments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against changes in the value of the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB") liability. The GMWB rider on our variable annuity
products provides for guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits regardless of the actual performance of various equity and/or fixed income funds available with the product.

In
exchange-traded futures transactions, we agree to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values of which are determined by the values of designated classes of
securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. We enter into exchange-traded futures with regulated
futures commissions merchants who are members of a trading exchange. In a mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") forward transaction, we agree to purchase or sell a specified MBS on a future date. We use
exchange-traded futures and MBS forwards to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates, to alter mismatches between the assets in a portfolio and the liabilities supported by those assets, and
to hedge against changes in the value of securities we own or anticipate acquiring or selling. We use exchange-traded futures to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB liability related to the
GMWB rider on our variable annuity product, as previously explained.

A
swaption is an option to enter into an interest rate swap at a future date. We write these options and receive a premium in order to transform our callable liabilities into fixed term
liabilities. In addition, we may sell an investment-type contract with attributes tied to market indices (an embedded derivative as noted below), in which case we write an equity call
option to convert the overall contract into a fixed-rate liability, essentially eliminating the equity component altogether. Equity call spreads are purchased to fund the equity
participation rates promised to contractholders in conjunction with our fixed deferred annuity products that credit interest based on changes in an external equity index. Equity put options are used
to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB liability related to the GMWB rider on our variable annuity products, as previously explained.

Total
return swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, an amount determined by the difference between the previous spread and the
current spread on referenced indices based upon an agreed upon notional principal amount plus an additional amount determined by the financing spread. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of
the contract and no principal payments are made by either party. Cash is paid or received based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide
for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty at each due date. These derivatives are used in our commercial mortgage securitization operation to hedge its long spread position.

Currency
forwards are contracts in which we agree with other parties to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. Typically, the price is agreed
upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. Currency swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between one currency and another at a forward exchange rate as calculated by reference to an agreed principal amount. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is
exchanged at the beginning and termination of the currency swap by each party. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one
counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date. We use currency forwards and currency swaps to reduce market risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect to
investments or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that we either hold or intend to acquire or sell. We also use currency forwards to hedge the currency risk associated with net investments
in foreign operations and anticipated earnings of its foreign operations.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

7.    Derivative Financial Instruments — (continued)

We
use credit default swaps to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by providing comparable exposure to fixed income securities that might not be available in the primary
market. They are also occasionally used to hedge credit exposures in our investment portfolio. Credit derivatives are used to sell or buy credit protection on an identified name or names on an
unfunded or synthetic basis in return for receiving or paying a quarterly premium. At the same time we enter into these synthetic transactions, we buy a quality cash bond to match against the credit
default swap. The premium generally corresponds to a referenced name's credit spread at the time the agreement is executed. When selling protection, if there is an event of default by the referenced
name, as defined by the agreement, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security in an amount equal to the notional value
of the credit default swap. At December 31, 2005, the notional amount of written credit default swaps was $1,297.6 million.

In
our commercial mortgage backed securitization operation, we enter into commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans at specified interest rates and other applicable terms within
specified periods of time. These commitments are legally binding agreements to extend credit to a counterparty. Loan commitments that will be held for sale are recognized as interest rate lock
commitment derivatives that are recorded at fair value. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected total cash flows using market rates that are applicable to the yield, credit quality and
maturity of each commitment. Loan commitments that are related to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for investment are not accounted for as derivatives and, accordingly, are not
recognized in our financial statements.

Exposure

Our risk of loss is typically limited to the fair value of our derivative instruments and not to the notional or contractual amounts of these derivatives. Risk
arises from changes in the fair value of the underlying instruments. We are also exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance of the counterparties. Our current credit exposure is limited
to the value of derivatives that have become favorable to us. This credit risk is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with high credit ratings and by establishing and
monitoring exposure limits. We also utilize various credit enhancements, including collateral and credit triggers to reduce the credit exposure to our derivative instruments.

Our
derivative transactions are generally documented under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements
provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a
transaction, we are permitted to set off our receivable from a counterparty against our payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions.

Prior
to the application of the aforementioned credit enhancements, the gross exposure to credit risk with respect to these derivative instruments was $472.9 million and
$951.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk was $375.3 million and
$554.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Fair Value Hedges

We use fixed-to-floating rate interest rate swaps to more closely align the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and
liabilities. In general, these swaps are used in asset and liability management to modify duration.

We
enter into currency exchange swap agreements to convert certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollar floating-rate denominated instruments to
eliminate the exposure to future currency volatility on those items.

We
use interest rates swaps and total return swaps to hedge interest rate and spread risk in our commercial mortgage securitization operations.

We
also sell callable investment-type agreements and use written interest rate swaptions to transform the callable liability into a fixed term liability.

We
recognized a pre-tax net loss of $(11.8) million, $(28.7) million and $(9.5) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relating to the ineffective
portion of our fair value hedges, which was reported with net realized/unrealized capital losses on our consolidated statements of operations. All gains or losses on derivatives were included in the
assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Cash Flow Hedges

We also utilize floating-to-fixed rate interest rate swaps to eliminate the variability in cash flows of financial assets and liabilities.

We
entered into currency exchange swap agreements to convert both principal and interest payments of certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollar denominated
fixed-rate instruments to eliminate the exposure to future currency volatility on those items.

At
December 31, 2005, we had no exposure to variable cash flows of an unrecognized firm commitment and at December 31, 2004, we had hedged the exposure to variable cash
flows of $46.7 million of unrecognized firm commitments. These 2004 firm commitments funded in the first quarter of 2005.

In
2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized a $27.0 million, $57.8 million and $(49.6) million after-tax increase (decrease) in value, respectively, related to cash
flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income. During this time period, none of our cash flow hedges have been discontinued because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction
would not occur by the end of the originally specified time period. We reclassified $21.3 million, $5.2 million, and $54.6 million in net losses from accumulated comprehensive
income into net income during 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively, and we expect to reclassify $0.7 million net losses in the next 12 months.

For
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.2 million and $1.9 million in net income due to cash flow
ineffectiveness, respectively. For the year ended December 2003, the cash flow ineffectiveness was immaterial. All gains or losses on derivatives were included in the assessment of hedge
effectiveness.

The
maximum length of time that we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions, excluding those related to the payments of variable
interest on existing financial assets and liabilities, is 13.5 years.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedges

From time to time, we may take measures to hedge our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries from currency risks. In 2004 and 2005, we used currency forwards
to hedge a portion of our net investment in our Mexican operations and in 2005 we also used currency forwards to hedge a portion of our net investment in our Chilean operations. We did not have any
currency forwards outstanding at December 31, 2005 to hedge our net investment in foreign operations. We recognized a $2.7 million pre-tax loss and a $0.2 million
pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income from these contracts for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There was no ineffectiveness recorded for the years
ended December 31, 2005 or 2004. All gains or losses on derivatives were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

Our use of futures, MBS forwards, certain swaptions and swaps, equity call options, credit default swaps, bond options, currency forwards, and interest rate lock
commitments are effective from an economic standpoint, but they have not been designated as hedges under SFAS 133. As such, periodic changes in the market value of these instruments flow
directly into net income. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, gains (losses) of $13.1 million,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

7.    Derivative Financial Instruments — (continued)

$(59.0) million
and $68.5 million, respectively, were recognized in income from market value changes of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment.

Embedded Derivatives

We may purchase or issue financial instruments or products that contain a derivative instrument that is embedded in the financial instrument or products. When it
is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly or closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and a separate instrument
with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host
instrument in the consolidated statements of financial position, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income.

We
sell investment-type liability contracts in which the return is tied to an external equity index. The equity return is an embedded option that is bifurcated from the host
investment-type contract and accounted for separately. We economically hedge the embedded derivative by writing equity call options with identical features to convert the overall contract
into a fixed-rate liability, effectively eliminating the equity component altogether. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, we recognized a
$1.0 million and $3.2 million pre-tax gain on the purchased equity call options and a $1.0 million and $3.2 million pre-tax loss on the change in
fair value of the embedded derivatives.

We
offer a guaranteed fund as an investment option in our defined contribution plans in Hong Kong. This fund contains an embedded option that has been bifurcated and accounted for
separately, with changes in fair value reported in net realized/unrealized gains (losses). There was no pre-tax gain or loss recognized for the
year ended December 31, 2005. We recognized a $0.1 million pre-tax gain for the year ended December 31, 2004.

We
contributed undated subordinated floating rate notes to three grantor trusts. The trusts separated the cash flows of the underlying notes by issuing an interest-only
certificate and a residual certificate related to each note contributed. We retained the interest-only certificates and the residual certificates were subsequently sold to a third party.
We have determined these grantor trusts are variable interest entities and it is necessary for us to consolidate these entities. The obligation to deliver the underlying securities to residual
certificate holders of $147.4 million as of December 31, 2005, and $138.1 million as of December 31, 2004 is classified as an other liability and contains an embedded
derivative of the forecasted transaction to deliver the underlying securities. For the years ended December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively, we recognized a
$2.7 million pre-tax gain and a $28.2 million pre-tax loss on the change in fair value of the obligation, which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
income on the consolidated statements of financial position.

During
2005, we purchased existing Class A units of a trust that represent interest payments on the underlying security within the trust. The trust also issued Class B
units representing the residual interests in the underlying. We have determined that this trust is a variable interest entity and subsequent to this purchase it is necessary for us to consolidate this
entity. The obligation to deliver the underlying security to the Class B unit holder of $10.5 million as of December 31, 2005, is classified as an other liability and contains an
embedded derivative of the forecasted transaction to deliver the underlying security. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a $0.4 million pre-tax loss on the
change in fair value of the obligation, which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position.

We
offer a fixed deferred annuity product that credits interest based on changes in an external equity index. It contains an embedded derivative that has been bifurcated and accounted
for separately, with changes in fair value reported in net realized/unrealized gains (losses). We economically hedge the fixed deferred annuity product by purchasing options that match the product's
profile. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recognized a $1.5 million and $0.5 million pre-tax gain on the call spread options purchased and a
$2.3 million and $0.2 pre-tax loss on the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives.

We
offer certain variable annuity products with a GMWB rider. The GMWB provides that the contractholder will receive at least their principal deposit back through withdrawals of up to a
specified annual amount, even if the account value is reduced to zero. The GMWB represents an embedded derivative in the variable annuity contract that is required to be reported separately from the
host variable annuity contract. Declines in the equity market may increase our exposure to benefits under contracts with the GMWB. We economically hedge the GMWB exposure using futures, options and
interest rate swaps. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a $0.5 million pre-tax loss on the hedging instruments and a $0.2 million pre-tax
gain on the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives in net income.

8.    Closed Block

In connection with the 1998 MIHC formation, Principal Life formed a Closed Block to provide reasonable assurance to policyholders included therein that, after the
formation of the MIHC, assets would be available to maintain dividends in aggregate in accordance with the 1997 policy dividend scales, if the experience underlying such scales continued. Assets of
Principal Life were allocated to the Closed Block in an amount that produces cash flows which, together with anticipated revenue from policies and contracts included in the Closed Block, were expected
to be sufficient to support the Closed Block policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for payment of claims, certain expenses, charges and taxes, and to provide for continuation of policy
and contract dividends in aggregate in accordance with the 1997 dividend scales, if the experience underlying such scales continues, and to allow for appropriate adjustments in such scales, if such
experience changes. Due to adjustable life policies being included in the Closed Block, the Closed Block is charged with amounts necessary to properly fund for certain adjustments, such as face amount
and premium increases, that are made to these policies after the Closed Block inception date. These amounts are referred to as Funding Adjustment Charges and are treated as capital transfers from the
Closed Block.

Assets
allocated to the Closed Block inure solely to the benefit of the holders of policies included in the Closed Block. Closed Block assets and liabilities are carried on the same
basis as other similar assets and liabilities. Principal Life will continue to pay guaranteed benefits under all policies, including the policies within the Closed Block, in accordance with their
terms. If the assets allocated to the Closed Block, the investment cash flows from those assets and the revenues from the policies included in the Closed Block, including investment income thereon,
prove to be insufficient to pay the benefits guaranteed under the policies included in the Closed Block, Principal Life will be required to make such payments from their general funds. No additional
policies were added to the Closed Block, nor was the Closed Block affected in any other way, as a result of the demutualization.

A
PDO is required to be established for earnings in the Closed Block that are not available to stockholders. A model of the Closed Block was established to produce the pattern of
expected earnings in the Closed Block (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income).


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

8.    Closed Block — (continued)

If
actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the Closed Block, only the expected cumulative earnings will be recognized in
income with the excess recorded as a PDO. This PDO represents undistributed accumulated earnings that will be paid to Closed Block policyholders as additional policyholder dividends unless offset by
future performance of the Closed Block that is less favorable than originally expected. If actual cumulative performance is less favorable than expected, only actual earnings will be recognized in
income. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, cumulative actual earnings have been less than cumulative expected earnings. However, cumulative net unrealized gains were greater than expected,
resulting in the recognition of a PDO of $33.7 million, $118.5 million, and $99.0 million as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Our
GICs and funding agreements contain provisions limiting early surrenders, which typically include penalties for early surrenders, minimum notice requirements or, in the case of
funding agreements with survivor options, minimum pre-death holding periods and specific maximum amounts.

Funding
agreements include those issued directly to nonqualified institutional investors, as well as to three separate programs where the funding agreements have been issued directly or
indirectly to unconsolidated special purpose entities. Claims for principal and interest under funding agreements are afforded equal priority to claims of life insurance and annuity policyholders
under insolvency provisions of Iowa Insurance Laws.

We
are authorized to issue up to $4.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in 1998 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an unaffiliated
entity in non-U.S. markets. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, $3,203.6 million and $3,867.0 million, respectively, of liabilities are being held with respect to the issuance outstanding under this program.

In
addition, we were authorized to issue up to $7.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in 2001 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by
an unaffiliated entity in both domestic and international markets. The unaffiliated entity is an unconsolidated qualifying special purpose entity. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
$4,744.5 million and $5,462.3 million, respectively, of liabilities are being held with respect to the issuance outstanding under this program. We do not anticipate any new issuance
activity under this program, given our December 2005 termination of the dealership agreement for this program and the availability of the SEC-registered program described in the
next paragraph.

We
were authorized to issue up to $4.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in March 2004 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by
unaffiliated entities in both domestic and international markets. Under this program, both the notes and the supporting funding agreements are registered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2005
and 2004, $3,667.9 million and $1,831.5 million, respectively, of liabilities are being held with respect to the issuance outstanding under this program. In contrast with direct funding
agreements, GIC issuances and the other two funding agreement-backed medium term note programs described above, Principal Life's payment obligations on each funding agreement issued under this
SEC-registered program are guaranteed by Principal Financial Group, Inc. In recognition of the use of nearly all $4.0 billion of initial issuance authorization, this program
was amended in February 2006 to authorize issuance of up to an additional $5.0 billion.

December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relating to prior years. Such liability adjustments, which affected current operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, resulted in part
from developed claims for prior years being different than were anticipated when the liabilities for unpaid accident and health claims were originally estimated. In addition, in 2003, we established a
premium deficiency reserve on our medical conversion business that was previously included in our incurred but not reported claim reserve. These trends have been considered in establishing the current
year liability for unpaid accident and health claims. We also had claim adjustment expenses of $30.6 million, $28.3 million and $27.7 million, and related reinsurance recoverables
of $3.5 million, $3.6 million and $2.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which are not included in the rollforward above.

On
November 3, 2005, Principal International de Chile S.A., a wholly owned indirect subsidiary, entered into long-term borrowing agreements with two Chilean
banks in the amount of US $93.9 million. This debt is denominated in Unidades de Formento ("UF"), a Chilean inflation-indexed, peso-denominated monetary unit. Of this amount,
US $49.0 million of UF +4.59% notes and US $44.9 million of UF +4.93% notes mature on November 3, 2011. Interest on the notes is payable
semi-annually on May 3 and November 3 each year. The debt outstanding and interest expense will vary due to fluctuations in the Chilean peso to US dollar exchange rates and
Chilean inflation.

On
August 25, 1999, Principal Financial Group (Australia) Holdings Pty. Limited, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary, issued $665.0 million of unsecured redeemable
long-term debt. Of this amount, $200.0 million of 7.95% notes matured on August 15, 2004, with the remaining $465.0 million in 8.2% notes due August 15, 2009.
Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. Principal Financial Group (Australia) Holdings Pty. Limited used the net proceeds from the notes
to partially fund the purchase of the outstanding stock of several companies affiliated with Bankers Trust Australia Group. On December 28, 2001, all of the long-term debt
obligations of Principal Financial Group (Australia) Holdings Pty. Limited were assumed by its parent, Principal Financial Services, Inc.

On
March 10, 1994, Principal Life issued $300.0 million of surplus notes, including $200.0 million due March 1, 2024, at a 7.875% annual interest rate and the
remaining $100.0 million due March 1, 2044, at an 8% annual interest rate. None of our affiliates hold any portion of the notes. Each payment of interest and principal on the notes,
however, may be made only with the prior approval of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa (the "Commissioner") and only to the extent that Principal Life has sufficient surplus earnings
to make such payments. Interest for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 of $8.0 million, $10.6 million and $23.8 million, respectively, was approved by the
Commissioner, and charged to expense.

After
receiving approval from the Commissioner, the surplus notes due March 1, 2024, were optionally redeemed by Principal Life on March 1, 2004, in whole at a redemption
price of approximately 103.6% of par. Total cash paid for the surplus note redemption on March 1, 2004, was $207.2 million.

Subject
to Commissioner approval, the notes due March 1, 2044, may be redeemed at Principal Life's election on or after March 1, 2014, in whole or in part at a redemption
price of approximately 102.3% of par. The approximate 2.3% premium is scheduled to gradually diminish over the following ten years. These notes may be redeemed on or after March 1, 2024, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus interest accrued to the date of redemption.

The
mortgages and other notes payable are financings for real estate developments. We, including certain subsidiaries, had $135.0 million in credit facilities as of
December 31, 2005, with various financial institutions, in addition to obtaining loans with various lenders to finance these developments. Outstanding principal balances as of
December 31, 2005, range from $0.3 million to $97.5 million per development with interest rates generally ranging from 5.5% to 8.6%. Outstanding principal balances as of
December 31, 2004, range from $0.4 million to $98.7 million per development with interest rates generally ranging from 6.0% to 8.6%. Outstanding debt is secured by the underlying
real estate properties,

pre-tax income and our effective tax rate on pre-tax income are generally due to inherent differences between income for financial reporting
purposes and income for tax purposes and the establishment of adequate provisions for any challenges of the tax filings and tax payments to the various taxing jurisdictions. A reconciliation between
the corporate income tax rate and the effective tax rate from continuing operations is as follows:

At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, our net deferred tax liability is comprised of international net deferred tax assets of $9.6 million and $20.5 million,
which have been included in other assets, international net deferred tax liabilities of $115.4 million and $89.9 million and U.S. net deferred tax liabilities of $859.4 million
and $1,041.8 million, which have been included in deferred income taxes in the consolidated statements of financial position.

The
Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") has completed examinations of the U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns for 2001 and prior years. The Service is currently examining
returns for 2002 and 2003. The Service's completion of the examinations for the years 1999-2001 resulted in notices of deficiency dated December 29, 2004, and March 1, 2005.
We paid the deficiencies (approximately $444.0 million for 1999 and 2000, and $1.3 million for 2001, including interest) in the first quarter of 2005 and plan to file claims for refund
relating to the disputed adjustments. The majority of the deficiencies are attributable to the disallowance of carrybacks of capital losses, net operating losses and foreign tax credits arising in
years after 2001. We expect the Service to allow some of the carrybacks within the next year upon completion of the audit of the returns for the years in which the losses and credits arose. The
remainder of the deficiencies are attributable to both contested issues and adjustments that we
have accepted. We believe that we have adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution of the contested issues could take several years while legal
remedies are pursued. Consequently, we do not expect the ultimate resolution of issues in tax years 1999-2001 to have a material impact on our net income. Similarly, we believe there are
adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, any challenges that might arise in tax years subsequent to 2001.

U.S.
Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on approximately $193.9 million of accumulated but undistributed earnings from operations of foreign subsidiaries. Such
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. It is not practical to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability that would arise if these earnings were
remitted due to foreign tax credits and exclusions that may become available at the time of remittance. A tax liability will be recognized when we no longer plan to indefinitely reinvest the earnings
or when we plan to sell all or a portion of our ownership interest.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law. The Act includes a repatriation provision granting U.S. corporations a special
deduction of 85% of certain qualifying dividends from their foreign subsidiaries. A company could elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that are repatriated in its 2005 tax year. Based
on the interpretive guidance issued to date by the Service, we currently believe that we will elect to utilize this repatriation provision in our 2005 tax year. Although it is dependent on a number of
factors, the amount that we are considering for application under this provision is approximately $27.0 million. Our current tax accrual reflects application of the provisions of the Act.

Net
cash paid for income taxes in 2005 was $638.1 million, primarily due to the notices of deficiency noted above, and $599.3 million in 2004, of which
$444.3 million was attributable to Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. Net cash received for income taxes in 2003 was $72.0 million, primarily due to refunds for the 2002 loss on
the sale of BT Financial Group, and the favorable settlement of an Internal Revenue Service audit issue.

13.    Employee and Agent Benefits

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our employees and certain agents. Some of these plans provide supplemental pension benefits to
employees with salaries and/or pension benefits in excess of the qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law. The employees and agents are generally first eligible for the pension plans when they
reach age 21. For plan participants employed prior to January 1, 2002, the pension benefits are based on the greater of a final average pay benefit or a cash balance benefit. The final average
pay benefit is based on the years of service and generally the employee's or agent's average annual compensation during the last five years of employment. Partial benefit accrual of final average pay
benefits is recognized from first eligibility until retirement based on attained service divided by potential service to age 65 with a minimum of 35 years of potential service. The cash balance
portion of the plan started on January 1, 2002. An employee's account will be credited with an amount based on the employee's salary, age and service. These credits will accrue with interest.
For plan participants hired on and after January 1, 2002, only the cash balance plan applies. Our policy is to fund the cost of providing pension benefits in the years that the employees and
agents are providing service to us. Our funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plan is to contribute an amount annually at least equal to the minimum annual contribution required
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Our funding policy for the
non-qualified benefit plan is to fund the plan in the years that the employees are providing service to us using a methodology similar to the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost
under U.S. GAAP, but using long-term assumptions. However, if the U.S. GAAP funded status is positive, no deposit is made. While we fund this plan, the assets are not included as part of
the asset balances presented in this footnote as they do not qualify as assets under SFAS No. 87,

Employers' Accounting for Pensions,

("SFAS 87"), however, they are included in our consolidated statements of financial position.

We
also provide certain health care, life insurance and long-term care benefits for retired employees. Subsidized retiree health benefits are provided for employees hired
prior to January 1, 2002. Employees hired after December 31, 2001, will have access to retiree health benefits but will need to pay for the full cost of the coverage. The health care
plans are contributory with participants' contributions adjusted annually; the contributions are based on the number of years of service and age at retirement for those hired prior to
January 1, 2002. As part of the substantive plan, the retiree health contributions are assumed to be adjusted in the future as claim levels change. The life insurance plans are contributory for
a small group of previously grandfathered participants that have elected supplemental coverage and dependent coverage.

Covered
employees are first eligible for the medical and life postretirement benefits when they reach age 57 and have completed ten years of service with us. Retiree
long-term care benefits are provided for employees whose retirement was effective prior to July 1, 2000. Partial benefit accrual of these health, life and long-term care
benefits is recognized from the employee's date of hire until retirement based on attained service divided by potential service to age 65 with a minimum of 35 years of potential service. Our
policy is to fund the cost of providing retiree benefits in the years that the employees are providing service to us using a methodology similar to the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost
under U.S. GAAP, but using long-term assumptions. However, if the U.S. GAAP funded status is positive, no deposit is made.

We
use a measurement date of October 1 for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Employer contributions to the pension plans include contributions made directly to the qualified pension plan assets and contributions from corporate assets to
pay nonqualified pension benefits. Benefits paid from the pension plans include both qualified and nonqualified plan benefits. Nonqualified pension plan assets are not included as part of the asset
balances presented in this footnote. The nonqualified pension plan assets are held in a Rabbi trust for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. The assets held in a Rabbi trust are
available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy. Therefore, these assets are fully consolidated in our consolidated statements of financial position and are not
reflected in our funded status as they do not qualify as assets under SFAS 87. The market value of assets held in these trusts was $198.3 million as of December 31, 2005, and
$181.0 million as of December 31, 2004.

The
Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. divestiture in 2004 resulted in a curtailment under SFAS No. 88,

Employers' Accounting for
Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits

, for the plans


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

13.    Employee and Agent Benefits — (continued)

that
provided benefits to the Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. participants. A mid-year re-measurement to reflect the curtailment occurred as of the date of sale,
July 1, 2004. Curtailment gains of $25.1 million and $3.9 million occurred under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively in 2004. This did not affect the
pension plans or other postretirement benefit plans covering agents and managers. In addition, this did not affect the long-term care plan because these plans consist of only retired
participants.

Due
to the Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. divestiture, we provided for contractual termination benefits in connection with termination of employment for a select group of
Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. management employees. The pension plan recognized $1.8 million in special termination benefits liability in 2004.

As
of January 1, 2006, changes were made to our retirement program, including the Principal Select Saving Plan ("401(k)"), the Principal Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") and to the
corresponding nonqualified plans. The qualified and nonqualified pension plan changes include a reduction to the traditional and cash balance formulas, a change in the early retirement factors, and
the removal of the cost of living adjustments for traditional benefits earned after January 1, 2006. The qualified and nonqualified 401(k) plan's company match will increase from 50% of a
contribution rate up to a maximum of 3% of the participant's compensation to 75% of a contribution rate up to a maximum of 6% of the participant's compensation. Employees who were at least
47 years old, with a minimum of 10 years of service as of December 31, 2005, were given the choice to remain under the current pension and 401(k) arrangement or move to the new
plan design. The vast majority of this group chose to remain under the current pension and 401(k) arrangement. The Pension Plan changes were recognized as a prior service benefit and resulted in a
reduction of liabilities of $73.9 million.

The
pension plans' gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of employees. For the qualified pension
plan, there is no corridor recognized in determining the amount to amortize; for the nonqualified pension plans, the corridor allowed under SFAS 87 is used.

For
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the pension plans had an actuarial loss of $121.1 million and $62.6 million, respectively. These losses were
primarily due to the decrease in discount rate each year.

On
December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Medicare Modernization Act") was signed into law. The Medicare Modernization
Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare ("Medicare Part D") as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree medical benefit plans. The prescription drug benefits offered by the
sponsor must be at least actuarially equivalent to benefits offered under Medicare Part D to qualify for the subsidy. This subsidy is effective in 2006 and would only apply to benefits paid for
qualifying retirees who have not enrolled in Medicare Part D.

On
July 26, 2004, the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") issued proposed regulations that provided guidance on the definition of actuarially equivalent retiree
prescription drug coverage. These regulations aided in our third quarter of 2004 determination that the majority of our retiree prescription drug benefit coverage is actuarially equivalent to
Medicare's Part D prescription drug plan and thus makes us eligible for the tax-free subsidy beginning in 2006. Accordingly, we conducted a mid-year
re-measurement during third quarter of 2004 of our retiree medical plans to reflect the recognition of the Medicare Modernization Act in accordance with FASB Staff Position
No. 106-2,

"Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related
to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003"

. This caused an actuarial gain of approximately $22.5 million for the medical plans. In
addition, it also caused the net periodic benefit cost for 2004 to change for the fourth quarter. The 2004 service cost decreased by approximately $0.2 million, interest cost decreased
approximately $0.4 billion and the actuarial loss amortization decreased by $0.1 million.

An
actuarial liability gain of $19.8 million occurred during 2005 for the other postretirement benefit plans. This was due to a less than assumed increase in health care claim
costs and trend assumption, as well as a refinement in the recognition of Medicare Part D government subsidy. This liability gain was offset by a liability loss caused by a decrease in the
discount rate.

There
was an aggregate actuarial liability loss of $22.3 million during 2004 for the other postretirement benefit plans. Of this, $44.8 million was due to an actuarial
liability loss experience primarily due to the 25 basis point drop in the discount rate and an increase in the health care cost trend rate. However, this loss was partially offset by the
$22.5 million in actuarial liability gain due to the recognition of the Medicare Modernization Act.

The
accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,239.2 million and $1,098.6 million at December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The
discount rate used to calculate the benefit expense for the first three quarters of 2004 expense related to the home office pension and other postretirement benefit plans and
retiree medical plans was 6.25%. The discount rate used to calculate the benefit expense for the last quarter of 2004 was 6.50%. The change in rates occurred due to the third quarter 2004
remeasurement for the Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. divestiture and Medicare Modernization Act. A remeasurement did not occur on the agents and managers pension and other
non-medical postretirement benefit plans.

For
other postretirement benefits, the 7.30% rate for 2005 is based on the weighted average expected long-term asset returns for the medical, life and long-term
care plans. The expected long-term rates for the medical, life and long-term care plans are 7.25%, 7.75% and 5.85%, respectively.

The
expected return on plan assets is the long-term rate we expect to be earned based on the plans' investment strategy. Historical and expected future returns of multiple
asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk free rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class. The overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term
inflation component, the risk free real rate of return and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on those overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plans.
Based on a review in 2005, the long term expected return on plan assets was lowered to 8.25% for the 2006 pension expense calculation.

Our investment strategy is to achieve the following:

•

Obtain
a reasonable long-term return consistent with the level of risk assumed and at a cost of operation within prudent levels. Performance benchmarks are
monitored.

•

Ensure
sufficient liquidity to meet the emerging benefit liabilities for the plan.

•

Provide
for diversification of assets in an effort to avoid the risk of large losses and maximize the investment return to the pension plan consistent with market and
economic risk.

In
administering the qualified pension plan's asset allocation strategy, we consider the projected liability stream of benefit payments, the relationship between current and projected
assets of the plan and the projected actuarial liabilities streams, the historical performance of capital markets adjusted for the perception of future short- and long-term capital market
performance and the perception of future economic conditions.

The
overall target asset allocation for the qualified plan assets is:

For 2005 and 2004, respectively, the plan assets include zero and $26.6 million in Principal Financial Group stock held under a separate account under an
annuity contract. These assets were received in the qualified defined benefit plan as a result of the demutualization. These holdings were liquidated as of April 30, 2005.

The investment strategies and policies for the other postretirement benefit plans are similar to those employed by the qualified pension plan.

Contributions

We expect to contribute roughly $0.5 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2006. Our funding policy for the qualified pension plan is to
fund the plan annually in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contribution required under ERISA and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income
tax purposes. We do not anticipate that we will be required to fund a minimum annual contribution under ERISA for the qualified pension plan. At this time, it is too early to estimate the amount that
may be contributed, but it is possible that we may fund the plans in 2006 in the range of $20-$50 million. This includes funding for both our qualified and nonqualified pension
plans.

the cost, which is funded by their contributions to the plan.

The
assumptions used in calculating the estimated future benefit payments are the same as those used to measure the benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2005.

In addition, we have defined contribution plans that are generally available to all employees and agents who are 21 or older. Eligible participants could not
contribute more than $14,000 of their compensation to the plans in 2005. In 2005, we matched the participant's contribution at a 50% contribution rate up to a maximum contribution of 3% of the
participant's compensation. The defined contribution plans allow employees to choose among various investment options, including our common stock. We contributed $19.0 million,
$18.6 million and $18.5 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively, to our qualified defined contribution plans.

We
also have a nonqualified defined contribution plan available to select employees and agents who are age 21 and over which allows them to contribute amounts in excess of limits imposed
by federal tax law. In 2005, we matched the participant's contribution at a 50% contribution rate up to a maximum contribution of 3% of the participant's compensation. We contributed
$4.8 million, $4.5 million and $3.7 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, to our nonqualified defined contribution plans.

14.    Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications

Litigation

We are regularly involved in litigation, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff, but primarily as a defendant. Litigation naming us as a defendant ordinarily
arises out of our business operations as a provider of asset management and accumulation products and services, life, health and disability insurance. Some of the lawsuits are class actions, or
purport to be, and some include claims for punitive damages. In addition, regulatory bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
the Department of Labor and other regulatory bodies regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities
laws, ERISA and laws governing the activities of broker-dealers.

Several
lawsuits have been filed against other insurance companies and insurance brokers alleging improper conduct relating to the payment and non-disclosure of contingent
compensation and bid-rigging activity. Several of these suits were filed as purported class actions. Several state attorneys general and insurance regulators have initiated
industry-wide inquiries or other actions relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers and insurance companies and other industry issues. We received a subpoena on
March 3, 2005 from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York seeking information on compensation agreements associated with the sale of retirement products. On
January 13, 2006, we received a subpoena and a set of interrogatories from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut seeking information and documents relating to payment
of contingent compensation to brokers and actions in restraint of trade in the sale of group annuities. We are cooperating with these inquiries. We have received requests from regulators and other
governmental authorities relating to industry issues and may receive such requests in the future.

On
December 23, 2004, a lawsuit was filed in Iowa state court against us and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Principal Life and Principal Financial Services, Inc., on behalf
of a proposed class comprised of the settlement class in the Principal Life sales practices class action settlement, which was approved in April 2001 by the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Iowa. This more recent lawsuit claims that the treatment of the settlement costs of that sales practices litigation in relation to the allocation of demutualization consideration
to Principal Life policyholders was inappropriate. Demutualization allocation was done pursuant to the terms of a plan of demutualization approved by the policyholders in July 2001 and
Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa in August 2001. The lawsuit further claims that such allocation was not accurately described to policyholders during the demutualization process and
is a breach of the sales practices settlement. On January 27, 2005, we filed a notice to remove the action from state court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Iowa. On July 22, 2005, the plaintiff's motion to remand the action to state court was denied, and our motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted. On September 21, 2005, the plaintiff's
motion to alter or amend the judgment was denied. On October 4, 2005, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the United State Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. A lawsuit was filed
against us, Principal Life, and Principal Financial Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa on October 31, 2005. The claims and allegations
in the new lawsuit are substantially the same as those in the December 23, 2004 lawsuit, but the proposed class is limited to those members of the settlement class in the Principal Life sales
practices class action settlement who did not own annuities and who received demutualization consideration in the form of cash under the plan of demutualization. We have filed a motion to dismiss all
claims.

While
the outcome of any pending or future litigation cannot be predicted, management does not believe that any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business or
financial position. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and unforeseen results can occur. It is possible that such outcomes could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or
annual period.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, we have provided guarantees to third parties primarily related to a former subsidiary, joint ventures and industrial revenue
bonds. These agreements generally expire from 2005 through 2019. The maximum exposure under these agreements as of December 31, 2005, was approximately $193.0 million; however, we
believe the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required and therefore have not accrued for a liability on our consolidated statements of financial position. Should we be required to
perform under these guarantees, we generally could recover a portion of the loss from third parties through recourse provisions included in agreements with such parties, the sale of assets held as
collateral that can be liquidated in the event that performance is required under the guarantees or other recourse generally available to us, therefore, such guarantees would not result in a material
adverse effect on our business or financial position. It is possible that such outcomes could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period. The fair value of such guarantees
issued after January 1, 2003, was determined to be insignificant.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

14.    Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications — (continued)

In
connection with the 2002 sale of BT Financial Group, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser, Westpac Banking Corporation ("Westpac"), for among other things, the costs associated
with potential late filings made by BT Financial Group in New Zealand prior to Westpac's ownership, up to a maximum of A$250.0 million Australian dollars (approximately U.S.
$184.0 million as of December 31, 2005). New Zealand securities regulations allow Australian issuers to issue their securities in New Zealand provided that certain documents are
appropriately filed with the New Zealand Registrar of Companies. Specifically, the regulations require that any amendments to constitutions and compliance plans be filed in New Zealand. In
April 2003, the New Zealand Securities Commission ("the Commission") opined that such late filings would result in certain New Zealand investors having a right to return of their investment
plus interest at 10% per annum from the date of investment.

This
technical issue affected many in the industry. On April 15, 2004, the New Zealand government enacted legislation that will provide issuers, including BT Financial
Group, the opportunity for retroactive relief from such late filing violations. The law allows issuers to apply for judicial validation of non-compliant issuances resulting from late
filings. The law further provides that judicial relief is mandatory and unconditional unless an investor was materially prejudiced by the late filing. Such judicial relief has been granted to
BT Financial Group and Westpac with regard to the vast majority of affected investors. As a result, we do not believe that this matter will result in a material adverse effect on our business
or financial position. It is possible, however, that it could have a material adverse effect on net income in a particular quarter or annual period.

On
December 24, 2004, Westpac lodged several warranty and indemnification claims related to the sale of BT Financial Group. Under the sale agreements, certain warranty
claims were required to be lodged by December 31, 2004. The claims aggregate approximately A$50.0 million Australian dollars (approximately U.S. $37.0 million as of
December 31, 2005) with the majority of the claims (approximately A$45.0 million Australian dollars, or U.S. $33.0 million as of December 31, 2005) related to fund
pricing and accounting issues around a tax asset called future income tax benefit ("FITB"). FITB is an asset used in calculating unit pricing of funds. Westpac claims that BT Financial Group
incorrectly accrued FITB assets in valuing asset portfolios of BT funds in Australia and New Zealand and that as a result fund values were overstated. We intend to vigorously defend against these
claims. Although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or reasonably estimate possible losses, we do not believe that it would result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial
position. It is possible, however, that it could have a material adverse effect on net income in a particular quarter or annual period.

We
are also subject to various other indemnification obligations issued in conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the sale of BT Financial Group, Principal Residential
Mortgage, Inc., and other divestitures, acquisitions and financing transactions whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Certain portions of these
indemnifications may be capped, while other portions are not subject to such limitations; therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under the indemnifications cannot be reasonably
estimated. While we are unable to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these indemnifications, we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments
would be required under such indemnifications and therefore such indemnifications would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. It is possible that such outcomes
could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period. The fair value of such indemnifications issued after January 1, 2003, was determined to be insignificant.

Operating Leases

As a lessee, we lease office space, data processing equipment and office furniture and equipment under various operating leases. Rental expense for the year ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, was $52.1 million, $46.2 million and $49.5 million.

At
December 31, 2005, the future minimum lease payments are $165.5 million. The following represents payments due by period for operating lease obligations as of
December 31, 2005 (in millions).

Securities Posted as Collateral

We posted $386.9 million in securities under collateral agreements at December 31, 2005, to satisfy collateral requirements primarily associated
with our derivatives credit support agreements and a reinsurance arrangement with our U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment.

15.    Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock

As of December 31, 2005, we had 13.0 million shares of perpetual preferred stock authorized, issued and outstanding under the two series described
below. Preferred stockholders have dividend and liquidation priority over common stockholders.

Series A.

On June 16, 2005, we issued 3.0 million shares of fixed rate,
non-cumulative, Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"), at an initial offering price of $100 per share. We received net proceeds of
$296.0 million after offering costs. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and are payable quarterly when, and if, declared by our Board of Directors.
Dividends commenced on September 30, 2005, at a rate of 5.563% per annum of the liquidation preference. On or after the dividend payment date in June 2015, the Series A initial
distribution rate will become a floating rate, subject to reset, at our option, subject to certain conditions and parameters. If reset, the rate may be at fixed or floating rates. On or after the
dividend payment date in June 2015, we may, at our option, redeem the shares at a price of $100 per share, or $300.0 million in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the
then current dividend period to the date of redemption, if any.

The
Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not convertible into any other of our securities. Series A Preferred Stock will have no voting rights, except
with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the shares and in the case of certain dividend non-payments.

Series B.

On June 16, 2005, we issued 10.0 million shares of fixed rate,
non-cumulative, Series B Perpetual Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred Stock"), at an initial offering price of $25 per share. We received net proceeds of
$246.0 million after offering costs. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and are payable quarterly when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors.
Dividends commenced on September 30, 2005, at a rate of 6.518% per annum of the liquidation preference. On or after the dividend payment date in June 2035, the Series B initial
distribution rate will become a floating rate, subject to reset, at our option, subject to certain conditions and parameters. If reset, the rate may be at fixed or floating rates. On or after the
dividend payment date
in June 2015, we may, at our option, redeem the shares at a price of $25 per share, or $250.0 million in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the then current dividend
period to the date of redemption, if any.

The
Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not convertible into any other of our securities. Series B Preferred Stock will have no voting rights, except
with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the shares and in the case of certain dividend non-payments.

Dividend Restrictions and Payments

The certificates of designations for the Series A and B Preferred Stock restrict the declaration of preferred dividends if we fail to meet specified
capital adequacy, net income or stockholders' equity levels. As of December 31, 2005, we have no preferred dividend restrictions.

On
December 30, 2005, we paid a dividend of $8.3 million, equal to $1.39 per share on Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and equal to
$0.41 per share on Series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, to stockholders of record as of December 15, 2005.

On
September 30, 2005, we paid a dividend of $9.4 million, equal to $1.59 per share on Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and equal to
$0.47 per share on Series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, to stockholders of record as of September 1, 2005.

Common Stock

On December 16, 2005, we paid an annual dividend of $182.2 million, equal to $0.65 per share, to stockholders of record as of November 17,
2005. On December 17, 2004, we paid an annual dividend of $166.5 million, equal to $0.55 per share, to stockholders of record as of November 12, 2004. On December 8, 2003,
we paid an annual dividend of $145.3 million, equal to $0.45 per share, to stockholders of record as of November 7, 2003.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

15.    Stockholders' Equity — (continued)

In
June 2005, following our Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization of up to 15.0 million shares, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with
a third party investment bank for approximately 13.7 million shares of our common stock with an initial payment of $542.3 million, using cash proceeds from the preferred stock issuance.
The transaction was subject to a market price adjustment provision based on the volume weighted average market price over the execution period, which could be settled in shares or cash. On
October 3, 2005, we elected to settle in cash. On November 10, 2005, the transaction was completed for an additional payment of $84.0 million. We do not intend to make further
purchases under this program.

In
the last three years, our Board of Directors has authorized various repurchase programs under which we are allowed to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. Shares
repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock, carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to stockholders' equity.

In
November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2005, no
purchases have been made under this program.

Dividend Limitations

Under Iowa law, Principal Life may pay stockholder dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the
Commissioner to pay a stockholder dividend if such a stockholder dividend would exceed certain statutory limitations. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of Principal Life's
policyholder surplus as of the preceding year-end or the net gain from operations from the previous calendar year. Based on this limitation and 2005 statutory results, Principal Life could
pay approximately $630.7 million in stockholder dividends in 2006 without exceeding the statutory limitation.

16.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following discussion describes the methods and assumptions we utilize in estimating our fair value disclosures for financial instruments. Certain financial
instruments, particularly policyholder liabilities other than investment-type contracts, are excluded from these fair value disclosure requirements. The techniques utilized in estimating
the fair values of financial instruments are affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows. Care should be exercised in
deriving conclusions about our business, its value or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below. The estimates shown are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a one-time, current market exchange of all of our financial instruments.

We
define fair value as the quoted market prices for those instruments that are actively traded in financial markets. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are estimated using present value or other valuation techniques. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about the financial
instrument, including estimates of timing, amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties. Such estimates do not consider the tax impact of the realization of
unrealized gains or losses. In many cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets. In addition, the disclosed fair value may not be realized in the
immediate settlement of the financial instrument.

Fair
values of public debt and equity securities have been determined by us from public quotations, when available. Private placement securities and other fixed maturities and equity
securities are valued by discounting the expected total cash flows. Market rates used are applicable to the yield, credit quality and average maturity of each security.

Fair
values of commercial mortgage loans are determined by discounting the expected total cash flows using market rates that are applicable to the yield, credit quality and maturity of
each loan.

The
fair values for assets classified as policy loans, other investments excluding equity investments in subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and accrued investment income in the
accompanying consolidated statements of financial position approximate their carrying amounts.

The
fair values of our reserves and liabilities for investment-type insurance contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on current interest rates
being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the investment-type contracts being valued. Investment-type insurance contracts include
insurance, annuity and other policy contracts that do not involve significant mortality or morbidity risk and that are only a portion of the policyholder liabilities appearing in the consolidated
statements of financial position. Insurance contracts include insurance, annuity and other policy contracts that do involve significant mortality or morbidity risk. The fair values for our insurance
contracts, other than investment-type contracts, are not required to be disclosed. We do consider, however, the various insurance and investment risks in choosing investments for both
insurance and investment-type contracts.

Fair
values for debt issues are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on our incremental borrowing rate for similar borrowing arrangements.

The
carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments were as follows:

17.    Statutory Insurance Financial Information

Principal Life, the largest indirect subsidiary of Principal Financial Group, Inc., prepares statutory financial statements in accordance with the
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa (the "State of Iowa"). The State of Iowa recognizes only statutory accounting
practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Iowa for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company to determine its solvency under the Iowa
Insurance Law. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' ("NAIC")

Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual

has been adopted as a component
of prescribed or permitted practices by the State of Iowa. The Commissioner has the right to permit other specific practices that deviate from prescribed practices.

In
2003, Principal Life received written approval from the State of Iowa to recognize as admitted assets those assets pledged by Principal Life on behalf of a wholly owned subsidiary
instead of nonadmitting such assets. At December 31, 2003, the statutory surplus of Principal Life was $707.0 million greater than it would have been if NAIC Statutory Accounting
Principles had been followed for this transaction. This permitted practice has no effect on Principal Life's net income for the years then ended. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no
pledged assets on behalf of a wholly owned subsidiary.

Life
and health insurance companies are subject to certain risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements as specified by the NAIC. Under those requirements, the amount of capital
and surplus maintained by a life and health insurance company is to be determined based on the various risk factors related to it. At December 31, 2005, Principal Life meets the minimum RBC
requirements.

Statutory
net income and statutory surplus of Principal Life were as follows:

18.    Segment Information

We provide financial products and services through the following segments: U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation, International Asset Management and Accumulation
and Life and Health Insurance. In addition, there is a Mortgage Banking (discontinued operations) and Corporate and Other segment. The segments are managed and reported separately because they provide
different products and services, have different strategies or have different markets and distribution channels.

The
U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment provides retirement and related financial products and services primarily to businesses, their employees and other individuals and
provides asset management services to our asset accumulationbusiness, the life and health insurance operations, the Corporate and Other segment and third-party clients.

The
International Asset Management and Accumulation segment consists of Principal International operations in Chile, Mexico, Hong Kong, Brazil, India, China, and Malaysia. We focus on
countries with favorable demographics and a trend toward private sector defined contribution pension systems. We entered these countries through acquisitions, start-up operations and joint
ventures.

The
Life and Health insurance segment provides individual life insurance, group health insurance and specialty benefits, which consists of group dental and vision insurance, individual
and group disability insurance and group life insurance, throughout the United States.

On
July 1, 2004, we closed the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. to CitiMortgage, Inc. The results of operations (excluding corporate overhead) for our
Mortgage Banking segment, which includes Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., are reported as other after-tax adjustments for all periods presented. See Note 3, Discontinued
Operations, for further explanation.

The
Corporate and Other segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate and Other segment primarily
reflect our financing activities (including interest expense), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other
after-tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

18.    Segment Information — (continued)

Management
uses segment operating earnings for goal setting, determining employee compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts. We
determine segment operating earnings by adjusting U.S. GAAP net income available to common stockholders for net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other
after-tax adjustments which management believes are not indicative of overall operating trends. Net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, are net of income taxes,
related changes in the amortization pattern of DPAC and sales inducements, recognition of front-end fee revenues for sales charges on pension products and services, net realized capital
gains and losses distributed, minority interest capital gains and losses and certain market value adjustments to fee revenues. Segment operating revenues exclude net realized/unrealized capital gains
and their impact on recognition of front-end fee revenues and certain market value adjustments to fee revenues. While these items may be significant components in understanding and
assessing the consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of segment operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting earnings
attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the business.

The
accounting policies of the segments are consistent with the accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of income tax allocation. The Corporate
and Other segment functions to absorb the risk inherent in interpreting and applying tax law. The segments are allocated tax adjustments consistent with the positions we took on tax returns. The
Corporate and Other segment results reflect any differences between the tax returns and the estimated resolution of any disputes.

19.    Stock-Based Compensation Plans

As of December 31, 2005, we have the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, the Stock Incentive Plan,
the Directors Stock Plan and the Long Term Performance Plan. As of May 17, 2005, no new grants will be made under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Directors Stock Plan or the Long Term Performance
Plan.

Under
the terms of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, grants may be nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, or other stock based awards. Total options granted under the Stock Incentive Plan and the
2005 Stock Incentive Plan were 2.7 million, 2.4 million and 2.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Options outstanding under the Stock Incentive Plan and the 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan were granted at a price equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and expire ten years after the grant date. Options granted have graded or cliff vesting over
a three-year period.

Restricted
stock units were issued to certain employees and agents pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan and 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, 0.4 million,
0.3 million and 0.3 million restricted stock units were granted, respectively. The weighted-average award prices were $39.50, $36.32 and $32.33 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Units awarded have graded or cliff vesting over a three-year period.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

19.    Stock-Based Compensation Plans — (continued)

In
2004 and 2003, stock appreciation rights were issued to agents meeting certain production requirements. The stock appreciation rights vest ratably over a
three-year-period. We granted 28,466 and 26,727 stock appreciation rights during 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we
recorded compensation expense of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, related to the stock appreciation rights.

The
2005 Directors Stock Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or other stock-based awards to our nonemployee directors.
This plan supercedes a previously existing plan with substantially similar terms and, upon its approval by stockholders on May 17, 2005, no new grants will be made under the Directors Stock
Plan. The total number of shares to be issued under the 2005 Directors Stock Plan may not exceed 500,000 shares. Options granted under the Directors stock plans have an exercise price equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant and a term equal to the earlier of five years from the date the participant ceases to provide service or the tenth anniversary of the
date the option was granted. Since no options were to become exercisable for directors earlier than eighteen months following October 26, 2001, the date of demutualization, option grants made
in 2002 under this plan cliff-vested one year from grant date. Beginning with the 2003 grant, options become exercisable in four approximately equal installments on the three, six and nine month
anniversaries of the grant date, and on the date that the Director's full term of office expires. Options granted under this plan amounted to 22,620 and 25,155 options in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
There were no options granted in 2005.

Beginning
in 2005, pursuant to the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, restricted stock units are now granted to each director in office immediately following each annual meeting of stockholders
and to each person who becomes a member of the Board other than on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. Prior to this time, awards of restricted stock units were granted pursuant to the
Directors Stock Plan on the date of each Board member's election or re-election date. In 2005, 24,640 restricted stock units were issued at a weighted-average price of $40.28. In 2004,
9,059 restricted stock units were issued at a weighted-average award price of $34.57. In 2003, 10,400 restricted stock units were issued at a weighted-average award price of $30.27. Restrictions on
the sale or transfer of restricted stock units shall lapse on the scheduled date of the first annual meeting of the stockholders scheduled to occur after the date such restricted stock units are
granted for the 2005 awards, and lapse in installments from the date of grant to the date of the end of the directors' term for prior awards. When service to the Company ceases, all vesting stops and
unvested units are forfeited. The unamortized deferred compensation was $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

We
also maintain the Long Term Performance Plan, which provides the opportunity for eligible executives to receive additional rewards if specified minimum corporate performance
objectives are achieved over a three-year period. This plan was amended in May 2001, to utilize stock as an option for payment starting with payments in 2003. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded compensation expense of $9.6 million, $5.1 million and $7.1 million, respectively, related to the plan. Effective with
stockholder approval of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, any awards earned under the Long Term Performance Plan will be issued under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.

As
of December 31, 2004, the maximum number of shares of common stock that were available for grant under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Directors Stock Plan, and the Long Term
Performance Plan was 13.4 million. As of December 31, 2005, the number of shares available for grant under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2005 Directors Stock Plan was
24.5 million.

Under
our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, participating employees have the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock on a quarterly basis. For 2003, the maximum amount an employee
could contribute during any plan year was the lesser of $10,000, or such greater or lesser amount as determined by the plan administrator, and 10% of the employee's salary. Effective January 1,
2004, employees may purchase up to $25,000 worth of company stock each year. Employees may purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the share's fair market value as of the
beginning or end of the quarter, whichever is lower. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, employees purchased 0.7 million, 0.8 million, and 0.6 million shares during 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, an additional 25,312, 22,838, and 14,634 shares, respectively, were purchased from dividends and reinvested into participants' accounts.

The
maximum number of shares of common stock that we may issue under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is 2% of the number of shares outstanding immediately following the completion of
the Initial Public Offering. As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, a total of 4.0 million, 4.7 million, and 5.5 million shares, respectively, are available to be made
issuable by us for this plan.

19.    Stock-Based Compensation Plans — (continued)

The
compensation cost that has been charged against income for the Stock Incentive Plan, Directors Stock Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan was $42.6 million,
$42.4 million, and $22.7 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For awards with graded vesting, we use an accelerated expense attribution method.

The
weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model was $9.18, $13.56, and $10.66 per share,
respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions:

22.    Condensed Consolidating Financial Information

Principal Life has established special purpose entities to issue secured medium-term notes. Under the program, the payment obligations of principal
and interest on the notes are secured by funding agreements issued by Principal Life. Principal Life's payment obligations on the funding agreements are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
Principal Financial Group, Inc. All of the outstanding stock of Principal Life is indirectly owned by Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Principal Financial Group, Inc. is the
only guarantor of the payment obligations of the funding agreements.

We
received a subpoena on March 31, 2005 from the Attorney General of West Virginia for documents and other information relating to funding agreement-backed securities, special
purpose vehicles related to funding agreement-backed securities, and related subjects. A response has been sent. We understand that other U.S.-based life insurers that have funding agreement-backed
note programs such as our on-going programs have received similar subpoenas from the Attorney General of West Virginia. Other than the subpoena, we have received no notification of any
pending or threatened investigation or other proceeding by West Virginia governmental authorities involving funding agreement-backed securities.

On June 30, 2004, our shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission was declared effective. Following our June 2005
issuance of perpetual preferred stock under the shelf registration, we now have the ability to issue up to $2.45 billion of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock
purchase contracts and stock purchase units of Principal Financial Group, Inc. and trust preferred securities of three subsidiary trusts. If we issue additional securities, we intend to use the
proceeds from the sale of the securities offered by the prospectus, including the corresponding junior subordinated debentures issued to the trusts in connection with their investment of all the
proceeds from the sale of preferred securities, for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, investments in subsidiaries, share repurchase, acquisitions and
refinancing of debt, including commercial paper and other short-term indebtedness. Principal Financial Services, Inc. unconditionally guarantees our obligations with respect to one
or more series of debt securities described in the shelf registration statement.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Principal Financial Group, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer, J. Barry Griswell, and our Chief Financial Officer, Michael H.
Gersie, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in

Internal Controls —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management has concluded that Principal Financial
Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005.

Ernst &
Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K,
has issued an attestation report regarding internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report is included in Item 8., "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In order to ensure that the information that we must disclose in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, we
have adopted disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file with or submit to the SEC is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our
Chief Executive Officer, J. Barry Griswell, and our Chief Financial Officer, Michael H. Gersie, have reviewed and evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2005, and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Schedules

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

We
have audited the consolidated financial statements of Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("the Company") as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2005, and have issued our report thereon dated February 16, 2006 (included elsewhere in this Form 10-K). Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15.a.2. of this Form 10-K. These schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion based on our audits.

In
our opinion, the financial statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in response to new accounting standards, the Company changed its methods of
accounting for variable interest entities effective July 1, 2003, certain fixed and variable contract features effective January 1, 2004, and certain non-monetary exchanges
of similar productive assets (primarily real estate) effective July 1, 2005.

amount shown in the Statement of Financial Position for mortgage loans differs from cost as mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method, and net of valuation allowances.

(2)

The
amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position for real estate differ from cost due to properties which were determined to be impaired. The cost bases of these properties

properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners. Other investments also includes derivatives and certain seed money investments, which are reported at fair value.
