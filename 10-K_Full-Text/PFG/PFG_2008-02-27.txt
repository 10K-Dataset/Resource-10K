PART I

Item 1.    Business

The Principal Financial Group is a leading provider of retirement savings, investment and insurance products and services with $311.1 billion in assets
under management ("AUM") and approximately nineteen million customers worldwide as of December 31, 2007.

Our
U.S. and international operations concentrate primarily on asset accumulation and asset management. In addition, we offer a broad range of individual and group life insurance, group
health insurance, individual and group disability insurance and group dental and vision insurance.

We
primarily focus on small and medium-sized businesses, which we define as companies with less than 1,000 employees, providing a broad array of retirement and employee benefit solutions
to meet the needs of the business, the business owner and their employees. With over 32,000 plans, we are the leading provider of corporate defined contribution plans in the U.S., according to
Spectrem Group. We are also the leading employee stock ownership plan consultant. In addition, we are a leading provider of nonqualified plans, defined benefit plans and plan termination annuities. We
are also one of the largest providers of non-medical insurance product solutions.

We
believe small and medium-sized businesses are an underserved market, offering attractive growth opportunities in the U.S. in retirement services and other employee benefits. We also
believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage our U.S. retirement expertise into select international markets that have adopted or are moving toward private sector defined contribution
pension systems. This opportunity is particularly compelling as aging populations around the world are driving increased demand for retirement accumulation, retirement asset management and retirement
income management solutions.

Our Reportable Segments

Our segment results have been modified to reflect a change in the composition of our reportable segments. Prior to 2007, amounts now reported in the U.S. Asset
Accumulation and Global Asset Management segments were reported together in the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment. We now organize our businesses into the following reportable segments:

•

U.S.
Asset Accumulation;

•

Global
Asset Management;

•

International
Asset Management and Accumulation; and

•

Life
and Health Insurance.

We
also have a Corporate and Other segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment.

See
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 19, Segment Information" for financial results of our segments,
including our operating revenues for our products and services described in each of the subsequent segment discussions.

U.S. Asset Accumulation Segment

Our asset accumulation activities in the U.S. date back to the 1940s when we first began providing pension plan products and services. We now offer a
comprehensive portfolio of asset accumulation products and services for retirement savings and investment:

•

To
businesses of all sizes with a concentration on small and medium-sized businesses, we offer products and services for defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k)
and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans, non-qualified executive benefit plans and employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") consulting services. For more basic investment needs, we
offer SIMPLE IRA and payroll deduction plans;

•

To
large institutional clients, we also offer investment-only products, including guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs") and funding agreements; and

•

To
employees of businesses and other individuals, we offer the ability to accumulate funds for retirement and savings through mutual funds, individual annuities and bank
products.

We
organize our U.S. asset accumulation operations into six product and service categories: full service accumulation, Principal Funds (our mutual fund business), individual annuities,
bank and trust services, investment only and full service payout.


Full Service Accumulation

Products

We offer a wide variety of investment and administrative products for defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit
pension plans, non-qualified executive benefit plans and ESOPs. A 403(b) plan is a plan described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides retirement benefits
for employees of tax-exempt organizations and public schools.

Full
service accumulation products respond to the needs of plan sponsors seeking both administrative and investment services for defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The
investment component of both the defined contribution and defined benefit plans may be in the form of a general account, separate account or a mutual fund offering.

As
of December 31, 2007, we provided full service accumulation products to 33,053 defined contribution pension plans, of which 27,076 were 401(k) plans, covering
3.1 million plan participants, and to 2,745 defined benefit pension plans, covering 339,356 plan participants. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 70% of our full service accumulation
account values were managed by Principal Global Investors. Third-party asset managers provide asset management services with respect to the remaining assets.

We
deliver both administrative and investment services to our defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan customers through annuities and mutual funds. Annuities and the
underlying investment options are not required to be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Our mutual fund offering is
called Principal Advantage. It is a qualified plan product based on our series mutual fund, Principal Investors Fund, and is a registered product with the SEC. We offer investments covering the full
range of stable value, equity, fixed income and international investment options managed by our affiliated asset manager, Principal Global Investors, as well as third-party asset managers.

Markets and Distribution

We offer our full service accumulation products and services to employer-sponsored pension plans, including qualified and non-qualified defined
contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Our primary target market is plans sponsored by small and medium-sized businesses, which we believe remains under-penetrated. According to Spectrem Group,
in 2006, only 15% of businesses with between 5 and 99 employees, and 47% of businesses with between 100 and 500 employees, offered a 401(k) plan. The same study indicates that 63% of employers with
between 500 and 1,000 employees; 71% of employers with between 1,000 and 5,000 employees; and 90% of employers with 5,000 or more employees offered a 401(k) plan in 2006.

We
distribute our full service accumulation products and services nationally, primarily through a captive retirement services sales force. As of December 31, 2007, approximately
315 retirement services sales representatives in over 42 offices, operating as a wholesale distribution network, maintained relationships with over 8,810 independent brokers, consultants and agents.
Retirement services sales representatives are an integral part of the sales process alongside the referring consultant or independent broker. We compensate retirement services sales representatives
through a blend of salary and production-based incentives, while we pay independent brokers, consultants and agents a commission or fee.

As
of December 31, 2007, we had a separate staff of over 222 service and education specialists located in the sales offices who play a key role in the ongoing servicing of pension
plans by: providing local services to our customers, such as reviewing plan performance, investment options and plan design; communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us; and helping
employees understand the benefits of their pension plans. The following summarizes our distribution channels:

•

We
distribute our annuity-based products through sales representatives, agents and brokers who are primarily state licensed individuals.

•

Principal
Advantage, our mutual fund-based product, is targeted at defined contribution plans through broker/dealer distribution channels. Principal Advantage
gives us access to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (formerly known as the National Association of Securities Dealers)-registered distributors who are not traditional sellers of annuity-based
products and broadens opportunities for us in the investment advisor and broker-dealer distribution channels.

•

Principal
Security Builder Retirement Program Individual 401(k) is the newest retirement plan solution from the Principal Financial Group. It was created for the small
business owner giving them a low-cost retirement program that allows them to save on taxes while saving for retirement. The Principal Security Builder Retirement Program Individual 401(k)
is available through the group annuity contract.

•

Through
our Retire Secure strategy we provide financial education and assistance to individual investors who are participants/members of employer-based accumulation
solutions to help them achieve financial security.


We
believe that our approach to full service accumulation plan services distribution gives us a local sales and service presence that differentiates us from many of our competitors. We
have also recently established a number of marketing and distribution relationships to increase the sales of our accumulation products with firms such as Bank of America and Smith Barney.

Principal Funds

We have been providing mutual funds to customers since 1969. We offer mutual funds to individuals, businesses and institutional investors for use within variable
life and variable annuity contracts, for use in employer-sponsored pension plans, as a rollover investment option, and for general investment purposes.

Products and Services

We were ranked in the top quartile among U.S. mutual fund managers in terms of total mutual fund AUM as of December 31, 2007, according to the Investment
Company Institute ("ICI"). At $63.5 billion in AUM, we rank 41 out of 330 according to the ICI. We provide accounting, compliance, corporate governance and product development for all mutual
funds we organize. As of December 31, 2007, our mutual fund operations served approximately 1.9 million mutual fund shareholder accounts.

Principal Investors Fund.

Principal Investors Fund is a series mutual fund, which as of
December 31, 2007, offered 68 investment options. This fund acts as the funding vehicle for Principal Advantage, the defined contribution product described above under "U.S. Asset Accumulation
Segment-Full Service Accumulation Products." This fund also offers retail classes of shares to individuals for IRA rollovers ("J shares") and general investment purposes (A, B and C
shares) and a class of shares ("I shares") offered primarily to specified institutional investors. As of December 31, 2007, the J share retail class of shares had $5.0 billion in AUM;
$1.6 billion of the retail AUM invests in other share classes of Principal Investors Funds. All other share classes of Principal Investors Funds, including seed money, had $51.3 billion
of AUM. We report the results for this fund, excluding the retail AUM, under "Full Service Accumulation." We report the results of the retail assets under "Principal Funds."

Principal Variable Contracts Fund.

Principal Variable Contracts Fund is a series mutual fund, which,
as of December 31, 2007, provided 40 investment options for use as funding choices in variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by Principal Life Insurance Company
("Principal Life") and other insurance companies. As of December 31, 2007, this fund had $7.2 billion in AUM. AUM backing Principal Life variable annuity contracts is reported in this
segment under "Individual Annuities." AUM backing Principal Life variable life insurance contracts is reported in the Life and Health Insurance segment.

Principal Managed Portfolio.

Principal Managed Portfolio is a wrap product offered by our registered
investment advisor, Princor Financial Services Corporation ("Princor"), which only invests in Principal Investors Funds. We started to market this product in mid-2005. Clients are charged
a quarterly asset-based fee on this account. As of December 31, 2007, Principal Managed Portfolio had accumulated $676.0 million in assets.

Principal Advisory Select.

Principal Advisory Select Program is an investment advisory program that
permits the client to invest in a broad array of investments and is a non-discretionary investment advisory program. Clients are charged a quarterly asset-based fee on this account. As of
December 31, 2007, Principal Advisory Select had accumulated $1.2 billion in assets.

WM Advisors, Inc.

On December 31, 2006, we completed the purchase of WM
Advisors, Inc. and its subsidiaries from Washington Mutual, Inc. for a total cost of $741.1 million in cash at the time of closing. WM Advisors, Inc. was the manager of the
WM Funds, a family of 40 retail mutual funds and variable trust funds. As of December 31, 2006, the WM Funds acquired had $22.5 billion in AUM. During 2007, the WM Funds were integrated
into the Principal Investors Fund and Principal Variable Contracts Fund.

Markets and Distribution

Our markets for retail mutual funds are individuals seeking to accumulate savings for retirement and other purposes and small businesses seeking to use mutual
funds as the funding vehicle for pension plans, as well as non-qualified individual savings plans utilizing payroll deductions. We also market our retail mutual funds to participants in
pension plans who are departing their plans and reinvesting their retirement assets into individual retirement accounts.

Our
retail mutual funds are sold primarily through our affiliated financial representatives, independent brokers registered with our securities broker-dealer, Princor, registered
representatives from other broker-dealers, direct deposits from our employees and others and Principal Connection. Princor recruits, trains and supervises registered representatives selling our
products. With the WM Advisors, Inc. acquisition, we obtained established relationships with a number of marketing and outside broker dealer distributors to increase the sales of our mutual
fund products.


Individual Annuities

Individual annuities offer a tax-deferred means of accumulating retirement savings, as well as a tax-efficient source of income during the
payout period.

Products

We offer both fixed and variable annuities to individuals and pension plans. Individual annuities may be categorized in two ways: (1) deferred, in which
case assets accumulate until the contract is surrendered, the customer dies or the customer begins receiving benefits under an annuity payout option, or (2) immediate/payout, in which case
payments begin within one year of issue and continue for a fixed period of time or for life.

Fixed Deferred Annuities.

Our individual fixed deferred annuities consist of both single premium
deferred annuity contracts and flexible premium deferred annuity contracts ("FPDAs"). Some FPDA contracts limit the period of time deposits are allowed (i.e., only one year). For most
contracts, the principal amount is guaranteed. We credit the customer's account with a fixed interest rate and for a specified time period, typically one, three or five years. Thereafter, we reset,
typically annually, the interest rate credited to the contract based upon our discretion, taking into account market and other conditions. We also offer a fixed deferred annuity where the interest
credited is linked to an external equity index, subject to maximum and minimum values. Our major source of income from fixed deferred annuities is the spread between the investment income earned on
the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited to the contracts. We bear the investment risk because, while we credit customers' accounts with a stated interest rate, we cannot
be certain the investment income we earn on our general account assets will exceed that rate. Principal Global Investors manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Variable Deferred Annuities.

Individual variable deferred annuities are savings vehicles through
which the customer makes one or more deposits of varying amounts and intervals. Customers have the flexibility to allocate their deposits to investment sub-accounts managed by Principal
Global Investors, or other third-party asset managers. As of December 31, 2007, 66% of our $5.3 billion in variable annuity account balances was allocated to investment
sub-accounts and our general account, which are managed by Principal Global Investors and 34% to investment sub-accounts managed by third-party asset managers. Generally
speaking, the customers bear the investment risk and have the right to allocate their assets among various separate investment sub-accounts. The value of the annuity fluctuates in
accordance with the experience of the investment sub-accounts chosen by the customer. Customers have the option to allocate all or a portion of their account to our general account, in
which case we credit interest at rates we determine, subject to contractual minimums. Customers may also elect an enhanced death benefit guarantee (commonly known in the industry as a guaranteed
minimum death benefit, or "GMDB") and/or a living benefit guarantee (commonly known in the industry as a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or "GMWB"). The GMWB feature became available in 2005.
Our major source of revenue from variable annuities is mortality and expense fees we charge to the customer, generally determined as a percentage of the market value of the assets held in a separate
investment sub-account.

Fixed Immediate Annuities.

Our individual fixed immediate annuities consist almost exclusively of
single premium immediate annuity contracts ("SPIAs"). SPIAs are products where the customer makes a single deposit, and from which periodic benefit payments are made. Payments may be contingent upon
the survival of one or two individuals, or payments may be fixed, meaning payments are contractually guaranteed and do not depend on the continuing survival of any individual. Our major source of
income from fixed immediate annuities is the spread between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate implied in the calculation of annuity benefit
payments. We bear the investment risk because we cannot be certain the investment income we earn on our general account assets will exceed the rate implied in the SPIA contracts. Principal Global
Investors manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Markets and Distribution

Our target markets for individual annuities include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses, and individuals seeking to accumulate
and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market both fixed and variable annuities to both qualified and non-qualified pension plans.

We
sell our individual annuity products through our affiliated financial representatives, who accounted for 26%, 40% and 43% of annuity sales for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The remaining sales were made through banks, brokerage general agencies, mutual fund companies, Principal Connection and unaffiliated broker-dealer firms. Although
the overall percentage of sales from affiliated financial representatives has declined, they continued to be the primary distribution channel of our variable deferred annuities. The overall percentage
decline is a result of focused efforts to increase fixed annuity sales through non-affiliated distribution channels.

Bank and Trust Services

Bank and trust services include Principal Bank and Principal Trust Company. Principal Bank, our electronic banking operation, is a federal savings bank that began
its activities in February 1998. We offer flexible banking products and


services
via the telephone, Internet, ATM or by mail. Our current products and services include a consumer suite of checking and savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit,
consumer loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, debit cards, small account rollovers from qualified retirement plans and health savings accounts. In addition, we offer
deposit and loan services to small and medium-sized businesses. As of December 31, 2007, Principal Bank had approximately 181,000 customers and approximately $1.9 billion in assets.

We
market our Principal Bank products and services to prospects and our existing customers, through Principal Connection and other means such as the Internet, direct mail and targeted
advertising, with a primary focus on deepening existing relationships with customers of Principal Bank and Principal Financial Group, Inc. Through Principal Bank, we also pursue asset retention
strategies with our customers who seek to transfer assets from our other asset accumulation products by offering them our banking products and services.

Principal
Trust Company is a Delaware state chartered non-deposit trust company. Principal Trust Company, chartered in 1899 as Delaware Charter Guarantee and Trust Company,
is one of the largest non-deposit trust companies in the nation. As of December 31, 2007, we served as trustee to over 300,000 accounts and held assets in excess of
$65 billion. Principal Trust Company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans.

Principal
Trust Company specializes in providing affordable and innovative trust solutions directed at self-directed tax-advantaged savings accounts, such as
Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs"), Health Savings Accounts ("HSAs") and a full array of employee benefit plans and accounts including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans,
non-qualified executive benefit plans and ESOPs. We provide these services to Principal affiliates, brokerage firms, clearing firms, financial advisors and asset managers.

Investment Only

Products

The three primary products for which we provide investment only services are: GICs; funding agreements and other investment only products.

GICs
and funding agreements pay a specified rate of return. The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment only products
contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.

Deposits
to investment only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to another. Assets
invested in GICs and funding agreements generate a spread between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. Our other investment only products consist of separate
accounts invested in either equities or fixed income instruments. Principal Global Investors manages the assets supporting investment only account values.

Markets and Distribution

We market GICs and funding agreements primarily to pension plan sponsors and other institutions. We also offer them as part of our full service accumulation
products. We sell our GICs primarily to plan sponsors for funding of tax-qualified retirement plans. We sell our funding agreements directly to institutions that may or may not be pension
funds and unconsolidated special purpose vehicles domiciled either in the U.S. or offshore for funding agreement-backed note programs. The funding agreements sold as part of these funding
agreement-backed note programs work by having investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose vehicle which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms similar to those
of the debt obligations. The strength of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to another. In
addition to the special purpose vehicle selling the funding agreement-backed notes to U.S. and foreign institutional investors, the special purpose vehicle may also sell notes to U.S. retail investors
through a SEC-registered shelf debt issuance program.

Full Service Payout

Products

Full service payout products respond to the needs of pension plan participants who, upon retirement or termination of their employment, seek a guaranteed income
stream. Plan participants who seek these services include those from pension plans we service, as well as pension plans other providers service. We primarily offer single premium group annuities,
which are immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. These are available to defined contribution and defined benefit plan
participants. We make regular payments to individuals, invest the underlying assets on their behalf and provide tax reporting to them. We also reinsure single premium immediate annuities issued by
another insurer.

Single
premium group annuities are traditionally used in conjunction with defined benefit plans, particularly those where the plan is being terminated. In such instances, the plan
sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Increasingly, these products are purchased by defined contribution plan participants


who
reach retirement age. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor has mandated
that annuities be purchased only from the "safest available" insurers.

Premium
received from full service payout products are generally in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new premiums can fluctuate depending on the number of
retirements and large-scale annuity sales in a particular fiscal quarter. Principal Global Investors manages the assets supporting full service payout account values.

Markets and Distribution

Our primary distribution channel for full service payout products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants working through consultants
and brokers that specialize in this type of business. Our sales consultants also make sales directly to institutions. Our nationally dispersed retirement services sales representatives act as a
secondary distribution channel for these products. Principal Connection also distributes full service payout products to participants in plans we service who are terminating employment or retiring.
Principal Connection is our direct response distribution channel for retail financial services products to individuals. Principal Connection's services are available over the phone, on the Internet or
by mail.

Global Asset Management Segment

Our Global Asset Management segment consists of Principal Global Investors and its affiliates. We focus on providing a diverse range of asset management services
covering a broad range of asset classes, investment styles and portfolio structures to our other segments and third-party institutional clients.

As
of December 31, 2007, Principal Global Investors, together with its affiliates, Principal Real Estate Investors, Spectrum Asset Management, Post Advisory Group, Columbus Circle
Investors, Edge Asset Management and Morley Financial Services managed $236.0 billion in assets. Morley Financial Services was acquired on August 31, 2007. Edge
Asset Management was acquired on December 31, 2006 as part of the WM Advisors, Inc. acquisition. We have offices outside of the U.S. in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore and
Japan.

Products and Services

Fee Mandate Business

Our fee mandate business provides focused investment advisory services across a broad range of asset classes, investment styles and portfolio structures. These
services are provided for a fee as defined by the client mandate. We are diversified across three primary asset classes.

Equity Investments.

Circle Investors and Edge Asset Management managed $68.1 billion in global equity assets. Our equity capabilities encompass large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap

and the remaining 24% from third-party institutional clients.

Fixed Income Investments.

Principal Global Investors, along with Spectrum Asset Management, Post
Advisory Group, Edge Asset Management and Morley Financial Services managed $122.5 billion in global fixed income assets as of December 31, 2007. Collectively, we provide our clients
with access to investment-grade corporate debt, government bonds, mortgage-backed, asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities, high yield and municipal bonds, private and syndicated debt
instruments and preferred securities. As of December 31, 2007, 33% of these assets were derived from our pension products, 23% from other products of the Principal Financial Group, and the
remaining 44% from third-party institutional clients.

Real Estate Investments.

Principal Global Investors, through its affiliate Principal Real Estate
Investors, managed a portfolio of primarily U.S. commercial real estate assets of $43.7 billion as of December 31, 2007. Principal Real Estate Investors provides our clients with a broad
range of real estate investment options, including private real estate equity, commercial mortgages, credit tenant debt, construction-permanent financing, bridge/mezzanine loans, commercial
mortgage-backed securities and real estate investment trusts. As of December 31, 2007, 36% of the commercial real estate portfolio was derived from our pension products, 25% from other products
of the Principal Financial Group and the remaining 39% from third-party institutional clients.

Spread and Securitization Business

We also have spread and securitization businesses. Principal Commercial Acceptance offers commercial real estate niche financing opportunities, including
bridge/mezzanine loans and land loans. We had $0.4 billion of bridge/mezzanine loans as of December 31, 2007. Principal Commercial Funding in partnership with Principal Real Estate
Investors historically had originated commercial mortgage loans, warehoused pool loans and facilitated the issuance of mortgage-backed securities. In 2005, Principal Real Estate Investors and U.S.
Bank National Association, the principal banking


subsidiary
of U.S. Bancorp, created Principal Commercial Funding II, a jointly-owned business that competes in the commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") market. This company is the CMBS
platform for both Principal Real Estate Investors and U.S. Bank National Association and focuses on securitizing commercial mortgages originated by both Principal Real Estate Investors and U.S. Bank
National Association on their behalf. Principal Commercial Funding II started contributing collateral to securitizations during the first quarter of 2006.

Markets and Distribution

We employed 122 institutional sales, relationship management and client service professionals as of December 31, 2007, who worked with consultants and
directly with large investors to acquire and retain third-party institutional clients. As of December 31, 2007, Principal Global Investors and its affiliates have approximately 460 third-party
institutional clients with $87.3 billion of AUM in 25 countries.

International Asset Management and Accumulation Segment

Our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment consists of Principal International, which has operations in Brazil, Chile, China, Hong Kong, India,
Malaysia and Mexico. We focus on countries with favorable demographics and growing long-term savings and defined contribution markets. We entered these countries through acquisitions,
start-up operations and joint ventures.

The
activities of Principal International reflect our efforts to accelerate the growth of our AUM by capitalizing on the international trend toward private sector defined contribution
pension systems and individual long-term savings. Through Principal International, we offer retirement products and services, annuities, mutual funds, institutional asset management and
life insurance accumulation products.

Products, Markets and Distribution

Brazil.

In Brazil we offer pension, retirement and asset accumulation products through a
minority-held joint venture arrangement with Banco do Brasil, which has a 3,977 branch network. We are Banco do Brasil's exclusive partner for distributing pension, retirement and
long-term asset accumulation products. Our joint venture provides defined contribution products, complementary life protection and annuities for the retirement needs of employers and
individuals. Banco do Brasil's employees sell these products directly to individual clients through its bank branches. In addition, our joint venture reaches corporate clients through two wholesale
distribution channels: (1) a network of independent brokers who sell to the public, and (2) Banco do Brasil's corporate account executives selling to existing corporate clients. Based
upon managed assets, our joint venture ranked third in the private pension market as of December 2007.

Chile.

In Chile we offer long-term savings products, retirement annuities, mutual funds,
life insurance accumulation products, mortgage loans and institutional asset management services.

We
offer retirement annuities to individuals exiting the pre-retirement accumulation system. We distribute our annuity products through a network of brokers and independent
agents, of which we had 163 as of December 31, 2007.

We
serve the voluntary/complementary long-term savings market by offering "APV plans" (qualified individual solutions). As of September 30, 2007, we ranked first in
AUM for mutual fund companies offering these plans. We distribute to retail clients through our proprietary sales force, alliances with financial institutions and the largest retailer in Chile,
Falabella.

In
addition, we market life insurance accumulation products (qualified and non-qualified) to individuals through brokers; originate, sell and service individual residential
mortgage loans in Chile through our proprietary sales force; and offer asset management services to institutional investors and family businesses through our proprietary staff.

China.

In China we market mutual funds through a minority-held joint venture with China
Construction Bank ("CCB"). We sell mutual funds primarily through our partner bank, CCB. This bank delivers expansive distribution capabilities for the joint venture in terms of brand awareness and
the number of outlets, of which we had 13,000 as of December 31, 2007.

Hong Kong.

In Hong Kong we sell defined contribution, mutual fund and institutional asset management
products.

We
have subsidiaries in Hong Kong that actively compete in the defined contribution pension plan market. The government requires both employers and employees to contribute 5% of an
employee's income to a Mandatory Provident Fund. We target small and medium-sized employers and distribute products through strategic alliances with insurance companies, mutual funds or banks, direct
marketing and through our own sales representatives. Our strategic partners distribute our Mandatory Provident Fund products and services, or use our administrative and investment services in their
own products.


We compete in the Hong Kong mutual fund market distributed primarily through strategic alliances with banks to retail customers. In addition, we have initiated our development of an
institutional asset management business distributed primarily through strategic alliances with banks to retail customers.

India.

In India we offer mutual funds, insurance brokerage and institutional asset management
products.

We
compete in the mutual fund market, managing and administering funds for both individuals and corporations. We sell our mutual funds through regional offices and regional bank branches
located throughout India. In addition to the current mutual fund business, we are positioning ourselves to compete in the emerging pension and long-term savings market in India.

We
have a joint venture agreement with Punjab National Bank ("PNB") and Vijaya Bank, two large Indian commercial banks with a combined branch network of approximately 5,000, to sell
mutual funds and related financial services in India.

We
have a stake in a company that is a distributor of financial products including mutual fund products for other providers, bonds, retail debt offerings and portfolio management
services.

We
also have a stake and management control of an insurance brokerage company in India. We broker insurance products through regional offices and regional bank branches located
throughout India.

Discussions
are taking place with our partners to review the optimal ownership and organizational structure for the future, including distribution.

Malaysia.

In Malaysia we offer conventional and Islamic mutual funds through our
minority-held joint venture with CIMB Group, a large Malaysian bank holding company with a presence in many southeast Asian countries. The company markets mutual funds through wholesale
bank channels and its own sales force of around 5,000 agents. The joint venture's main bank channel is through the 380 CIMB Bank branches. As of September 30, 2007, our joint venture company
ranked third in unit trust assets managed and second in Islamic unit trust assets managed in the Malaysian asset management industry. In addition, the company manages a significant amount of
institutional asset mandates ranking first among asset management companies as of September 30, 2007. The joint venture began an asset management start-up operation in Singapore,
CIMB-Principal
Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd, in 2007 and acquired a small asset management operation in Indonesia, PT Niaga Aset Manajem.

Mexico.

In Mexico we offer defined contribution pension products, mutual funds, annuities and asset
management services to institutional clients.

Through
our private pension company, we manage and administer more than 3 million individual retirement accounts under the mandatory privatized social security system for all
non-government employees in Mexico. We distribute products and services through a proprietary sales force of sales representatives, of which we had approximately 2,000 as of
December 31, 2007, as well as independent brokers, who sell directly to individuals.

Through
our mutual fund company, we distribute products and services through a sales force of approximately 100 employees and through distribution agreements with other financial
entities. We administer annuities and life products that complement these annuities, which we previously distributed directly to customers who were exiting the pre-retirement accumulation
system. We have temporarily suspended sales of our annuity and life products in Mexico due to unfavorable market conditions.

Our
focus is on both pre-retirement and post-retirement savings plans. Mexico has also initiated institutional asset management services, offering both domestic
and international products.

Life and Health Insurance Segment

Our Life and Health Insurance segment offers (1) individual life insurance (2) group health insurance and (3) specialty benefits, which
includes group dental, group vision, group life, group long-term disability, group short-term disability and individual disability insurance throughout the U.S. We focus on
providing comprehensive insurance solutions for small and medium-sized businesses.

Individual Life Insurance

We began as an individual life insurer in 1879. Our U.S. operations administer approximately 600,000 individual life insurance policies with $113.2 billion
of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2007. As of September 30, 2007, our life insurance business was ranked 22nd in the U.S. for annualized sales according to
LIMRA.

Products and Services

We offer a variety of individual life insurance products, including universal and variable universal life insurance and term life insurance sold through
traditional retail insurance intermediaries. In addition, we have an increasing focus on using these products for nonqualified executive benefits for small and medium-sized businesses.

Nonqualified Executive Benefits.

Small and medium-sized companies are challenged with how to build
quality benefits packages for executives, how to transition the company's ownership to a partner or family member and how to save for


retirement.
In addition, executives and other key employees often have personal insurance needs. These needs are the focus of our products within the individual life insurance arena.

We
have a growing focus and expertise in providing executive life insurance benefits to companies designated by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") as S-corporations, in
addition to traditional C-corporation clients. As a growing segment of the small and medium-sized business market, S-corporations require unique plan designs that meet very
specific legal requirements.

Universal and Variable Universal Life Insurance.

Universal and variable universal life insurance
products offer life insurance protection for which both the premium and the death benefit may be adjusted by the policyholder. Universal life insurance usually includes a cash value account that
accumulates at a floating interest rate, with a minimum rate guarantee. Variable universal life insurance substitutes various investment options for the single floating interest rate of universal life
insurance.

For
the year ended December 31, 2007, 88% of individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales have come from universal and variable universal life insurance products.
Universal and variable universal life insurance represents 55% of individual life insurance premium and deposits for the year ended December 31, 2007, and 46% of individual life insurance in
force as of December 31, 2007. Variable universal life insurance products represented 41% of our universal and variable universal life insurance deposits for the year ended December 31,
2007.

After
removing expenses for a policy, we credit net deposits to an account maintained for the policyholder. For universal life contracts, the entire account balance is invested in our
general account. Interest is credited to the policyholder's account based on the earnings on general account investments. For variable universal life contracts, the policyholder may allocate the
account balance among our general account and a variety of separate account choices. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the general account in the same manner as for universal life. Net
investment performance on separate account investments is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts; the policyholder bears the investment risk. Some of our universal life and variable universal
life insurance contracts contain what are commonly referred to as "secondary" or "no-lapse" guarantee provisions. A no-lapse guarantee keeps the contract in force, even if the
contractholder's account balance is insufficient to cover all of the contract charges, provided that the contractholder has continually paid a specified minimum premium.

Traditional Life Insurance.

Traditional life insurance includes participating whole life, adjustable
life products and non-participating term life insurance products. Participating products and non-participating term life insurance products each represented 6% of our individual life insurance
annualized first year premium sales for the year ended December 31, 2007, and 28% and 26%, respectively, of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2007. Adjustable life
insurance products provide a guaranteed benefit in return for the payment of a fixed premium and allow the policyholder to reset the premium and face amount combination. Term insurance products
provide a guaranteed death benefit for a specified period of time in return for the payment of a fixed premium. Policyholder dividends are not paid on term insurance.

Group Health Insurance

We began offering group health insurance in 1941. We offer a variety of traditional group medical insurance products, consumer driven high deductible health plans
with health savings accounts, administrative services and wellness products. We provide administrative services on a fee-for-service basis for medical, dental, disability,
vision and wellness benefits.

Products and Services

Our group health insurance products described below provide appropriate interactions for members along a continuum of care management, from wellness services to
acute and chronic care and disease management programs. These programs include care management, a transplant network, chronic disease management, pre-natal assistance and
24-hour access to online health management resources such as symptom checkers, prescription drug information and provider information.

Group Health Insurance.

As of December 31, 2007, we provided group medical insurance benefits
to more than 19,000 employer customers and their 566,000 employees and dependents. Our traditional group medical insurance plans provide reimbursement of medical expenses for insured employees and
their dependents. These members are responsible for deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, HealthRisk Resource Group, LLC., we
negotiate discounts with providers on claims for which we have no other pre-arranged discount.

Our
consumer-driven health care plans offer greater flexibility for employers and more opportunity for members to take charge of their health and health care. We offer Health
Reimbursement Arrangements ("HRA") and HSAs. The Principal HRA is an employer funded benefit plan that allows the employer to design a consumer driven health care program to meet their specific needs.
The employer determines if a deductible applies before the HRA, what percentage the HRA reimburses, the maximum benefit, the ability to roll over the funds to future periods and accessibility of the
funds when employment has ended. The Principal Health Savings Account ("Principal HSA") can be funded by employers and employee members. Money can be contributed pre-tax and grows tax
free. Funds can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses tax free. The account is portable from job to job or from work to retirement. The Principal


HSA
is coupled with a high deductible health plan, typically either insured or administered by Principal Life. The Principal HSA features a checking account with a debit card and certificates of
deposit through Principal Bank and investment options through Princor Financial Services Corporation. Because of these internal resources and expertise, we are uniquely positioned to offer competitive
and high-quality health savings account plans and high deductible health plans.

Fee-for-Service.

We offer administration of group medical, dental, disability
and vision benefits on a fee-for-service basis to over 360 self-insured employers and their approximately 1.0 million employees and dependents as of
December 31, 2007. Effective September 1, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Aetna Signature Administrators to utilize their networks, which has improved our competitive position in
a number of markets.

We
also recognize the importance of promoting healthy behavior. Principal Wellness Company contributes expertise in providing wellness screenings, counseling and services to employers
and their employees, demonstrating health improvement through reduced health insurance claim costs, reduced absenteeism and increased employee productivity. This preventative focus has been integrated
into both our fully-insured and fee-for-service offerings. We provide wellness services to over 350 employers and nearly 110,000 employees.

Specialty Benefits

Specialty benefits, which includes group dental, vision and life insurance, as well as individual and group disability insurance, is an important component of the
employee benefit offering at small and medium-sized businesses. We offer traditional employer sponsored and voluntary products for group dental, vision, life and disability. We began selling our first
specialty benefit products in 1941 with group disability and group life insurance. We began selling individual disability insurance in 1952 and group dental and group vision insurance in the late
1960s.

Products and Services

Group Dental and Vision Insurance.

Group dental and vision insurance plans provide partial
reimbursement for dental and vision expenses. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 37,100 group dental and vision insurance policies in force covering nearly 1 million employee
lives. According to LIMRA, we were the 5th largest group dental insurer in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force in 2006. In addition to indemnity and PPO dental offered on both
an employer paid and voluntary basis, we offer a prepaid dental plan in Arizona through our Principal Dental Services, Inc. subsidiary.

Group Life Insurance.

Group life insurance provides coverage to employees and their dependents for a
specified period. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 53,000 group policies providing $125.2 billion of group life insurance in force to approximately 2.3 million
employee lives. According to LIMRA in 2006, we were ranked 4th in the U.S. in terms of the number of life insurance contracts in force. We currently sell traditional group life insurance that
does not provide for accumulation of cash values on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. Our group life insurance business remains focused on the traditional, annually renewable term product.
Group term life and group universal life accounted for 96% and 4% respectively of our total group life insurance in force as of December 31, 2007. We no longer market group universal life
insurance to new employer groups.

Group Disability Insurance.

Group disability insurance provides a benefit to insured employees who
become disabled. Our group disability products include both short-term and long-term disability, offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. Long-term
disability represents 63% of total group disability premium, while short-term disability represents 37% of total group disability premium. In addition, we provide disability management
services, also called rehabilitation services, to assist individuals in returning to work as quickly as possible following disability. We also work with disability claimants to improve the approval
rate of Social Security benefits, thereby reducing payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received. As of December 31, 2007, we served approximately 1.5 million
employee lives under nearly 32,000 contracts, with our group short-term disability business being ranked 4th and our group long-term disability business being ranked
6th in the U.S. as of December 31, 2006, in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force, according to LIMRA.

Individual Disability Insurance.

Individual disability insurance products provide a benefit to the
insured member in the event he/she becomes disabled. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. In addition to income replacement, we offer products to pay business overhead
expenses for a disabled business owner, and for the purchase by the other business owners of the disabled business owner's interests in the business. As of December 31, 2007, we served
approximately 114,000 individual disability policyholders, with our individual disability business being ranked 7th in the U.S. as of December 31, 2006, in terms of premium in force,
according to LIMRA.

Life and Health Markets and Distribution

For each of our products, administration and distribution channels are customized to meet customer needs and expectations for that product.

We
sell our individual life and individual disability income products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, primarily targeting owners and executives of small and medium-sized
businesses. Small and medium-sized business sales


represented
79% of individual life sales and 64% of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31, 2007, based on first year annualized premium.

We
distribute our individual insurance products through our affiliated financial representatives and independent brokers, as well as other marketing and distribution alliances.
Affiliated financial representatives were responsible for 42% of individual life insurance sales based on first year annualized premium and 18% of individual disability sales for the year ended
December 31, 2007. We had 1,114 affiliated financial representatives in 29 offices. Although they are independent contractors, we have a close tie with affiliated financial representatives and
offer them benefits, training and access to tools and expertise. To meet the needs of the various marketing channels, particularly the independent brokers, we employ wholesale
distributors — Regional Vice Presidents for individual life and Disability Income Regional Vice Presidents for individual disability. A key differentiator in the nonqualified
executive benefit sale is our Regional Vice Presidents-Nonqualified Plans, who are not only wholesalers but also consultants and subject-matter experts providing point-of-sale
support in closing cases.

We
market our group medical, life, disability, dental and vision insurance products to small and medium-sized businesses, primarily targeting our sales toward owners and human resources
professionals. We sell our group life, disability and dental products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We sell vision coverage in 48 states, plus the District of Columbia. We sell our
group medical insurance in 34 states and the District of Columbia with a focus on 13 states that we consider to have the best competitive environments. We continually adapt our products and pricing to
meet local market conditions. We market our fee-for-service capabilities to employers that self-insure their employees' benefits. We sell our
fee-for-service business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Group
insurance and fee-for-service products are distributed through independent benefit brokers, consultants, financial planners and the same channels that sell
our U.S. asset accumulation products. To reach these marketers, we employ three types of wholesale distributors: our medical sales representatives, our non-medical sales representatives
(for Specialty Benefits products) and an independent wholesale organization, Rogers Benefit Group, dedicated to marketing group medical, life, disability, dental and vision insurance products. We have
also formed a number of strategic distribution alliances with national brokerages and regional brokerage agencies.

The
non-medical group insurance market continues to see a shift to voluntary/worksite products. In keeping with this market change, which shifts the funding of such products
from the employer to the employee, we have enhanced our focus on our voluntary benefits platform. We believe the voluntary/worksite market presents growth opportunities, and we will continue to
develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.

As
of December 31, 2007, we had 125 medical and non-medical sales representatives and 123 service representatives in 40 offices. Our medical and
non-medical sales representatives accounted for 74% of our group insurance sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. The group sales force plays a key role in the ongoing
servicing of the case by providing local, responsive services to our customers and their brokers, such as renewing contracts, revising plans and solving any administrative issues; communicating the
customers' needs and feedback to us; and helping employees understand the benefits of their plans.

Rogers
Benefit Group is a marketing and service organization that represents major high quality insurance carriers specializing in group medical, life, disability and dental insurance
plans. Our relationship with Rogers Benefit Group dates back to its creation in 1970. It accounted for 24% of our group insurance sales for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Corporate and Other Segment

Our Corporate and Other segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate and
Other segment primarily reflect our financing activities (including interest expense and preferred stock dividends), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations,
income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other after-tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items.

Competition

Competition in our segments is based on a number of factors including: service, product features, price, investment performance, commission structure,
distribution capacity, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete for customers and distributors with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, mutual funds,
broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, greater diversity of distribution sources, better brand recognition
or, with respect to insurers, higher financial strength ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete or may have better investment performance at various times.

Competition
in the retirement services market is very fragmented. Our main competitors in this market include Fidelity, Nationwide, AXA, Mass Mutual and Manulife. We believe the
infrastructure and system support needed to meet the needs of the small and medium-sized business market is a significant barrier to entry for our competitors. Many of our competitors in the mutual
fund industry are larger, have been established for a longer period of time, offer less expensive products, have deeper penetration in key distribution channels and have more resources than we do.
There


were
over 8,000 mutual funds in the U.S. as of 2006 according to the Investment Company Institute 2007 Investment Company Fact Book. The institutional asset management market has grown at a rapid pace
over the last decade. Our primary competitors in this market are large institutional asset management firms, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and T. Rowe Price, some of
which offer a broader array of investment products and services and are better known. The asset management business has relatively few barriers to entry and continually attracts new entrants. The
variable annuity market is also highly competitive. As we expand into additional distribution channels for this product, we will face strong competition from Nationwide and Hartford. Competition in
the international markets in which we operate comes primarily from local financial services firms and other international companies operating on a stand-alone basis or in a partnership with local
firms, including ING, AXA, Allianz and AIG. In the highly competitive life and health insurance business, our competitors include other insurers such as UNUM, Guardian, Northwestern Mutual Life,
Manulife, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations and health maintenance organizations such as United Health Care and Aetna. We believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our:

•

full
service platform;

•

strong
customer relationships;

•

focus
on financial performance; and

•

performance-oriented
culture.

Ratings

Insurance companies are assigned financial strength ratings by rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders. Financial strength ratings are
generally defined as opinions as to an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Information about ratings provides both industry participants and
insurance consumers meaningful insights on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims.

Principal
Life has been assigned the following long-term insurance financial strength ratings:

Rating Agency

Financial Strength Rating

Rating Structure

A.M. Best Company, Inc.

A+ ("Superior") with a stable outlook

Second highest of 16 rating levels

Fitch Ratings

AA ("Very Strong") with a stable outlook

Third highest of 21 rating levels

Moody's Investors Service

Aa2 ("Excellent") with a stable outlook

Third highest of 21 rating levels

Standard & Poor's Rating Services

AA ("Very Strong") with a stable outlook

Third highest of 21 rating levels

A.M.
Best's ratings for insurance companies range from "A++" to "S". A.M. Best indicates that "A++" and "A+" ratings are assigned to those companies that in A.M. Best's
opinion have superior ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Fitch's ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "C". Fitch "AA" ratings indicate very strong capacity to meet
policyholder and contractholder obligations on a timely basis. Moody's ratings for insurance companies range from "Aaa" to "C". Moody's indicates that "Aa" ratings are assigned to those companies that
have demonstrated excellent financial security. Standard & Poor's ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "R". Standard & Poor's indicates that "AA" ratings are assigned to
those companies that have demonstrated very strong financial security characteristics. In evaluating a company's financial and operating performance, these rating agencies review its profitability,
leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its assets, the adequacy of its policy reserves, the
soundness of its risk management programs, the experience and competency of its management and other factors.

We
believe that our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to our distributors and customers, since ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally
used throughout the industry. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and are not
evaluations directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security, including our common stock.

Risk Management

Like all financial services companies, we are exposed to a wide variety of financial, operational and other risks, as described in Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
Effective enterprise risk management is, therefore, a key component of our business model. Enterprise risk management enables us to:

•

identify
and successfully manage those risks that present profitable growth opportunities, and walk away from those that do not;

•

avoid
surprises and deliver on the promises that we make; and

•

balance
the sometimes competing demands of our various stakeholders, meet our customer obligations, satisfy regulatory requirements and optimize shareholder returns relative
to the risks we take.


We
use a variety of methods to help us identify, monitor, measure, communicate and manage our risks within established limits and risk tolerances.

Our
Board of Directors and senior management are knowledgeable of and accountable for key risks. Our Board meets at least quarterly and regularly hears reports from the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the business unit Presidents, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Investment Officer. The Board has several committees, which include the Audit Committee,
the Human Resources Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, that meet at least quarterly and address various aspects of risks. In addition, the Board of Directors and senior management
receive quarterly updates from the Chief Risk Officer.

We
also have several senior management groups and committees that meet on a regular and frequent basis to discuss various issues and risks associated with our businesses. These
committees encompass numerous functions such as discussing and setting business unit and company strategy, reviewing and approving potential uses of corporate capital, and setting investment policy
and reviewing its implementation. Many key members of senior management serve on multiple committees, allowing them to provide oversight and take a holistic view of our key risks.

Our
enterprise risk management program is executed via a federated model. The Chief Risk Officer and the corporate risk units are independent of the business units, and work closely with
the business units, providing oversight and integration of all risk management activities. Each business unit is responsible for identifying, monitoring, measuring and managing its risks, as well as
monitoring how its risks impact our overall risk exposure. The business units provide risk reports to the Chief Risk Officer quarterly with current risk management information.

We
have established risk tolerances from an overall corporate perspective as well as for specific types of risks. All potentially significant actions are considered in terms of the
possible impact on our risk profile, including the capital required, the impact on near term and long-term earnings and the ability to meet our targets with respect to return on equity,
liquidity, debt/capital, cash coverage and other ratios and metrics. We monitor a variety of risk metrics on an on-going basis and make any necessary adjustments to help us stay within our
established risk tolerances. We have developed a Business Continuity Program that identifies critical business functions and includes plans for their protection and recovery in the event of a disaster
or other business interruption. We continually monitor emerging risks, and we regularly build upon our already strong risk management
practices to incorporate updated modeling tools, processes and metrics which we actively use to better understand and manage our business. We have added three new risk metrics to our enterprise risk
management framework:

•

Earnings
at Risk, which is a measure of the potential reduction in operating earnings relative to baseline operating earnings under relatively adverse business and economic
conditions.

•

Embedded
Value at Risk, which is a measure of the potential reduction in embedded value relative to baseline embedded value under relatively adverse business and economic
conditions.

•

Economic
Total Asset Requirement, which is the total assets required to ensure that we can meet all of our obligations with a high degree of confidence. Economic Total Asset
Requirement is the sum of Economic Reserves and Economic Capital.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had 16,585 employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing employment with us. We
believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.

Internet Website

Our Internet website can be found at www.principal.com. We make available free of charge on or through our Internet website, access to our annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC. Also available free of charge on our
Internet website, and in print to any requesting stockholder, is our code of business conduct and ethics, corporate governance guidelines and charters for the audit, human resources and nominating and
governance committees of our Board of Directors. Also see Item 10. "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance."


Item 1A.    Risk Factors

This section provides an overview of the risks that may impact our performance in the future. We have included the results of our sensitivity testing for risks
that can be objectively and reliably quantified. The sensitivity testing results represent hypothetical scenarios. While these scenarios do not represent our expectations of future experience, they
are intended to illustrate the potential impacts of reasonably possible hypothetical changes in experience. These sensitivities are based on our risk exposures at a point in time and may not be
representative of future results.

A decline or increased volatility in the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rates of investment, either of which
could reduce our net income, revenues and AUM.

Favorable performance by the U.S. and international securities markets increases investments in these markets and benefits our asset management and accumulation
businesses and increases our AUM. Because the revenues of our asset management businesses are, to a large extent, based on the value of AUM, a decline in these securities markets would decrease our
revenues. Turmoil in these securities markets could lead investors to withdraw from these markets, decrease their rates of investment or refrain from making new investments which may reduce our net
income, revenues and AUM. Using assumptions and data in effect as of December 31, 2007, we estimate that an immediate 10% drop in the Standard & Poors index, followed by a 2% per quarter
increase, would reduce our annual operating earnings by approximately 4% — 6%.

Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks which may diminish the value of our invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers, which could reduce
our sales, revenues, AUM and net income.

An increase in defaults on our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our profitability.

We are subject to the risk that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities we own will default on principal and interest payments, particularly if a major
downturn in economic activity occurs. As of December 31, 2007, our U.S. investment operations held $44.5 billion of fixed maturity securities, or 74% of total U.S. invested assets, of
which approximately 4.9% were below investment grade, including $48.2 million, or 0.11% of our total fixed maturity securities which we classified as either "problem," "potential problem," or
"restructured." See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — U.S. Investment
Operations — Fixed Maturity Securities." As of December 31, 2007, the international investment operations of our fully consolidated subsidiaries held $2.7 billion, or
67%, of total international invested assets in fixed maturity securities, of which 19% are government bonds. Some non-government bonds have been rated on the basis of the issuer's country
credit rating. However, the ratings relationship between national ratings and global ratings is not linear with the U.S. The starting point for national ratings differs by country, which makes the
assessment of credit quality more difficult. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Investments — International Investment Operations." An increase in defaults on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could harm our financial strength and reduce our
profitability.

An increased rate of delinquency and defaults on our commercial mortgage loans, especially those with balloon payments, could decrease our profitability.

Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio faces both delinquency and default risk. Commercial mortgage loans of $10.8 billion represented 17% of our total
invested assets as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, loans that were in the process of foreclosure totaled $13.0 million, or 0.12% of our commercial mortgage loan
portfolio. The performance of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, however, may fluctuate in the future. An increase in the delinquency rate of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio could harm our
financial strength and decrease our profitability.

As
of December 31, 2007, approximately $9.1 billion, or 84%, of our commercial mortgage loans before valuation allowance had balloon payment maturities. A balloon maturity
is a loan with larger dollar amounts of payments becoming due in the later years of the loan. The default rate on commercial mortgage loans with balloon payment maturities has historically been higher
than for commercial mortgage loans with standard repayment schedules. Since most of the principal is being repaid at maturity, the amount of loss on a default is generally greater than on other
commercial mortgage loans. An increase in defaults on such loans as a result of the foregoing factors could harm our financial strength and reduce our net income.

We may have difficulty selling our privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments because they are less liquid than our publicly traded fixed
maturity securities.

As
of December 31, 2007, our privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments represented approximately 42% of the value of our
invested assets. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices, in a timely manner, or both.


Derivative instruments may not be honored by counterparties resulting in ineffective hedging of our risks.

We
use derivative instruments to hedge various risks we face in our businesses. See Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." We enter into a variety
of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, currency swaps, currency forwards, credit default swaps, treasury lock agreements, commodity swaps and options, with a
number of counterparties. If, however, our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, we will have failed to effectively hedge the related risk. That failure may
harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.

Environmental liability exposure may result from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments.

Liability
under environmental protection laws resulting from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments may harm our financial strength and reduce our
profitability. Under the laws of several states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of cleanup. In some states, this kind of lien has
priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property, which would impair our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in default. In addition, under the laws of
some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, we may be liable for costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous
substances that require remedy at a property securing a mortgage loan held by us, if our agents or employees have become sufficiently involved in the hazardous waste aspects of the operations of the
related obligor on that loan, regardless of whether or not the environmental damage or threat was caused by the obligor. We also may face this liability after foreclosing on a property securing a
mortgage loan held by us. This may harm our financial strength and decrease our profitability.

Regional concentration of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio in California may subject us to economic downturns or losses attributable to earthquakes in that state.

Credit
extensions in the state of California accounted for 18%, or $1.9 billion, of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2007. Due to this
concentration of commercial mortgage loans in California, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of an economic downturn in California as well as to catastrophes, such as
earthquakes, that may affect the region. While we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans, we do take into account property specific
engineering reports, construction type and geographical concentration by fault lines in our investment underwriting guidelines. If economic conditions in California deteriorate or catastrophes occur,
we may experience delinquencies on the portion of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio located in California in the future, which may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.

Competition from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance may impair our ability to
retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability.

We
believe that our ability to compete is based on a number of factors including scale, service, product features, price, investment performance, commission structure, distribution
capabilities, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers, many of which
have advantages over us in one or more of the above competitive factors.

Each
of our segments faces strong competition. The primary competitors for our U.S. Asset Accumulation and Global Asset Management segments are asset managers, banks, broker-dealers and
insurers. Our ability to increase and retain AUM is directly related to the performance of our investments as measured against market averages and the performance of our competitors. Even when
securities prices are generally rising, performance can be affected by investment styles. Also, there is a risk that we may not be able to attract and retain the top talent needed to compete in our
industry.

Competition
for our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment comes primarily from local financial services firms and other international companies operating on a
stand-alone basis or in partnership with local firms. Our Life and Health Insurance segment competes with insurers and health maintenance organizations.

National
banks, with their large existing customer bases, may increasingly compete with insurers as a result of court rulings allowing national banks to sell annuity products in some
circumstances, and as a result of legislation removing restrictions on bank affiliations with insurers. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 permits mergers that combine commercial banks,
insurers and securities firms under one holding company. These developments may increase competition, in particular for our asset management and accumulation businesses, by substantially increasing
the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors who may be able to offer, due to economies of scale, more competitive pricing than we can.


A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, reduce new sales and terminate relationships with distributors, impact
existing liabilities and increase our cost of capital, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.

Ratings
are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A rating downgrade, or the potential for such a downgrade, could, among other things:

•

materially
increase the number of policy or contract surrenders for all or a portion of their net cash values and withdrawals by policyholders of cash values from their
policies or with respect to general account guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements purchased by pension plans and other institutions;

•

result
in the termination of our relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers and other distributors of our products and services;

•

reduce
new sales, particularly with respect to general account guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements purchased by pension plans and other institutions;

•

cause
some of our existing liabilities to be subject to acceleration, additional collateral support, changes in terms, or creation of additional financial obligations; and

•

increase
our cost of capital and limit our access to the capital markets.

Any
of these consequences could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.

Unforeseen increases in cash outflows may negatively impact our liquidity.

We maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is believed adequate to meet anticipated
short-term and long-term benefit and expense payment obligations. However, withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, such as
changes in the interest rate environment or changes in our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings. For example, a significant increase in interest rates may cause our policyholders to
withdraw the cash values of their policies in order to seek more attractive returns elsewhere. A downgrade in our financial strength ratings could also cause an increase in policyholder withdrawals.
If policyholder withdrawals significantly exceed our expectations, we may be forced to borrow funds or liquidate investments to raise the funds necessary to fund the withdrawals. Liquidations may
result in capital losses, particularly in periods of volatile interest rates. Because volatile interest rates often make it more difficult to sell certain fixed income securities, there is also a risk
that we will find it difficult to raise the cash necessary to fund a very large amount of withdrawal activity.

Certain
aspects of our businesses help us mitigate potential liquidity risk:

•

Our
liability portfolio is diverse. Many of our products have fairly predictable cash demands, and where cash demands are less predictable, we have the ability to defer or
spread out the cash payments. Importantly, our products have features to discourage surrenders.

•

Our
asset portfolio is also diverse and spread over many different types of exposures (asset class, credit, geography, industry, etc.).

For
further discussion on liquidity risk management, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Our efforts to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our profitability and retained earnings may not be effective.

We
attempt to significantly reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the profitability and retained earnings of our asset accumulation and life and health insurance operations.
We accomplish this reduction primarily by managing the duration of our assets relative to the duration of our liabilities. During a period of rising interest rates, policy surrenders, withdrawals and
requests for policy loans may increase as customers seek to achieve higher returns. Despite our efforts to reduce the impact of rising interest rates, we may be required to sell assets to raise the
cash necessary to respond to such surrenders, withdrawals and loans, thereby realizing capital losses on the assets sold. An increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals may also require us to
accelerate amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DPAC") relating to these contracts, which would further reduce our profitability.

During
periods of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay or redeem mortgages and bonds that we own, which would force us to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates. For
some of our products, such as guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements, we are unable to lower the rate we credit to customers in response to the lower return we will earn on our
investments. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to maintain our desired spread between the investment income we earn and the interest we credit to our customers during periods of declining
interest rates, thereby reducing our profitability.


We
estimate that an immediate interest rate decrease of 100 basis points would reduce our operating earnings by less than 1% over the next year. However, if the lower interest rate level
continues, the net impact could grow over time, as our existing investments mature and the proceeds are reinvested in lower yielding assets. Total cumulative operating earnings over the next
5 years could be reduced by approximately 1% per year if interest rates were to remain at the lower levels.

For
further discussion on interest rate risk management, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk".

If we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives and develop new distribution sources, sales of our products and services may be reduced.

We
distribute our asset accumulation, asset management and life, health and specialty benefit insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels, including our
own internal sales representatives, independent brokers, banks, broker-dealers and other third-party marketing organizations. We must attract and retain sales representatives to sell our products.
Strong competition exists among financial services companies for efficient sales representatives. We compete with other financial services companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of
our financial position, support services and compensation and product features. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient sales representatives to sell our products, our ability to compete and
revenues from new sales would suffer.

Our international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that could reduce our profitability in those businesses.

Our
international businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision from central and/or local governmental authorities in each country in which we operate. New
interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations may harm our international businesses and reduce our profitability in those businesses.

Our
international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in our operations in the U.S. We face the risk of discriminatory regulation,
nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they
operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some of our international businesses are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging or potentially volatile
markets. In addition, we rely on local staff, including local sales forces, in these countries where there is a risk that we may encounter labor problems with local staff, especially in countries
where workers' associations and trade unions are strong. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in that country.

We may face losses if our actual experience differs significantly from our pricing and reserving assumptions.

Our
profitability depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in setting prices for our products and establishing
liabilities for future insurance and annuity policy benefits and claims. The premiums that we charge and the liabilities that we hold for future policy benefits are based on assumptions concerning a
number of factors, including the amount of premiums that we will receive in the future, rate of return on assets we purchase with premiums received, expected claims, mortality, morbidity, expenses and
persistency, which is the measurement of the percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year, as measured by premiums. However, due to the nature of the underlying risks and the
high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liabilities for unpaid policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts we will ultimately pay to settle these
liabilities. As a result, we may experience volatility in the level of our profitability and our reserves from period to period, particularly for our health and disability insurance products. To the
extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than our underlying assumptions, we could be required to increase our liabilities, which may harm our financial strength and reduce our
profitability.

For
example, if mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we will be required to make greater claims payments on our life insurance policies than we had projected.
However, this risk is partially offset by our payout annuity business, where an increase in mortality rates will result in a decrease in benefit payments. We estimate that an immediate and sustained
5% increase in all mortality rates above what we are expecting would reduce total company operating earnings by less than 1% over the next year.

Our
earnings may also be adversely impacted by an increase in morbidity rates. We estimate that an increase of 5 percentage points in our medical loss ratios above what we are
expecting would reduce total company operating earnings by approximately 5-7% over the next year, and an increase of 5 percentage points in our dental, vision and disability loss
ratios above what we are expecting would reduce total company operating earnings by approximately 3-4% over the next year.

For
additional information on our insurance reserves, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Insurance Reserves."


Our ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet our obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal
Life.

We
are an insurance holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Principal Life and other direct subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends
to our stockholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and any debt service, depends upon the receipt of dividends from Principal Life. Iowa insurance laws impose
limitations on the ability of Principal Life to pay dividends to us. Any inability of Principal Life to pay dividends to us in the future may cause us to be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders
and meet our other obligations. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a
discussion of regulatory restrictions on Principal Life's ability to pay us dividends.

The pattern of amortizing our DPAC and other actuarial balances on our investment contract, participating life insurance and universal life-type products may
change, impacting both the level of the asset and the timing of our net income.

Amortization
of the DPAC asset depends on the actual and expected profits generated by the lines of business that incurred the expenses. Expected profits are dependent on assumptions
regarding a number of factors including investment returns, benefit payments, expenses, mortality and policy lapse. Due to the uncertainty associated with establishing these assumptions, we cannot,
with precision, determine the exact pattern of profit emergence. As a result, amortization of DPAC will vary from period to period. To the extent that actual experience emerges less favorably than
expected, or our expectation for future profits decreases, the DPAC asset may be reduced, reducing our profitability in the current period.

For
additional information, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates — Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances."

We may need to fund deficiencies in our Closed Block assets.

In connection with its conversion in 1998 into a stock life insurance company, Principal Life established an accounting mechanism, known as a "Closed Block" for
the benefit of participating ordinary life insurance policies that had a dividend scale in force on July 1, 1998. Dividend scales are the actuarial formulas used by life insurance companies to
determine amounts payable as dividends on participating policies based on experience factors relating to, among other things, investment results, mortality, lapse rates, expenses, premium taxes and
policy loan interest and utilization rates. The Closed Block was designed to provide reasonable assurance to policyholders included in the
Closed Block that, after the conversion, assets would be available to maintain the aggregate dividend scales in effect for 1997 if the experience underlying such scales were to continue.

We
allocated assets to the Closed Block as of July 1, 1998 in an amount such that we expect their cash flows, together with anticipated revenues from the policies in the Closed
Block, to be sufficient to support the Closed Block business, including payment of claims, expenses, charges and taxes and to provide for the continuation of aggregate dividend scales in accordance
with the 1997 policy dividend scales if the experience underlying such scales continues, and to allow for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. We bear the costs of
expenses associated with Closed Block policies and, accordingly, these costs were not funded as part of the assets allocated to the Closed Block. Any increase in such costs in the future will be borne
by us. As of December 31, 2007, Closed Block assets and liabilities were $4,806.5 million and $5,811.0 million, respectively.

We
will continue to pay guaranteed benefits under the policies included in the Closed Block, in accordance with their terms. The Closed Block assets, cash flows generated by the Closed
Block assets and anticipated revenues from polices included in the Closed Block may not be sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies. If they are not sufficient, we must
fund the shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose for business reasons to support dividend payments on policies in the Closed Block with our general account funds.

The
Closed Block assets, cash flows generated by the Closed Block assets and anticipated revenues from policies in the Closed Block will benefit only the holders of those policies. In
addition, to the extent that these amounts are greater than the amounts estimated at the time we funded the Closed Block, dividends payable in respect of the policies included in the Closed Block may
be greater than they would have been in the absence of a Closed Block. Any excess earnings will be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders but will not be available to our
stockholders.

A pandemic, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could adversely affect our net income.

Our
mortality and morbidity experience could be adversely impacted by a catastrophic event. In addition, a severe catastrophic event may cause significant volatility in global financial
markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The resulting macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows, as well as the value and liquidity of our invested assets.
We may also experience operational disruptions if our employees are unable or unwilling


to
come to work due to a pandemic or other catastrophe. We have developed extensive contingency plans to minimize the risk of operational disruptions. In addition, our use of reinsurance reduces our
exposure to adverse mortality experience. Despite these measures, we may still be exposed to losses in the event of a pandemic, terrorist attack, or other catastrophe.

Our reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates, which could adversely impact our net income and profitability.

We
cede material amounts of insurance to other insurance companies through reinsurance. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies." However, we remain liable to the policyholder, even if the reinsurer defaults on its obligations with respect to
the ceded business. If a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations, we will be forced to cover
the claims on the reinsured policies. In addition, a reinsurer insolvency may cause us to lose our reserve credits on the ceded business, in which case we would be required to establish additional
reserves.

The
premium rates that we charge are based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a certain cost. Some of our reinsurance contracts contain provisions which
limit the reinsurer's ability to increase rates on in-force business; however, some do not. If a reinsurer raises the rates that it charges on a block of in-force business, our
profitability may be negatively impacted if we are not able to pass the increased costs on to the customer. If reinsurers raise the rates that they charge on new business, we may be forced to raise
the premiums that we charge, which could have a negative impact on our competitive position.

To
mitigate the risks associated with the use of reinsurance, we carefully select our reinsurers, and we monitor their ratings and financial condition on a regular basis. We also spread
our business among several reinsurers, in order to diversify our risk exposure.

We face risks arising from acquisitions of businesses.

We have engaged in acquisitions of businesses in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future. We face a number of risks arising from acquisition
transactions, including difficulties in integrating the acquired business into our operations, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the
existing customers of the acquired entity, and unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired business. These risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from
acquisitions.

Changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards may reduce our profitability.

Changes in regulations may reduce our profitability.

Our insurance business is subject to comprehensive state regulation and supervision throughout the U.S and in the international markets in which we operate. We
are also impacted by federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulations and federal taxation. The primary purpose of
state regulation of the insurance business is to protect policyholders, not stockholders. The laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers to regulate such matters as:

•

licensing
companies to transact business,

•

licensing
agents,

•

admitting
statutory assets,

•

mandating
a number of insurance benefits,

•

regulating
premium rates,

•

approving
policy forms,

•

regulating
unfair trade and claims practices,

•

establishing
statutory reserve requirements and solvency standards,

•

fixing
maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values,

•

restricting
various transactions between affiliates, and

•

regulating
the types, amounts and valuation of investments.

State
insurance regulators, federal regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, and may impose
changes in the future.


Federal
legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability. For
example, Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to permit application of state law remedies, such as
consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. Additionally, new interpretations of
existing laws
and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously. In addition, reductions in contribution levels to
defined contribution plans may decrease our profitability.

Changes in tax laws could increase our tax costs and reduce sales of our insurance, annuity and investment products.

Current
federal income tax laws generally permit the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by the holders of annuities and life insurance products.
Taxes, if any, are payable on income attributable to a distribution under the contract for the year in which the distribution is made. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation that
would reduce or eliminate the benefit of such deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within life insurance and non-qualified annuity contracts. Enactment of this legislation,
including a simplified "flat tax" income structure with an exemption from taxation for investment income, could result in fewer sales of our insurance, annuity and investment products.

From
time to time, Congress, as well as foreign, state and local governments, considers legislation that could increase our tax costs. If such legislation is adopted, our profitability
could be negatively impacted.

Repeal or modification of the federal estate tax could reduce our revenues.

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (the "Act") amended the federal estate tax laws by increasing the amount of the unified credit
beginning in 2002, thereby increasing the amount of property not subject to the estate tax. The Act also gradually reduces the federal estate tax rate over a period of years beginning in 2002, and
repeals the tax entirely in 2010. The law in effect prior to the Act, however, is reinstated for years after 2010. Through the year ended December 31, 2007, we received recurring premium of
$51.0 million for survivorship life insurance policies we have sold. A significant number of these policies were purchased for the purpose of providing cash to pay federal estate taxes. The
reduction of the federal estate tax and temporary repeal could result in policyholders reducing coverage under, or surrendering, these policies.

Changes in federal, state and foreign securities laws may reduce our profitability.

Our
asset management and accumulation and life insurance businesses are subject to various levels of regulation under federal, state and foreign securities laws. These laws and
regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory or brokerage clients and generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers,
including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. Changes to these laws or regulations that restrict the conduct of our business
could reduce our profitability.

Changes in accounting standards may reduce our profitability.

Accounting standards are subject to change and can negatively impact our profitability. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies." In addition to recently issued accounting guidance, the standard setters have a full agenda
of topics they plan to review, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. The results for past accounting periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for any future accounting period.

A computer system failure or security breach could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.

We
rely on computer systems to conduct business, including customer service, marketing and sales activities, customer relationship management and producing financial statements. While we
have policies, procedures, automation and backup plans designed to prevent or limit the effect of failure, our computer systems may be vulnerable to disruptions or breaches as the result of natural
disasters, man-made disasters, criminal activity, pandemics, or other events beyond our control. The failure of our computer systems for any reason could disrupt our operations, result in
the loss of customer business and adversely impact our profitability.

We
retain confidential information on our computer systems, including customer information and proprietary business information. Any compromise of the security of our computer systems
that results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation, increase regulatory scrutiny and require us to incur significant
technical, legal and other expenses.


Results of litigation and regulatory investigations may affect our financial strength or reduce our profitability.

We
are a plaintiff or defendant in actions arising out of our insurance businesses and investment operations. We are, from time to time, also involved in various governmental, regulatory
and administrative proceedings and inquiries. These factors may affect our financial strength or reduce our profitability. For further discussion on litigation and regulatory investigation risk, see
Item 3. "Legal Proceedings."

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our profitability.

Principal International generally writes policies denominated in various local currencies and invests the premiums and deposits in local currencies. Although
investing in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of these results into our
consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on foreign currency exchange risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk —
Foreign Currency Risk."

Applicable laws and our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders
might consider in their best interests.

State
laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent, or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in
their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts
in the future.

State
laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate
management entrenchment, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.

The
following provisions, included in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover
attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:

•

permit
our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;

•

divide
our Board of Directors into three classes;

•

limit
the ability of stockholders to remove directors;

•

prohibit
stockholders from filling vacancies on our Board of Directors;

•

prohibit
stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;

•

impose
advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings; and

•

require
the approval by the holders of at least 75% of our outstanding common stock for the amendment of our by-laws and provisions of our certificate of
incorporation governing:

•

the
classified board,

•

the
director's discretion in determining what he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of Principal Financial Group, Inc.,

•

the
liability of directors and

•

the
elimination of the prohibition on stockholder actions by written consent.

In
addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an "interested stockholder" to engage in business combinations with us.
An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.

Our
stockholder rights plan may have anti-takeover effects. The stockholder rights plan is designed to protect our stockholders in the event of unsolicited offers to acquire
us and other coercive takeover tactics, which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, could impair the board's ability to represent stockholder interests. Our stockholder rights plan might render
an unsolicited takeover more difficult or less likely to occur, even though such a takeover might offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market
price and may be favored by our stockholders.


Our financial results may be adversely impacted by global climate changes.

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution, resulting in a gradual
increase in global average temperatures and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. These trends are expected to continue in the future, and have the potential to impact nearly
all sectors of the economy to varying degrees. Our initial research indicates that climate change does not pose an imminent or significant threat to our operations or business, but we will continue to
monitor new developments in the future.

Potential
impacts may include the following:

•

Changes
in temperatures and air quality may adversely impact our mortality and morbidity rates. For example, increases in the level of pollution and airborne allergens may
cause an increase in upper respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, leading to increased claims in our life, health and disability income business. However, the risk of increased mortality on our life
insurance business is partly offset by our payout annuity business, where an increase in mortality results in a decrease in benefit payments.

•

Climate
change may impact asset prices, as well as general economic conditions. For example, rising sea levels may lead to decreases in real estate values in coastal areas.
Additionally, government policies to slow climate change (e.g., setting limits on carbon emissions) may have an adverse impact on sectors such as utilities, transportation and manufacturing.
Changes in asset prices may impact the value of our fixed income, real estate and commercial mortgage investments. We manage our investment risks by maintaining a well-diversified
portfolio, both geographically and by sector. We also monitor our investments on an on-going basis, allowing us to adjust our exposure to sectors and/or geographical areas that face severe
risks due to climate change.

A
natural disaster that affects one of our office locations could disrupt our operations and pose a threat to the safety of our employees. However, we have extensive
Disaster Recovery programs in place to help mitigate this risk.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

We own 26 properties in our home office complex in Des Moines, Iowa, and in various other locations. Of these 26 properties, 11 are office buildings, 2 are
warehouse facilities, 11 are parking lots and ramps, 1 is a park/green space and 1 is a childcare center that is currently under construction. Of the office and warehouse space, we occupy
approximately 90% of the 2.8 million square feet of space in these buildings. The balance of the space in these buildings is rented to commercial tenants or is occupied by the property
management company servicing these properties. Of the parking properties there are approximately 5,119 stalls, which does not include additional stalls that will be created once construction of a new
parking ramp is completed. We lease office space for various offices located throughout the U.S. and internationally. We believe that our owned and leased properties are suitable and adequate for our
current business operations.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following analysis discusses our financial condition as of December 31, 2007, compared with December 31, 2006, and our consolidated results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance. The discussion should be read in conjunction
with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Forward-Looking Information

Our narrative analysis below contains forward-looking statements intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our future financial performance.
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that represent our beliefs concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments, and contain words
and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current expectations and
beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

Actual
results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not
limited to the risk factors listed in Item 1A. "Risk Factors."

Overview

We provide financial products and services through the following reportable segments:

•

U.S.
Asset Accumulation, which consists of our asset accumulation operations that provide retirement savings and related investment products and services. We provide a
comprehensive portfolio of asset accumulation products and services to businesses and individuals in the U.S., with a concentration on small and medium-sized businesses. We offer to businesses
products and services for defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans, non-qualified executive benefit plans and employee stock
ownership plan consulting services. We also offer annuities, mutual funds and bank products and services to the employees of our business customers and other individuals.

•

Global
Asset Management, which consists of our asset management operations conducted through Principal Global Investors and its affiliates. Global Asset Management offers an
extensive range of equity, fixed income and real estate investments as well as specialized overlay and advisory services to institutional investors.

•

International
Asset Management and Accumulation, which consists of Principal International, offers retirement products and services, annuities, mutual funds, institutional
asset management and life insurance accumulation products through operations in Brazil, Chile, China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, and Mexico.

•

Life
and Health Insurance, which provides individual life insurance, group health insurance as well as specialty benefits in the U.S. Our individual life insurance products
include universal and variable universal life insurance and traditional life insurance. Our health insurance products include group medical insurance and fee-for-service claims
administration and wellness services. Our specialty benefit products include group dental and vision insurance, individual and group disability insurance and group life insurance.

•

Corporate
and Other, which manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate and Other segment
primarily reflect our financing activities (including interest expense), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses
and other after-tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items.

Economic Factors and Trends

Modest results in the equity markets along with an increase in net cash flow have led to increases in asset accumulation's account values and our asset
management's AUM. The credit market disruptions and market illiquidity experienced during the second half of 2007 resulted in an increase in our realized and unrealized capital losses.

In
our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment, we continued to grow our existing business through organic growth in our existing subsidiaries and a combination of joint
ventures and strategic acquisitions.

Over
the past few years, we have shifted our marketing emphasis to universal and variable universal life insurance products from traditional life insurance products in our Life and
Health segment. We are also in the early stages of a trend toward voluntary individual life insurance and specialty benefit products sponsored by employers. Our health insurance business has become
less competitive, which has led to declines in covered members.


Profitability

Our profitability depends in large part upon our:

•

amount
of AUM;

•

spreads
we earn on our policyholders' general account asset accumulation business that result from the difference between what we earn and what we credit;

•

ability
to generate fee revenues by providing administrative and investment management services;

•

ability
to price our life and health insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the related expenses;

•

ability
to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or impairments of invested assets;

•

ability
to effectively hedge fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates on certain transactions; and

•

ability
to manage our operating expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our accounting policies. Our
significant accounting policies are described in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and
Significant Accounting Policies." We have identified five critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. A
summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in
estimates and changes in guidance. The identification, selection and disclosure of critical accounting estimates and policies have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Valuation of Invested Assets

Fixed Maturities, Available-for-Sale.

Fixed maturity securities include
bonds, mortgage-backed securities and redeemable preferred stock. We classify our fixed maturity securities as either available-for-sale or trading and, accordingly, carry them
at fair value in the statement of financial position. The fair values of our public fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices or
estimates from independent pricing services. However, 24% of our invested asset portfolio is invested in fixed maturity securities that are private market assets, where there are no readily available
market quotes to determine the fair market value. These assets are valued using a spread pricing matrix. Securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by asset class, sector, rating and
average life. Each pricing category is assigned a risk spread based on studies of observable public market data or market clearing data from the investment professionals assigned to specific security
classes. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted back at the current Treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread. Although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair
valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an individual security within each pricing category may actually be impacted by company specific factors. Certain market events that could impact
the valuation of securities include issuer credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions among others.

Over
the past several months, we have seen credit market disruption as the result of widening spreads and illiquid markets. These market conditions have been particularly hard on
structured investment transactions where we rely on broker quotes or internal pricing models given the thinly traded markets (approximately 5% of the fixed maturity securities portfolio). We have
received broker quotes that are outside a normal range for historical spreads and, in our view, are conservative given the quality of the underlying cash flows. Analysis has been performed to
reconcile these external values to our view of the transaction. We view these broker quotes as conservative and at the low end of a reasonable range, and attribute the decreased values to the overall
market conditions.

An
interest rate increase in the range of 20 to 100 basis points, while holding credit spreads constant, produces total values of $40.2 billion to $38.6 billion, as
compared to the recorded amount of $40.5 billion related to our fixed maturity, available-for-sale assets held by the Principal Life general account as of
December 31, 2007. This portfolio has a weighted average life of 7 years. An analysis of historical changes in the 7-year Treasury rate supports our belief that an interest
rate change of 20 to 100 basis points is reasonably likely.

Investments
classified as available-for-sale are subject to impairment reviews. When evaluating a fixed maturity security for impairment, we consider relevant
facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest-related impairment is other than temporary. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of
time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact
of any specific events; and (4) our ability and intent to hold


the
security for a period of time that allows for the recovery of value which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. When it is determined that the decline in value is other than temporary the
carrying value of the security is reduced to its fair value, with a corresponding charge to net income. The corresponding charge is referred to as an other-than-temporary
impairment and is reported in net income in our consolidated statement of operations.

There
are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks and
uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that
issuer; (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; (3) the risk that our investment professionals are
making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers; and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and
circumstances lead us to change our intent to hold the security until it recovers in value. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period. At December 31,
2007, we had $19,990.4 million in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with gross unrealized losses totaling $1,187.6 million. Included in the gross
unrealized losses are losses attributable to both movements in market interest rates as well as temporary credit issues. Net income would be reduced by approximately $1,187.6 million, on a
pre-tax basis, if all the securities were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.

Mortgage Loans.

Mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. At
December 31, 2007, commercial mortgage loans aggregated to $10,763.5 million. Commercial mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual
of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, and
reported as mortgage loans in the statements of financial position.

Commercial
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we determine that a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the
estimated value. Estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or fair
value of the collateral. The change in valuation allowance is reported in net income on our consolidated statements of operations.

The
determination of the calculation and the adequacy of the mortgage loan allowance and mortgage impairments are subjective. Our periodic evaluation and assessment of the adequacy of
the allowance for losses and the need for mortgage impairments is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated
value of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, loss experience and other relevant factors. The calculation for determining loan specific impairment
amounts is also subjective, as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Our financial position is sensitive to changes in estimated
cash flows from mortgages, the value of the collateral and changes in the economic environment in general. The allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and
decrease when economic conditions improve.

We
have a large experienced commercial real estate staff centrally located in Des Moines, which includes commercial mortgage underwriters, loan closers, loan servicers, engineers,
appraisers, credit analysts, research staff, legal staff, information technology personnel and portfolio managers. Experienced commercial real estate senior management adheres to a disciplined process
in reviewing all transactions for approval on a consistent basis. The typical commercial mortgage loan for us averages in the mid-60 percent loan-to-value
range at origination with a net operating income coverage ratio of 1.7 times the annual debt service and is internally rated A- on a bond equivalent basis. Based on the most recent
analysis, our commercial mortgage portfolio has an overall loan-to-value ratio of 59% with a 1.9 times debt service coverage. The large equity cushion and strong debt service
coverage in our commercial mortgage investments will help insulate us from stress during times of weak commercial real estate fundamentals.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances

Commissions and other costs (underwriting, issuance and agency expenses) that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance
policies and investment contract business are capitalized to the extent recoverable. Maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to operations as incurred.

Amortization Based on Estimated Gross Profits.

DPAC for universal life-type insurance
contracts, participating life insurance policies and certain investment contracts are amortized over the expected lifetime of the policies in relation to estimated gross profits. In addition to DPAC,
the following actuarial balances are also amortized in relation to estimated gross profits or contract assessments.


•

Sales
inducement asset — Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the contractholder's account balance as an inducement to increase sales. Like
DPAC, the cost of the sales inducement is capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract, in proportion to estimated gross profits.

•

Unearned
revenue liability — An unearned revenue liability is established when we collect fees or other policyholder assessments that represent
compensation for services to be provided in future periods. These revenues are deferred and then amortized over the expected life of the contract, in proportion to estimated gross profits.

•

Reinsurance
asset or liability — For universal-life type products that are reinsured, a reinsurance asset or liability is established to
spread the net reinsurance costs or profits in proportion to the estimated gross profits on the underlying business.

•

Present
value of future profits ("PVFP") — This is an intangible asset that arises in connection with the acquisition of a life insurance company. PVFP is
amortized over the expected life of the contracts acquired, in proportion to estimated gross profits.

•

Additional
benefit reserves — These are additional liabilities that are established for annuity or universal life-type contracts that provide
benefit guarantees, or for contracts that are expected to produce profits followed by losses. The liabilities are accrued in relation to estimated contract assessments.

At
issue and each valuation date, we develop an estimate of the expected future gross profits. These estimated gross profits contain assumptions relating to mortality, morbidity,
investment yield and expenses. As actual experience emerges, the gross profits may vary from those expected either in magnitude or timing in which case a true-up to actual occurs as a
charge or credit to current operations. In addition, we are required to revise our assumptions regarding future experience as soon as the current assumptions are no longer actuarially credible. Both
actions, reflecting actual experience and changing future estimates, can change both the current amount and the future amortization pattern of the DPAC asset and related actuarial balances.

For
individual variable annuities and group annuities which have separate account equity investment options, we utilize a mean reversion method (reversion to the mean assumption), a
common industry practice, to determine the future domestic equity market growth rate assumption used for the calculation of estimated gross profits. If actual equity market performance varies from the
8% assumption, we assume different performance levels over the next 30 quarters such that the mean return equals the long-term assumption. However, our mean reversion process generally
limits assumed returns to 4-12% during the 30-quarter mean reversion period.

Internal Replacements.

We review polices for modifications that result in the exchange of an existing
contract for a new contract. If the new contract is determined to be an internal replacement that is substantially changed from the replaced contract, any unamortized DPAC and actuarial balances are
written off and acquisition costs related to the new contract are capitalized as appropriate. If the new contract is substantially unchanged, we continue to amortize the related DPAC and actuarial
balances.

Recoverability.

DPAC and sales inducement assets are subject to recoverability testing at the time of
policy issue and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event occurs that may warrant loss recognition. Likewise, PVFP is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or when an
event occurs that may warrant impairment. If loss recognition or impairment is necessary, the asset balances are written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and
investment income or gross profits are not adequate to cover related losses and expenses.


Sensitivities.

As of December 31, 2007, the net balance of DPAC and related actuarial balances
was a $3,014.7 million asset. We perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact that certain assumptions have on our DPAC and related actuarial balances. The following table shows the
estimated immediate impact of various assumption changes on our DPAC and related actuarial balances.

This
calculation reflects an increase in lapse rates only for products where increasing the lapse rate leads to a write-down of the DPAC asset. Lapse rates were left
unchanged for those products where an increase in lapse rates would lead to a write-up of the DPAC asset.

Amortization Based on Premium-paying Period.

DPAC of non-participating term life and
individual disability insurance policies are amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policyholder liabilities. Once
these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies, they will not be changed over the life of the policy unless a loss recognition event occurs.

Insurance Reserves

Reserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due, at some point in the future, to or on behalf of our policyholders.
U.S. GAAP, allowing for some degree of managerial judgment, prescribes the methods of establishing reserves.

Future
policy benefits and claims include reserves for traditional and group life insurance, accident and health insurance and individual and group annuities that provide periodic income
payments, which are computed using assumptions of mortality, morbidity, lapse, investment performance and expense. These assumptions are based on our experience and are periodically reviewed against
industry standards to ensure actuarial credibility. For long duration insurance contracts, once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies, they will not be changed over the
life of the policy. However, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. Premium
deficiency reserves may also be established for short duration contracts to provide for expected future losses. Our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis including,
among other things, experience studies, claim development analysis and annual statutory asset adequacy analysis. To the extent experience indicates potential loss recognition, we recognize losses on
certain lines of business. The ultimate accuracy of the assumptions on these long-tailed insurance products cannot be determined until the obligation of the entire block of business on
which the assumptions were made is extinguished. Short-term variances of actual results from the assumptions used in the computation of the reserves are reflected in current period net
income and can impact quarter-to-quarter net income.

Future
policy benefits and claims also include reserves for incurred but unreported health, disability and life insurance claims. We recognize claims costs in the period the service was
provided to our policyowners. However, claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive, process and pay the claims. We determine the amount of this
liability using actuarial methods based on historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends, where applicable, to determine our estimate of claim liabilities. We also look
back to assess how our prior periods' estimates developed. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claim expense. Historically, the amount of
the claim reserve adjustment made in subsequent reporting periods for prior period estimates was within a reasonable range given our normal claim fluctuations.

Benefit Plans

The reported expense and liability associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans requires the use of assumptions. Numerous assumptions are made
regarding the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, turnover, expected compensation increases, health care claim costs, health care cost trends, retirement rates
and mortality. The discount rate and the expected return on plan assets have the most significant impact on the level of cost.

The
assumed discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments inherent in the Projected Benefit Obligation and discounting those cash flows using a spot yield curve known
as the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. This curve is constructed from the Treasury curve by adding option-adjusted spreads that are drawn from the double-A


corporate
sector of the Salomon Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index. The bonds with excessive call exposure are excluded, as are securities with option-adjusted spreads that are more than two standard
deviations away from the preliminary average. The final spreads are determined using this call-protected sample of double-A corporate bonds. Based on this methodology for
2007 year-end, we set the discount rate at 6.30%. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase pension benefits Projected Benefit Obligation and the 2008 Net Periodic
Pension Cost ("NPPC") by approximately $61.4 million and $9.3 million, respectively. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase other post-retirement benefits
Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation and the 2008 Net Periodic Benefit Cost ("NPBC") by approximately $8.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the
discount rate would result in decreases in benefit obligations and expenses at a level generally commensurate with those noted above.

The
assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is set at the long-term rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the
plans and the various classes of the invested funds. Historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk-free real rate of return and risk
premiums for each asset class. The overall long-term rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component, the risk free real rate of return and
the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on long-term returns for each asset class, the plan's target asset allocation policy and the tax structure of the
trusts. For the 2007 NPPC and 2007 NPBC, an 8.25% and 7.3% weighted average long-term rate of return was used, respectively. For the 2008 NPPC and 2008 NPBC, an 8.25% and 7.3% weighted
average long-term rate of return assumption will be used, respectively. A 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return would increase 2008 NPPC by approximately
$3.9 million and the 2008 NPBC by approximately $1.3 million. A 0.25% increase in this rate would result in a decrease to expense at the same levels. The assumed return on plan assets is
based on the fair market value of plan assets as of September 30, 2007.

The
compensation increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation.

Actuarial
gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of employees, which is approximately
8 years for pension costs and approximately 13 years for other postretirement benefit costs.

Prior
service costs are amortized on a weighted average basis over approximately 7 years for both pension and other postretirement benefit costs.

Income Taxes

We provide for income taxes based on our estimate of the liability for taxes due. Our tax accounting represents management's best estimate of various events and
transactions, such as completion of tax audits, which could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate in a particular quarter or annual period.

Inherent
in the provision for income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items, the timing of income and expense recognition and the realization of certain tax
credits. In the event our estimates of the ultimate deductibility of certain items, the timing of the recognition of income and expense or the realization of certain tax credits differ from prior
estimates due to the receipt of new information, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Any such change could
significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these estimates change.

In
addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits in various jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized for book purposes when the
more-likely-than-not threshold is met with regard to the validity of the tax position. Once this threshold is met, for each tax reporting issue, we provide for the
largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the IRS and other income taxing authorities for audits ongoing or not yet commenced. We
believe that we have adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution of contested issues could take several years while legal remedies are pursued.
Consequently, we do not anticipate the ultimate resolution of audits ongoing or not yet commenced to have a material impact on our net income.

Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations

Acquisitions

We acquired the following businesses, among others, during the past three years:

Morley Financial Services, Inc.

On August 31, 2007, we acquired Morley Financial

estate investment arm of Principal Global Investors. U.S. Bank National Association is the principal banking subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp. The new company is the CMBS platform for both Principal Real
Estate Investors and U.S. Bank National Association and focuses on securitizing commercial mortgages originated by both Principal Real Estate Investors and U.S. Bank National Association on their
behalf. Principal Commercial Funding II began operations in late 2005 and began contributing collateral to securitizations during the first quarter of 2006. The operations of Principal Commercial
Funding II are reported in our Global Asset Management segment using the equity method of accounting.

CCB-Principal Asset Management Company, Ltd.

On September 19, 2005, we
entered into a joint venture with China Construction Bank ("CCB") to market mutual funds in the People's Republic of China, with a 25% ownership in CCB-Principal Asset Management
Company, Ltd. The operations of CCB-Principal Asset Management Company, Ltd. are reported in our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment using the equity

filing to the Japanese corporate registry. The results of ING/Principal Pensions Company Ltd. were reported in our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment.

Discontinued Operations.

For divestitures that qualify for discontinued operations treatment, see
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Discontinued Operations."

Other

SBB Mutual Berhad and SBB Asset Management Sdn Bhd.

On February 5, 2007, we invested an
additional RM$192.4 million Malaysian ringgits ("RM$") (approximately U.S. $55.1 million) to retain our 40% ownership interest in CIMB-Principal, our joint venture company in
Malaysia, as a result of its decision to purchase the mutual fund and asset management companies of the former Southern Bank Bhd ("SBB") Mutual Berhad and SBB Asset Management Sdn Bhd.

Senior Note Issuance.

During fourth quarter 2006, we issued $600.0 million of senior notes
from our shelf registration, which became effective on June 30, 2004. The notes bear interest at a rate of 6.05% per year. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on
April 15 and October 15, and began on April 15, 2007. The notes will mature on October 15, 2036. A portion of the proceeds was used to fund the acquisition of WM
Advisors, Inc., with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.

Principal Reinsurance Company of Vermont.

In November 2006, Principal Life established a wholly owned
reinsurance subsidiary, Principal Reinsurance Company of Vermont ("PVT"), which reinsures a portion of our universal life


"secondary"
or "no-lapse" guarantee provisions through an intercompany reinsurance agreement with Principal Life. Effective June 30, 2007, we amended our reinsurance agreement with
PVT to include in force and future policy issuances of a current term insurance product. The reinsurance agreement, which was accompanied with a third party letter of credit issued to PVT and
guaranteed by PFG, allowed us to redeploy capital for other general corporate purposes.

Fluctuations in Foreign Currency to U.S. Dollar Exchange Rates

Fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for countries in which we have operations can affect reported financial results. In years when
foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in fewer U.S. dollars to be reported. When foreign currencies strengthen, translating
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in more U.S. dollars to be reported.

Foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations create variances in our financial statement line items but have not had a material impact on our consolidated income from continuing
operations. Our consolidated income from continuing operations was positively impacted $5.9 million, $5.4 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively, as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for our foreign operations. For a discussion of our approaches to foreign currency exchange
rate risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk."

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

For information related to our Stock-Based Compensation Plans, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 20, Stock-Based Compensation Plans."

Defined Benefit Pension and 401(k) Expense

Effective January 1, 2006, we made changes to our retirement program, including the Principal Select Savings Plan ("401(k)") and the Principal Pension Plan
("Pension Plan") and the corresponding nonqualified plans. The qualified and nonqualified Pension Plans' changes include a reduction to the traditional and cash balance formulas, a change in the early
retirement factors and the removal of the cost of living adjustments for traditional benefits earned after January 1, 2006. The qualified and nonqualified 401(k) Plans' company match increased
from 50% of a contribution rate up to a maximum 3% of the participant's compensation to 75% of a contribution rate up to a maximum of 6% of the participant's compensation. Employees who were
47 years old, with a minimum of ten years of service as of December 31, 2005, were given the choice to remain under the current pension and 401(k) arrangement or move to the new plan
design. The Pension Plan changes reduced the Pension Plan expense in 2006, while the 401(k) changes increased the 401(k) expense.

The
2007 annual pension benefit expense for substantially all of our employees and certain agents was $24.0 million pre-tax, which was a $10.6 million decrease
from the 2006 pre-tax pension expense of $34.6 million. This decrease is primarily due to the increase in discount rate. The discount rate used to develop the 2007 expense was
raised to 6.15%, up from the 5.75% discount rate used to develop the 2006 expense. The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption remained at 8.25%.

The
2008 annual pension benefit expense for substantially all of our employees and certain agents is expected to be $12.3 million pre-tax, which is an
$11.7 million decrease from the 2007 pre-tax pension expense of $24.0 million. This decrease is due to the increase in discount rate and greater than estimated returns on
plan assets. The discount rate used to develop the 2008 expense was raised to 6.3%, up from the 6.15% discount rate used to develop the 2007 expense. The long-term asset assumption
remained at 8.25%.

Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2007, includes $184.6 million of after-tax realized capital
losses related to impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities compared to after-tax realized capital losses of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Excluding the impacts of impairments and increased realized/unrealized capital losses associated with derivative activity, net income available to common stockholders increased $28.7 million,
as increased earnings in the U.S. Asset Accumulation, International Asset Management and Accumulation and Global Asset Management segments were partially offset by decreases within the Life and Health
and Corporate and Other segments. See segment discussion for more details.

Total Revenues

Premiums increased $248.5 million for the U.S. Asset Accumulation segment primarily due to an increase in single premium group annuity sales within our
full service payout business and an increase in our individual payout annuities business primarily relating to increased sales from certain distribution channels. In addition, Life and Health
Insurance segment premiums increased $72.9 million primarily due to growth in our specialty benefits business.

Fees
increased $590.7 million for our U.S. Asset Accumulation segment due to higher management and distribution fees for Principal Funds stemming from an increase in average
account values resulting from our December 31, 2006, acquisition of WM Advisors, Inc. In addition, fees from our full service accumulation business increased due to a comprehensive
assumption study that was completed during the third quarter 2007 which resulted in the unlocking of our unearned revenue and DPAC assumptions and led to the recognition of previously deferred
revenue.

Net
investment income increased due to a $3,376.8 million increase in average invested assets and cash and an increase in the annualized investment yield. The yield on average
invested assets and cash was 6.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Net
realized/unrealized capital gains (losses) can be volatile due to mark to market adjustments of certain invested assets, our decision to sell appreciated invested assets and other
than temporary impairments of invested assets. Net realized/unrealized capital losses increased primarily due to higher impairments, net of recoveries, on fixed maturity securities as well as higher
mark to market losses on derivative activities. For additional information, see "Investments — Investment Results."


Total Expenses

Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $416.4 million for the U.S. Asset Accumulation segment, primarily due to an increase in reserves related
to higher sales of individual payout annuities and higher cost of interest credited related to a growing block in our individual annuities business. In addition, in full service payout, benefit
reserves and expense increased primarily due to strong single premium group annuity sales. Benefits, claims and settlement expenses also increased $201.1 million for the Life and Health
Insurance segment, primarily due to growth in our specialty benefits business and due to higher medical costs and unfavorable prior year claim development in our health insurance business.

U.S.
Asset Accumulation operating expenses increased $461.4 million, primarily due to an increase within Principal Funds relating to higher costs associated with an increase in
staff and infrastructure needed to support the growth in the business and the impact from the WM Advisors, Inc. acquisition. In addition, a $108.6 million increase from the Global Asset
Management segment, primarily in our fee mandate business, was due to continued growth in staff and staff related costs as a result of continued growth in AUM and the acquisitions of Edge Asset
Management and Morley Financial Services.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 20% and 22% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year
ended December 31, 2007 was lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received and interest exclusion from
taxable income. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to income tax deductions allowed for
corporate dividends received, interest exclusion from taxable income and tax refinements in Mexico and Chile.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders for our U.S. Asset Accumulation segment increased $69.3 million as solid investment performance and strong net
cash flows drove a similar increase in account values within our full service accumulation, individual annuities and Principal Funds businesses. In addition, net income available to common
stockholders for our Global Asset Management segment increased $27.1 million as solid investment performance and strong net cash flows increased AUM within our fee mandate business. The
Corporate and Other segment's net income available to common stockholders increased $18.6 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of stock of an equity method investment, gains on sales of
invested assets largely due to real estate properties and a prior year other than temporary impairment of an equity partnership interest. These increases are offset in part by a change in income tax
reserves and associated interest established for IRS tax matters and higher preferred stock dividends as a result of issuing preferred stock in June 2005.

Total Revenues

Premiums increased $331.6 million for the Life and Health segment primarily due to growth in our health insurance and specialty benefits businesses.

Fees
increased $155.7 million for our U.S. Asset Accumulation segment due to higher account values for our full service accumulation and Principal Funds businesses.

Net
investment income increased due to a $2,333.2 million increase in average invested assets and cash and an increase in the annualized investment yield. The yield on average
invested assets and cash was 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Net
realized/unrealized capital gains (losses) can be volatile due to mark to market adjustments of certain invested assets, our decision to sell appreciated invested assets and other
than temporary impairments of invested assets. Net realized/unrealized capital gains increased primarily due to a $44.3 million gain due to the sale of stock of an equity method investment in
2006. For additional information, see "Investments — Investment Results."

Total Expenses

Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $290.1 million for the Life and Health Insurance segment, primarily due to growth in the our health
insurance and specialty benefits businesses. In addition, benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $130.9 million for the U.S. Asset Accumulation segment, primarily due to an increase
in reserves related to higher sales of individual payout annuities and higher cost of interest credited related to a growing block in our individual annuities and investment only businesses.


U.S.
Asset Accumulation operating expenses increased $103.7 million, primarily due to growth in our full service accumulation and individual annuities businesses. The increase in
operating expenses was also due to a $39.7 million increase from the Life and Health Insurance segment primarily resulting from growth in our health insurance and specialty benefits businesses
partially offset by lower DPAC amortization from the individual life business. In addition, the increase reflected a $33.4 million increase from the Global Asset Management segment, primarily
due to continued growth in AUM and an expansion of our U.S. institutional sales function within our fee mandate business and the transition to our joint venture with U.S. Bank.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 22% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year
ended December 31, 2006 was lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received, interest exclusion from taxable
income and tax refinements in Mexico and Chile. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to
income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received, tax credits on our investment in a synthetic fuel production facility and interest exclusion from taxable income.

U.S. Asset Accumulation Segment

U.S. Asset Accumulation Segment Summary Financial Data

Account values are a key indicator of earnings growth for the segment, as account values are the asset base by which the segment generates its fee and
spread-based profits. Net cash flow and market performance are the two main drivers of account value growth. Net cash flow reflects the segment's ability to attract and retain client deposits. Market
performance reflects not only the equity market performance, but also the investment performance of fixed income investments supporting our spread business. The percentage growth in earnings of the
segment should generally track the percentage growth in account values. This trend may vary due to changes in business and/or product mix.

Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006

Operating Earnings

Full service accumulation operating earnings increased $68.1 million primarily due to an increase in account values stemming from solid investment
performance and strong net cash flows. In addition, the 2007 results benefited from the third quarter 2007 completion of a comprehensive assumption study, which resulted in the unlocking of our
unearned revenue and DPAC assumptions and led to the recognition of an operating earnings benefit of $30.1 million after-tax. Principal Funds operating earnings increased
$23.4 million primarily due to higher net commission income and management fees stemming from an increase in sales and an increase in average account values.

Operating Revenues

Premiums in our full service payout business increased $140.0 million primarily due to an increase in single premium group annuity sales. The single
premium group annuity product, which is typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations, can generate large premiums from very few customers and therefore tends to vary from period to period.
Premiums in our individual payout annuities business increased $108.5 million primarily due to increased sales from certain distribution channels.

Fees
in our Principal Funds business increased $346.0 primarily due to higher management and distribution fees stemming from an increase in average account values resulting from our
December 31, 2006, acquisition of WM Advisors, Inc. Fees in our full service accumulation business increased $208.6 million primarily due to a comprehensive assumption study that
was completed during the third quarter 2007, which resulted in the unlocking of our unearned revenue and DPAC assumptions and led to the recognition of previously deferred revenue. Higher fees
generated from the increase in account values also contributed to the increase.

Net
investment income increased primarily due to a $3,097.4 million increase in average invested assets and cash. Average annualized yield on invested assets and cash, was 5.8%
for both the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Total Expenses

Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $195.9 million within our individual annuities business primarily due to an increase in reserves related
to higher sales of individual payout annuities. Also, as a result of a growing block of individual annuities, cost of interest credited on fixed deferred annuities increased. In addition, in full
service payout, benefit reserves and expense increased $141.9 million, primarily due to strong single premium group annuity sales. Furthermore, our investment only business increased
$81.9 million primarily due to an increase in cost of interest credited on this block of business resulting from an increase in account values and higher crediting rates.

Operating
expenses increased $305.5 million within Principal Funds primarily due to higher costs associated with an increase in staff and infrastructure needed to support the
growth in the business and the impact from the WM Advisors, Inc. acquisition. Operating expenses in our full service accumulation business increased $120.9 million primarily due to a
comprehensive assumption study that was completed during the third quarter, which resulted in the unlocking of our unearned revenue and DPAC assumptions and led to the recognition of previously
deferred expenses. Also


contributing
to the increase was growth in the business, which drove increases in staff related costs and management fees paid.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for the segment were 21% and 20% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective income tax
rates were lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received and interest exclusion from taxable income.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Operating Earnings

Full service accumulation and individual annuities operating earnings increased $43.9 million and $12.7 million, respectively, as solid investment
performance and strong net cash flows drove a similar increase in account values for each of these businesses. In addition, earnings within Principal Funds increased $9.1 million primarily due
to growth in account values. Also contributing to the increase was higher net commission income stemming from an increase in sales within Principal Funds.

Operating Revenues

Premiums in our individual payout annuities business increased $44.9 million primarily due to increased sales from certain distribution channels. Partially
offsetting this increase was a $37.8 million decrease in premium from reduced single premium group annuity sales within our full service payout business.

Fees
in our full service accumulation and Principal Funds businesses increased $98.9 million and $29.7 million, respectively, due to higher account values.

Net
investment income increased primarily due to an increase in the average annualized yield on invested assets and cash, which was 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005. In addition, a $1,962.4 million increase in average invested assets and cash contributed to the increase in net investment income.

Total Expenses

Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $82.6 million within our individual annuities business primarily due to an increase in reserves related
to higher sales of individual payout annuities. In addition, as a result of a growing block of individual annuities, cost of interest credited on fixed deferred annuities increased. Furthermore, the
investment only business increased $68.9 million as a result of higher cost of interest credited associated with the growing block of business and increased crediting rates. These increases
were partially offset by a $35.2 million decrease in the full service payout business primarily resulting from a decline in sales of the single premium group annuity product.

Operating
expenses increased $66.1 million in our full service accumulation business primarily due to growth in the business, which drove increases in staff related costs,
management fees paid and amortization of DPAC. In addition, operating expenses in our individual annuities business increased $15.4 million primarily due to strong growth in this block of
business. Furthermore, operating expenses in our Principal Funds business increased $14.4 million primarily due to an increase in management and distribution fees stemming from an increase in
average account values.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for the segment were 20% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective income tax
rates were lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received and interest exclusion from taxable income.

Global Asset Management Segment

Global Asset Management Trends

Asset management services have been among the most profitable and rapidly growing sectors of the financial services industry, at both the retail and institutional
level. Current trends indicate that both retail and institutional investors embrace specialization. We seek to take advantage of these trends by providing expertise in specialty and niche areas, which
command premium fees. We have experienced very good success in winning institutional asset management mandates and expect to see continued growth in this area. Our third-party AUM increased
$28.2 billion during 2007.

Global Asset Management Segment Summary Financial Data

AUM is a key indicator of earnings growth for our Global Asset Management segment, as AUM is the base by which we generate fee mandate and spread and
securitization revenues. Net cash flow and market performance are the two main drivers of AUM growth. Net cash flow reflects our ability to attract and retain client deposits. Market performance
reflects equity, fixed income and real estate market performance. The percentage growth in earnings of the segment will generally track with the percentage growth in AUM. This trend may vary due to
changes in business and/or product mix.

International Asset Management and Accumulation Segment

International Asset Management and Accumulation Trends

Our international asset management and accumulation businesses focus on countries with favorable demographics and growing long-term savings and
defined contribution markets. With variations depending upon the specific country, we have targeted these markets for sales of retirement and related products and services, including defined
contribution pension plans, annuities and mutual funds to businesses and individuals. In some of our international markets, we complement our sales of these products with institutional asset
management and life insurance accumulation products.

We
have pursued our international strategy through a combination of start-ups, acquisitions and joint ventures, which require infusions of capital consistent with our
strategy of long-term growth and profitability.

International Asset Management and Accumulation Segment Summary Financial Data

AUM is a key indicator of earnings growth for the segment, as AUM is the base by which we can generate profits. Net cash flow and market performance are the two
main drivers of AUM growth. Net cash flow reflects our ability to attract and retain client deposits. Market performance reflects the investment returns on our underlying AUM. The percentage growth in
the earnings of our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment will generally track with the percentage growth in AUM. This trend may vary due to changes in business and/or product mix.
Our financial results are also impacted by fluctuations of the foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for the countries in which we have business.

Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006

Operating Earnings

Operating earnings increased $19.5 million primarily due to higher earnings from our equity method investments in Brazil and China and the strengthening of
the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar. Operating earnings in Chile and Hong Kong increased primarily due to higher annualized investment yields in Chile and growth in AUM in Hong Kong and Chile.

Operating Revenues

Premiums in Chile increased $31.0 million primarily due to higher sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies. This increase was partially
offset by a $23.7 million decrease in Mexico resulting from lower sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies due to our decision to not sell these annuities in Mexico in 2007 due
to unfavorable market conditions.

Fees
and other revenues in our Hong Kong, Chile and India operations increased primarily due to growth in AUM in these countries. In addition, fees and other revenues increased in Hong
Kong due to performance-based fees.

Net
investment income increased primarily due to a higher annualized yield on average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity method investments, and to a lesser extent due to a
$418.0 million increase in average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity method investments, coupled with higher earnings from our equity method subsidiaries in Brazil, China and
Malaysia. The annualized yield on average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity method investments, was 10.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 7.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2006.


Total Expenses

Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $152.1 million in Chile, primarily due to higher interest crediting rates in 2007 and increased sales of
single premium annuities with life contingencies.

Operating
expenses within our Mexican operations decreased $20.9 million primarily due to the unlocking of assumptions surrounding PVFP related to newly enacted legislation of the
mandatory privatized social security system. This decrease was partially offset by higher operating expenses in our other international operations due to continued growth.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for the segment were 14% and -16% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective income tax
rate for the year ended December 31, 2007, was lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to taxes on our share of earnings generated from our equity method investments
that are included in net investment income and the lower tax rates of foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006, was lower than the U.S.
corporate income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to tax refinements in Mexico and Chile and taxes on our share of earnings generated from our equity method investments that are included in net
investment income.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Operating Earnings

Operating earnings increased $8.2 million due to the strengthening of the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar and higher earnings from our Brazilian
equity method investment driven by growth in AUM. Additionally, operating earnings increased due to increased fees in India, Chile and Hong Kong from growth in AUM. Partially offsetting these
increases were operating expense increases due to continued growth in our international operations and decreased earnings due to lower annualized investment yields in Chile.

Operating Revenues

Premiums in Mexico decreased $12.6 million due to decreased sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies as a result of pricing changes in
2006. This decrease was partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in Chile resulting from the strengthening of the peso versus the U.S. dollar, which more than offset decreased sales of
single premium annuities with life contingencies compared to 2005.

Fees
and other revenues in our India, Hong Kong and Chile operations increased due to growth in AUM in these countries. In addition, fees and other revenues in Chile increased due to
growth in the universal life insurance
business. Partially offsetting these increases was a $5.7 million decrease in Mexico, primarily due to a refinement of accrued fee income in 2005.

Net
investment income increased primarily due to a $367.8 million increase in average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity method investments; the strengthening of the
Chilean peso and Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar; and higher earnings from our Brazilian equity method investment. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in the annualized yield on
average invested assets and cash, excluding our equity method investments, which was 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Total Expenses

Benefits, claims and settlement expenses decreased in our Chile and Mexico operations primarily due to lower interest crediting rates in 2006 and decreased sales
of single premium annuities with life contingencies in Mexico and Chile, which was partially offset by the strengthening of the Chilean peso versus U.S. dollar.

Operating
expenses increased due to continued growth in our international operations. The operating expenses for our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment grew at
approximately half the growth rate of our segment's AUM during the period.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for the segment were -16% and -7% for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective income tax
rate for the year ended December 31, 2006, was lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to tax refinements in Mexico and Chile and taxes on our share of earnings
generated from our equity method investments that are included in net investment income. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005, was lower than the U.S. corporate
income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to a tax benefit received as a result of the liquidation of our Japan joint venture, taxes on our share of earnings generated from our equity method investments
that are included in net investment income and the lower tax rates of foreign jurisdictions.


Life and Health Insurance Segment

Individual Life Insurance Trends

Our life insurance premiums are influenced by both economic and industry trends. In addition, we have experienced increased sales of universal and variable
universal life insurance as we continue to shift our marketing emphasis to universal life insurance products from traditional life insurance products. Due to this shift in marketing emphasis, premiums
related to our traditional life insurance products have declined, while fee revenues from our universal and variable universal life insurance products have grown.

Health Insurance Trends

In 2006, we experienced modest growth in group medical premium and fees and group medical members due to more competitive pricing and market focus. In
mid-2006, we implemented rate increases to improve margins. As a result, membership started to decline during the fourth quarter of 2006 and continued in 2007. We expect this trend to
continue.

Our
fee-for-service business has also been impacted by our competitive positioning. We have experienced membership declines in this business for the past two
years and we expect the declines to continue. Effective September 1, 2007, we made the Aetna Signature Administrators network available to new and renewal
fee-for-service customers. This agreement helped us retain members toward the latter part of 2007.

Specialty Benefits Insurance Trends

Premium and fee growth for our specialty benefits insurance business is being driven by solid sales and retention. This has been a result of growing, and more
focused distribution, supporting these product lines, increasing emphasis on marketing products to individuals at employer worksites ("voluntary/worksite") and the introduction of new products.

Life and Health Insurance Segment Summary Financial Data

There are several key indicators for earnings growth in our Life and Health insurance business. The ability of our distribution channels to generate new sales and
retain existing business drives growth in our block of business, premium revenue and fee revenues. Our earnings growth also depends on our ability to price our products at a level that enables us to
earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products. Factors impacting pricing decisions include competitive conditions, persistency, our
ability to assess and manage trends in mortality and morbidity experience and our ability to manage operating expenses.

Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006

Operating Earnings

Health insurance operating earnings decreased $47.7 million due to increases in the cost of medical care, unfavorable prior year claim developments and an
overall decline in covered members. These increases in cost were partially offset by increases in premium per member and lower operating expense ratios in our health insurance business. Individual
life insurance operating earnings decreased $18.8 million, due to favorable DPAC adjustments in 2006 compared to unfavorable DPAC adjustments in 2007, coupled with a decrease in investment
income from a lower asset base related to capital reductions, which more than offset growth in the universal life and variable universal life businesses. Specialty benefits insurance operating
earnings increased $5.1 million, as growth in premiums and improvement in expense ratios were partially offset by higher loss ratios.

Operating Revenues

Specialty benefits insurance premiums increased $149.0 million primarily due to growth in the business resulting from solid sales and retention in all
product lines. Health insurance premiums decreased $52.7 million, as a reduction in covered members was partially offset by an increase in premium per member. Furthermore, individual life
insurance premiums decreased $23.4 million due to the expected continued decline from the decreasing block of traditional life insurance business.

Individual
life insurance fees and other revenues increased $59.7 million due to growth in the universal life and variable universal life lines of business. This increase in fees
more than offset the decline in individual life insurance premiums.

Total Expenses

Specialty benefits insurance benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $132.4 million primarily due to growth in the business. Health insurance
benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $51.2 million, as higher claims costs per member and unfavorable prior year claim development were partially offset by a decrease in covered
members.

Individual
life insurance operating expenses increased $40.1 million primarily due to an increase in DPAC amortization, which was largely the result of unfavorable unlocking
relative to 2006 and higher amortization in 2007 due to growth in the business and higher lapses early in the year. Specialty benefits insurance operating expenses increased $14.8 million due
to continued growth in the business. Health insurance operating expenses decreased $36.2 million primarily due to staff and other reductions associated with the decline in insured medical and
fee-for-service medical covered members.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for the segment were 32% and 33% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective income tax
rates were lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35% as a result of interest exclusion from taxable income and income tax deductions allowed for corporate dividends received.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Operating Earnings

Specialty benefits insurance operating earnings increased $14.2 million due to reserve refinements in the long-term disability line, favorable
claims experience in the dental/vision product line and growth in all product lines. Health insurance operating earnings increased $1.5 million due to positive reserve refinements partially
offset by higher expense ratios in our fee for service business. Offsetting the increases was a $7.6 million decline of operating earnings within the individual life insurance business,
primarily due to more favorable DPAC unlocking in 2005 and changes in claims experience in 2006.

Operating Revenues

Health insurance premiums increased $185.8 million, primarily from increased covered medical members and higher premium per member. Specialty benefits
insurance premiums increased $180.4 million primarily due to strong sales and stable retention.

Total Expenses

Health insurance benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $155.1 million primarily due to higher claim costs per member and growth, partially
offset by reserve refinements. Despite generally lower loss ratios, specialty


benefits
insurance benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $115.7 million, primarily due to growth in the business.

Specialty
benefits insurance and health insurance operating expenses increased $46.1 million and $25.5 million, respectively, due to growth in the businesses. Partially
offsetting these increases was a $27.1 million decrease in the individual life insurance operating expenses primarily due to lower sales and changes in claims experience in 2006.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate for the segment was 33% for the each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The effective income tax rates were lower
than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to interest exclusion from taxable income.

Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006

Operating Loss

Operating loss increased primarily due to higher interest expense, largely related to the issuance of corporate debt in the fourth quarter of 2006, partially
offset by higher annualized investment yields driven by the joint venture real estate portfolio.

Operating Revenues

Operating revenues decreased primarily due to an increase in inter-segment eliminations included in this segment, which was offset by a corresponding change in
total expenses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average annualized investment yields driven by the joint venture real estate portfolio.

Total Expenses

Total expenses decreased primarily due to an increase in inter-segment eliminations included in this segment, which was offset by a corresponding change in
operating revenues. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on corporate debt and interest expense related to federal income tax activities.

Income Taxes

Income tax benefits increased primarily due to an increase in operating loss before income taxes.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Operating Loss

Operating loss increased primarily due to a full year of preferred stock dividend payments in 2006 related to the June 2005 issuance of preferred stock. Also
contributing to the increase in operating loss was higher interest expense incurred on corporate debt. These operating losses were offset by a decrease in interest expense related to federal income


tax
activities, a change in income tax reserves established for IRS tax matters and higher average annualized investment yields.

Operating Revenues

Operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase in average annualized investment yields, which were largely the result of a decrease in investment
expenses related to a variable interest in a synthetic fuel production facility. The decrease in investment expense from this investment corresponds to an increase in income taxes due to fewer
estimated synthetic fuel tax credits generated from fuel production. Partially offsetting the increase in operating revenues was an increase in inter-segment eliminations included in this segment,
which was offset by a corresponding change in total expenses. Further offsetting the increase in operating revenues was a decrease in fee revenue for transitional services provided to
CitiMortgage, Inc. in 2005 related to the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., which is mostly offset by a corresponding change in total expense.

Total Expenses

Total expenses decreased primarily due to an increase in inter-segment eliminations included in this segment, which was offset by a corresponding change in
operating revenues. Further contributing to the decrease in total expenses was a decrease in interest expense related to federal income tax activities and transitional services provided to
CitiMortgage, Inc. in 2005 related to the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc., which is mostly offset in operating revenues. The decrease in total expenses was partially offset
by additional interest on corporate debt.

Income Taxes

Income tax benefits decreased primarily due to a decrease in the estimated synthetic fuel tax credits in 2006, as well as a decrease in operating loss before
income taxes. Partially offsetting the decrease in income tax benefits was a change in income tax reserves established for IRS tax matters.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity and capital resources represent the overall strength of a company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at a competitive rate and
raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. Our legal entity organizational structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. Following is a simplified
organizational structure.

Liquidity

Our liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be met by funds from consolidated operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock,
debt or other capital securities and borrowings from credit facilities. We believe that cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of our operations,
including reasonably foreseeable contingencies. However, there can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since benefits and
surrender levels are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment, our claims paying ability and our financial strength ratings.

The Holding Companies: Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Principal Financial
Services, Inc.

The principal sources of funds available to our parent holding company, Principal Financial Group, Inc., to meet its obligations,
including the payments of dividends on common stock, debt service and the repurchase of stock, are dividends from subsidiaries as well as its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise
capital to meet operating and growth needs. Dividends from Principal Life, our primary subsidiary, are limited by Iowa law. Under Iowa laws, Principal Life may pay dividends only from the earned
surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa ("the Commissioner") to pay a stockholder dividend if such a stockholder
dividend would exceed certain statutory limitations. The current statutory limitation is the greater of (i) 10% of Principal Life's statutory


policyholder
surplus as of the previous year-end or (ii) the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year.

Iowa
law gives the Commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. Based on this limitation and 2007 statutory results, Principal Life could pay
approximately $686.5 million in stockholder dividends in 2008 without exceeding the statutory limitation.

Principal
Life could have paid approximately $660.4 million in statutory dividends in 2007 based on its 2006 statutory financial results without being subject to the restrictions
on payment of stockholder dividends. Total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent company in 2007 were $650.0 million.

Principal
Life could have paid approximately $630.7 million in statutory dividends in 2006 based on its 2005 statutory financial results without being subject to the restrictions
on payment of stockholder dividends. The ordinary stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent company in 2006 were $426.2 million. In addition, Principal Life requested and
received permission from the Commissioner to pay an extraordinary dividend in the amount of $750.0 million. The extraordinary stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent in 2006
were $750.0 million.

Principal
Life could have paid approximately $591.1 million in statutory dividends in 2005 based on its 2004 statutory financial results without being subject to the restrictions
on payment of stockholder dividends. Total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent company in 2005 were $200.0 million.

Operations.

Historically, our primary consolidated cash flow sources have been premiums from life and
health insurance products, pension and annuity deposits, asset management fee revenues, administrative services fee revenues, income from investments and proceeds from the sales or maturity of
investments. Cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries, income and other taxes, current operating expenses, payment of dividends to policyholders,
payments in connection with investments acquired, payments made to acquire subsidiaries, payments relating to policy and contract surrenders, withdrawals, policy loans, interest expense and repayment
of short-term debt and long-term debt. Our investment strategies are generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. For a
discussion of our investment objectives, strategies and a discussion of duration matching, see "Investments" as well as Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk—Interest Rate Risk".

Cash Flows.

Activity, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, provides relevant
information regarding our sources and uses of cash. The following discussion of our operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows excludes cash flows attributable to our discontinued
operations, which were as follows:

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $2,960.0 million, $2,275.5 million and $2,125.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily related to fluctuations in operational receivables and payables. The increase in cash
provided by operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily related to the payment in 2005 of an IRS deficiency related to the examination for 1999 - 2001. Also
contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities was an increase in proceeds in the net mortgage loans held for sale activity, due to the transition of our CMBS platform from
Principal Commercial Funding to a newly created entity, Principal Commercial Funding II, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This increase in cash was partially offset by a
decrease related to fluctuations in operational receivables and payables.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $4,499.2 million, $3,910.4 million and $1,481.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of mortgage loans, available-for-sale
securities and real estate as well as additional contributions in 2007 to an equity method investment with no corresponding activity in 2006. This increase was partially offset by larger acquisitions
in 2006 relative to 2007. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in sales and fewer maturities of
available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale securities. Also contributing to the increase was an
increase in mortgage loans acquired and a decrease in mortgage loans sold. The acquisition of WM Advisors, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006 also contributed to the increase in cash used in
investing activities.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $1,292.1 million, $1,586.5 million and $546.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the issuance of $600.0 million of senior notes from our shelf registration in
2006, with no


corresponding
activity in 2007 as well as a decrease in net deposits of investment contracts, offset in part by proceeds from short term debt in the current year, compared to payments of short term
debt in the previous year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the issuance of senior notes from our shelf registration in 2006 in
addition to an increase in net deposits of investment contracts and a decrease in treasury stock acquisitions in 2006 compared to 2005. Offsetting these increases in cash provided were repayments of
short-term debt, as well as the preferred stock issuance in 2005, with no corresponding activity in 2006.

Shelf Registration.

We filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which became effective on June 30, 2004. The shelf registration totals $3.0 billion, with the ability to issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock
purchase contracts and stock purchase units of PFG and trust preferred
securities of three subsidiary trusts. If we issue additional securities, we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the securities for general corporate purposes, including working capital,
capital expenditures, investments in subsidiaries, share repurchase, acquisitions and refinancing of debt, including commercial paper and other short-term indebtedness. Principal Financial
Services, Inc. unconditionally guarantees our obligations with respect to one or more series of debt securities described in the shelf registration statement. As of December 31, 2007,
there is $1.85 billion remaining under the shelf registration. For information on senior notes issued from our shelf registration, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12, Debt".

Also excludes obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans as benefit payments will be made under a funded plan and will not require company contributions or payments within a
five-year period. In addition, separate account liabilities are excluded. Separate account liabilities represent the fair market value of funds that are separately administered by us.
Generally, the separate account contract owner, rather than us, bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account liabilities are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that
arise out of any other business of ours. Net deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are not reflected in the consolidated
statement of operations. The separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets.

Purchase
obligations include material contracts where we have a non-cancelable commitment to purchase goods and services in addition to commitments to originate loans and
purchase investments.


Contractual Commitments

In connection with our banking business, we make additional commitments to extend credit, which are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no
violation of any conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. A majority of these
commitments are lines of credit and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash funding requirements. We evaluate
each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The total commitments to fund loans were $319.4 million as of December 31, 2007.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Variable Interest Entities.

We have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and
other entities where we have a variable interest as described in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Variable
Interest Entities." We do not have a direct or contingent obligation related to our unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIE") other than described below.

Retained Interests in Securitized Assets.

We, along with other contributors, sell commercial mortgage
loans in securitization transactions to trusts. As these trusts are classified as a qualifying special purpose entity, they are not subject to the VIE consolidation rules. We may retain interests in
the securitization transaction. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair values of retained interests related to the securitizations of commercial mortgage loans were $315.8 million and
$345.3 million, respectively. The investors and the securitization entities have no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The value of our retained interests is subject
primarily to credit risk.

Guarantees and Indemnifications.

For guarantee and indemnification information, see Item 8.
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications" under the caption, "Guarantees and
Indemnifications".

Financial Rating and Strength

Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall
portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), risk exposures, operating leverage, ratings and other factors.

State
laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer's risk-based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurer's solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard
formula for annually assessing RBC. The formulas for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. For
additional rating information refer to Item 1. "Business, Ratings."

Impacts of Income Taxes

The IRS has completed examinations of the U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns for 2003 and prior years. The IRS's completion of the examinations for the
years 1999 - 2001 resulted in notices of deficiency dated December 29, 2004, and March 1, 2005. We paid the deficiencies (approximately $444.0 million
for 1999 and 2000, and $1.3 million for 2001, including interest) in the first quarter of 2005 and have filed, or will file, claims for refund relating to the disputed adjustments. The
examination for the years 2002 and 2003 resulted in a refund of approximately $176.7 million (including interest) of which $161.5 million related to deficiencies previously paid as a
result of the 1999-2001 examination. We believe that we have adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution of the contested issues
could take several years while legal remedies are pursued. Consequently, we do not expect the ultimate resolution of issues in tax years 1999 - 2003 to have a material impact
on our net income. Similarly, we believe there are adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, any challenges that might arise in tax years subsequent to 2003.

In
August 2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2007-54, which provides guidance on the methodology that life insurance companies use to calculate the dividends received deduction relating
to variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts. The deduction for dividends received reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference
between our periodic effective income tax rate and the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35%. In September 2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2007-61, which suspended Revenue Ruling
2007-54, and indicated it would issue regulations to address the issues. No regulations have been proposed and we cannot predict whether any such regulations would affect our deduction for dividends
received by insurance company affiliates with respect to variable contracts.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("American Jobs Creation Act") was signed into law. The American Jobs Creation Act included a repatriation provision
granting U.S. corporations a special deduction of 85% of certain qualifying dividends from their foreign subsidiaries. A company could elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that were
repatriated in its 2005 tax year. Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act, we implemented two domestic reinvestment plans in 2005. In accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, we
elected an 85% dividend received deduction on eligible cash dividends totaling $28.8 million.


Investments

We had total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2007, of $154.5 billion, of which $64.4 billion were invested assets. The rest of our
total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk. Because we generally do not bear any investment risk on assets held in separate
accounts, the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets.

Overall Composition of Invested Assets

Invested assets as of December 31, 2007, were predominantly of high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit, industry and
geographic location. Asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products. As shown in the following table, the major categories of invested assets are
fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages. The remainder is invested in residential mortgage loans, real estate, equity securities and other assets. In addition, policy loans are included in
our invested assets.

Impairments
include $215.7 million of credit impairment write-downs and $8.4 million in realized credit recoveries on the sale of previously impaired assets. Certain
fixed maturity securities moved into a loss position during the second quarter of 2007, and we determined that we did not have the ability and intent to hold these securities. As a result, we
recognized impairment losses on these securities of $24.5 million, net of recoveries on the subsequent sale, primarily due to a change in interest rates. Credit losses include
$32.3 million in realized losses and $2.0 million in realized gains related to credit triggered sales.

(2)

Impairments
include $52.6 million of credit impairment write-downs and $1.3 million in realized credit recoveries on the sale of previously impaired assets.

(3)

Impairments
include $2.7 million in realized gains that resulted from the sale of a commercial mortgage loan for which we had credit concerns and a $9.8 million increase
in the commercial mortgage valuation allowance.

(4)

Derivatives
include $153.5 million of net unrealized losses related to mark to market adjustments on derivatives used in fair value hedges of fixed maturity securities. The
remainder of the net loss resulted primarily from mark to market adjustments on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, with the largest component being $81.1 million of net losses
on credit default swaps and the remainder relating to risk management activities.

(5)

Other
gains (losses) include a $24.6 million realized gain on the sale of stock of an equity method investment and mark to market of net realized/unrealized gains on certain
seed money investments.

U.S. Investment Operations

Of our invested assets, $60.3 billion were held by our U.S. operations. Our U.S. invested assets are managed by Principal Global Investors, a subsidiary of
Principal Life. Our primary investment objective is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters. We seek to protect policyholders' benefits by optimizing the
risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, through asset/liability matching, reducing the credit risk, avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer, maintaining
sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification. We are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk:

•

credit
risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest;

•

interest
rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves; and

•

equity
risk, relating to adverse fluctuations in a particular common stock.

Our
ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. We devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. We manage credit
risk through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. Our Investment Committee, appointed by our Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing all investment policies and approving or
authorizing all investments, except the Executive Committee of the Board must approve any investment transaction exceeding $500.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, there are ten members
on the Investment Committee, two of whom are members of our Board of Directors. The remaining members are senior management members representing various areas of our company.

We
also seek to reduce call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates in individual investments. We limit our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty
prior to maturity at the option of the issuer, and we require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk that the issuer will exercise such option. We assess option risk in all
investments we make and, when we take that risk, we price for it accordingly.

Our
Fixed Income Securities Committee, consisting of fixed income securities senior management members, approves the credit rating for the fixed maturity securities we purchase. Teams of
security analysts, organized by industry, focus either on the public or private markets and analyze and monitor these investments. In addition, we have teams who specialize in residential
mortgage-backed securities, CMBS, asset-backed securities ("ABS") and public below investment grade securities. We establish a credit reviewed list of approved public issuers to provide an efficient
way for our portfolio managers to purchase liquid bonds for which credit review has already been completed. Issuers remain on the list for one year unless removed by our analysts. Our analysts monitor
issuers on the list on a continuous basis with a formal review documented annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer. The analysis includes both fundamental and technical
factors. The fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer.

The
qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness. In addition, technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap
levels are monitored.

Our
Fixed Income Securities Committee also reviews private transactions on a continuous basis to assess the quality ratings of our privately placed investments. We regularly review our
investments to determine whether we should re-rate them, employing the following criteria:

•

material
declines in the issuer's revenues or margins;

•

significant
management or organizational changes;

•

significant
uncertainty regarding the issuer's industry;

•

debt
service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry-specific thresholds;

•

violation
of financial covenants; and

•

other
business factors that relate to the issuer.

A
dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage portfolio. We apply a variety of strategies to minimize credit risk in our
commercial mortgage loan portfolio. When considering the origination of new commercial mortgage loans, we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property, make a physical assessment of the
underlying security, conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices. We use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and a majority of existing loans
within the portfolio. The proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns.


Our
lending guidelines are designed to encourage 75% or less loan-to-value ratios and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times. We analyze investments outside of
these guidelines based on cash flow quality, tenancy and other factors. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio at origination for brick and mortar commercial mortgages in our
portfolio was 65% and the debt service coverage ratio at loan inception was 1.7 times as of December 31, 2007.

We
have limited exposure to equity risk in our common stock portfolio. Equity securities accounted for only 1% of our U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2007.

Our
investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation. In addition, we diversify our product portfolio
offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates. Those features include adjustable crediting rates, policy surrender charges and market
value adjustments on liquidations. For further information on our management of interest rate risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk."

Overall Composition of U.S. Invested Assets

U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2007, were predominantly of high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit, industry
and geographic location. Asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products. As shown in the following table, the major categories of U.S. invested
assets are fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages. The remainder is invested in residential mortgage loans, real estate, equity securities and other assets. In addition, policy loans are
included in our invested assets. The following discussion analyzes the composition of U.S. invested assets, but excludes invested assets of the participating separate accounts.

Fixed Maturity Securities

Fixed maturity securities consist of short-term investments, publicly traded debt securities, privately placed debt securities and redeemable
preferred stock, and represented 74% and 75% of total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The fixed maturity securities portfolio was comprised, based on
carrying amount, of 66% in publicly traded fixed maturity securities and 34% in privately placed fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2007, and 68% in publicly traded fixed maturity
securities and 32% in privately placed fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2006. Included in the privately placed category as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, were
$8.4 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, of securities eligible for resale to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A


under
the Securities Act of 1933. Fixed maturity securities were diversified by category of issuer as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, as shown in the following table:

We
held $9,662.7 million of mortgage-backed and ABS as of December 31, 2007, and $9,400.4 million as of December 31, 2006.

We
believe that it is desirable to hold residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification
characteristics. Our portfolio is comprised of GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC pass-through securities. In addition, our residential collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio offers structural
features that allow cash flows to be matched to our liabilities.

CMBS
provide high levels of credit protection, diversification, reduced event risk and enhanced liquidity. CMBS are predominantly comprised of rated large pool securitizations that are
individually and collectively diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion.

We
purchase ABS to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturity securities portfolio and to provide attractive returns. The principal risks in holding ABS are structural and
credit risks. Structural risks include the security's priority in the issuer's capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments.
Credit risks involve issuer/servicer risk where collateral values can become impaired in the event of servicer credit deterioration.

Our
ABS portfolio is diversified both by type of asset and by issuer. We actively monitor holdings of ABS to ensure that the risk profile of each security improves or remains consistent.
Prepayments in the ABS portfolio are, in general, insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated to such changes by call protection features. In the event that we are subject to prepayment
risk, we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those ABS. In addition, we diversify the risks of ABS by holding a diverse class of securities, which limits
our exposure to any one security.

The
international exposure in our U.S. fixed maturity securities totaled $10,046.5 million, or 23% of total fixed maturity securities, as of December 31, 2007, comprised of
corporate and foreign government fixed maturity securities. Of the $10,046.5 million as of December 31, 2007, investments totaled $2,843.1 million in the continental European
Union, $2,641.7 million in the United Kingdom, $1,059.0 million in Asia, $954.1 million in Australia, $594.6 million in South America, $340.3 million in Mexico and
$59.4 million in Japan. The remaining $1,554.3 million is invested in 24 other countries. All international fixed maturity securities held by our U.S. operations are either denominated
in U.S. dollars or have been swapped into U.S. dollar equivalents. Our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment professionals. We control
concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks, which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country. Our investment policy limits total international fixed maturity
securities investments to 18% of total statutory general account assets with a
4% limit in emerging markets. Exposure to Canada is not included in our international exposure. As of December 31, 2007, our investments in Canada totaled $1,576.4 million.

investments and HSBC paper. All non-HSBC paper has the ultimate benefit of price support protection provided by HSBC Bank, PLC. Since Principal Life Insurance Company has senior
priority in the issuer, we believe many third party bonds could be liquidated to satisfy our claim. While we calculate our exposure on a gross basis, the value we attribute to the underlying
collateral is $125.0 million.

MBIA Inc.
exposure is predominately comprised of the guarantee of underlying securities which are rated "A-" equivalent or better by the rating agencies on a stand
alone basis. The MBIA wrap guarantees performance in the event of a default of the underlying securities bringing the combined rating to AAA.

Our
top ten exposures were rated an "A" equivalent or better by the rating agencies as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, no individual
non-government issuer represented more than 1% of U.S. invested assets. HSBC Holdings PLC is no longer included in our top ten exposures due to the redemption of a
$238.0 million investment in January 2007.


Valuation
techniques for the fixed maturity securities portfolio vary by security type and the availability of market data. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the
amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized, and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results. Interactive Data Corporation or direct
broker quotes are our sources for external prices for our public bonds and those private placement securities that are actively traded in the secondary market. In cases where quoted market prices are
not available, a matrix pricing valuation approach is used. Securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by asset class, sector, rating and average life. Each pricing category is assigned
a risk spread based on studies of observable public market data or market clearing data from the investment professionals assigned to specific security classes. The expected cash flows of the security
are then discounted back at the current Treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread. Although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an
individual security within each pricing category may actually be impacted by company specific factors. Certain market events that could impact the valuation of securities include issuer credit
ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions among others. The resulting prices are then reviewed by pricing analysts. All loans placed on the "watch list" are
valued individually by the investment analysts or the analysts that focus on troubled securities ("Workout Group"). Although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those
securities, the key assumptions about risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any) and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active market. To
the extent that bonds have longer maturity dates, management's estimate of fair value may involve greater subjectivity since they involve judgment about events well into the future. Every month, there
is a comprehensive review of all impaired securities and problem loans by a group consisting of the Chief Investment Officer, the Portfolio Managers and the Workout Group. The valuation of impaired
bonds for which there is no quoted price is typically based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received. If the company is likely to continue operations, the estimate of
future cash flows is typically based on the expected operating cash flows of the
company that are available to make payments on the bonds. If the company is likely to liquidate, the estimate of future cash flows is based on an estimate of the liquidation value of its net assets.

The
Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") of the NAIC evaluates most of the fixed maturity securities that we and other U.S. insurance companies hold. The SVO evaluates the bond
investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment categories. The NAIC designations closely mirror the nationally recognized securities rating
organizations' credit ratings for marketable bonds. NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds considered investment grade by such rating organizations. Bonds are considered investment grade when rated
"Baa3" or higher by Moody's, or "BBB-" or higher by Standard & Poor's. NAIC designations 3 through 6 are referred to as below investment grade. Bonds are considered below investment
grade when rated "Ba1" or lower by Moody's, or "BB+" or lower by Standard & Poor's. As of December 31, 2007, the percentage, based on estimated fair value, of total publicly traded and
privately placed fixed maturity securities that were investment grade with an NAIC designation 1 or 2 was 95%.

We
also monitor the credit drift of our corporate fixed maturity securities portfolio. Credit drift is defined as the ratio of the percentage of rating downgrades, including defaults,
divided by the percentage of rating upgrades. We measure credit drift once each fiscal year, assessing the changes in our internally developed credit ratings that have occurred during the year.
Standard & Poor's annual credit ratings drift ratio measures the credit rating change, within a specific year, of companies that have been assigned ratings by Standard & Poor's. The
annual internal credit drift ratio on corporate fixed maturity securities we held in our general account was 0.89 times compared to the Standard & Poor's drift ratio of 0.69 times, as of
December 31, 2007.


The
following table presents our total fixed maturity securities by NAIC designation and the equivalent ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, as well as the percentage, based on estimated fair value, that each designation comprises:

We believe that our long-term fixed maturity securities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded
and privately placed securities. Each year, we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturity securities. Our current policy is to limit the percentage of cash flow
invested in below investment grade assets to 7% of cash flow. As of December 31, 2007, we had invested 3.7% of new cash flow for the year in below investment grade assets. While the general
account investment returns have improved due to the below investment grade asset class, we manage its growth strategically by limiting it to 10% of the total fixed maturity securities portfolios.

We
invest in privately placed fixed maturity securities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable
quality public market securities. Generally, private placements provide broader access to management information, strengthened negotiated protective covenants, call protection features and, where
applicable, a higher level of collateral. They are, however, generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets.

The
following table shows the carrying amount of our corporate fixed maturity securities by Salomon industry category, as well as the percentage of the total corporate portfolio that
each Salomon industry category comprises as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

We monitor any decline in the credit quality of fixed maturity securities through the designation of "problem securities", "potential problem
securities" and "restructured securities". We define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities: (i) as to which principal and/or interest payments are in default or where
default is perceived to be imminent in the near term, or (ii) issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities. We define potential problem
securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal "watch list" for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment
terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured. The decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant
subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer. We define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as
securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered. We determine that restructures should
occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows. If at the
time of restructure, the present value of the new future cash flows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured, a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost
basis is established.

We
have a process in place to identify securities that could potentially have a credit impairment that is other than temporary. This process involves monitoring market events that could
impact issuers' credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions and other similar factors. This process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels,
downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.

Every
month, a group of individuals including the Chief Investment Officer, our Portfolio Managers, members of our Workout Group and representatives from Investment Accounting review all
securities to determine whether an other than temporary decline in value exists and whether losses should be recognized. The analysis focuses on each issuer's ability to service its debts in a timely
fashion and the length of time the security has been trading below cost. Formal documentation of the analysis and our decision is prepared and approved by management.

We
consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest-rate related impairment of a security is other than temporary. Relevant facts and
circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and
access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events; and (4) our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time that allows for the
recovery in value which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. To the extent we determine that a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, the difference between amortized cost and
fair value would be charged to net income.

There
are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring credit impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks
and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that
issuer, (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk that our investment professionals are
making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and
circumstances lead us to change our intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Any of these situations could result in a charge to earnings in a future period.

Due
to the credit disruption in the last half of 2007 that led to reduced liquidity and wider credit spreads, we saw an increase in realized and unrealized losses in our securities
portfolio. The losses were more pronounced in structured products such as collateralized debt obligations and ABS. The decline in value in large part reflects the illiquid markets.

The
net realized loss relating to other than temporary credit impairments of fixed maturity securities was $207.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The largest
portion of this loss relates to collateralized debt obligations with sub-prime exposure and certain structured residual interest securities. Certain fixed maturity securities moved into a
loss position during the second quarter of 2007, and we determined that we did not have the ability and intent to hold these securities. As a result, we recognized impairment losses on these
securities of $24.5 million, net of recoveries on the subsequent sale, primarily due to a change in interest rates.

For
the year ended December 31, 2007, we realized $34.6 million of gross losses upon disposal of bonds excluding hedging adjustments. Included in this $34.6 million
is $32.3 million related to sales of forty-two credit impaired and credit related names. We generally intend to hold securities in unrealized loss positions until they mature or
recover. However, we do sell bonds under certain circumstances such as when we have evidence of a significant deterioration in the issuer's creditworthiness, when a change in regulatory requirements
modifies what constitutes a permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. Sales
generate both gains and losses.

Mortgage Loans

Mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. At December 31, 2007, commercial mortgage loans aggregated to
$10,763.5 million. Commercial mortgage loans on real estate are generally reported at cost


adjusted
for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of
cost or fair value, less cost to sell, and reported as mortgage loans in the statements of financial position.

Commercial
mortgages play an important role in our investment strategy by:

•

providing
strong risk-adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives;

•

enhancing
total returns; and

•

providing
strategic portfolio diversification.

As
a result, we have focused on constructing a solid, high quality portfolio of mortgages. Our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages with conservative
loan-to-value ratios, high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy.

Our
commercial loan portfolio consists of primarily non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties. The mortgage portfolio is comprised of
general-purpose industrial properties, manufacturing office properties and credit oriented retail properties.

Credit
extensions in the state of California accounted for 18% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2007. We are, therefore, exposed to potential losses
resulting from the risk of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may affect the region. Like other lenders, we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make
commercial mortgage loans. With respect to California properties, however, we obtain an engineering report specific to each property. The report assesses the building's design specifications, whether
it has been upgraded to meet seismic building codes and the maximum loss that is likely to result from a variety of different seismic events. We also obtain a report that assesses, by building and
geographic fault lines, the amount of loss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio might suffer under a variety of seismic events.

Our
commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified by borrower. As of December 31, 2007, 33% of the U.S. commercial mortgage loan portfolio was comprised of mortgage loans with
principal balances of less than $10.0 million. The total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 1,254 and 1,262, respectively. The average
loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was $8.6 million as of December 31, 2007.

We
actively monitor and manage our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Substantially all loans within the portfolio are analyzed regularly and are internally rated, based on a
proprietary risk rating cash flow model, in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets. Based on ongoing monitoring, mortgage loans with a likelihood of becoming delinquent are identified
and placed on an internal "watch list". Among criteria which would indicate a potential problem are: imbalances in ratios of loan to value or contract rents to debt service, major tenant vacancies or
bankruptcies, borrower sponsorship problems, late payments, delinquent taxes and loan relief/restructuring requests.

We
review our mortgage loan portfolio and analyze the need for a valuation allowance for any loan which is delinquent for 60 days or more, in process of foreclosure, restructured,
on the "watch list", or which currently has a valuation allowance. We categorize loans, which are delinquent, loans in process of foreclosure, and loans to borrowers in bankruptcy as "problem" loans.
Potential problem loans are loans placed on an internal "watch list" for which management has concerns as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms and which may
result in the loan becoming a problem or being restructured. The decision whether to classify a performing loan as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the
likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower. We categorize loans for which the original terms of the mortgages have been modified or for which interest or principal
payments have been deferred as "restructured" loans. We also consider matured loans that are refinanced at below market rates as restructured.

The
valuation allowance for commercial mortgage loans includes a loan specific allowance for impaired loans and a provision for losses based on past loss experience believed to be
adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses. The changes in this valuation allowance are reported in net income on our consolidated statements of operations.

Commercial
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we determine that a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established or a direct write-down of the loan is recorded for the
difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value. Estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or fair value of the collateral. When a valuation allowance is established, subsequent recoveries are charged to the valuation allowance and
subsequent losses may be charged to the valuation allowance or as a direct write-down of the loan.

The
determination of the calculation and the adequacy of the mortgage loan loss provision based on past experience and mortgage impairments are subjective. Our periodic evaluation and
assessment of the adequacy of the provision for losses and the need for mortgage impairments is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's
ability to repay, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, loss experience and other relevant factors. The current portfolio
statistics and past loss experience produced a provision for the Principal Life general account totaling $30.6 million. The evaluation of our impaired loan component of the allowance is
subjective, as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Our financial position is sensitive to changes in estimated cash


flows
from mortgages, the value of the collateral and changes in the economic environment in general. The valuation allowance increased by $10.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2007, and decreased by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Equity Real Estate

We hold commercial equity real estate as part of our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amount of equity real estate
investment was $859.6 million and $801.4 million, or 1% of U.S. invested assets. Our commercial equity real estate is held in the form of wholly owned real estate, real estate acquired
upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans and majority owned interests in real estate joint ventures.

Equity
real estate is categorized as either "real estate held for investment" or "real estate held for sale." Real estate held for investment totaled $777.2 million as of
December 31, 2007, and $683.2 million as of December 31, 2006. The carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Such impairment adjustments are recorded as realized investment losses and accordingly, are reflected in
our consolidated results of operations. For
the year ended December 31, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006, there were no such impairment adjustments.

The
carrying amount of real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2007 was $82.4 million. There was no valuation allowance at December 31, 2007. The carrying
amount of real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2006 was $118.2 million, net of valuation allowance $4.7 million. Once we identify a real estate property to be sold and
commence a plan for marketing the property, we classify the property as held for sale. We establish a valuation allowance subject to periodic revisions, if necessary, to adjust the carrying value of
the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the fair value, less associated selling costs.

We
use research, both internal and external, to recommend appropriate product and geographic allocations and changes to the equity real estate portfolio. We monitor product, geographic
and industry diversification separately and together to determine the most appropriate mix.

Equity
real estate is distributed across geographic regions of the country with larger concentrations in the South Atlantic, West South Central and Pacific regions of the United States
as of December 31, 2007. By property type, there is a concentration in office and industrial site buildings that represented approximately 56% of the equity real estate portfolio as of
December 31, 2007.


Other Investments

Our other investments totaled $1,391.4 million as of December 31, 2007, compared to $972.6 million as of December 31, 2006.
Derivatives accounted for $1,067.3 million in other investments as of December 31, 2007. The remaining invested assets include equity method investments, which include properties owned
jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners.

International Investment Operations

Of our invested assets, $4.1 billion were held by our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment as of December 31, 2007. Our
international investment operations consist of the investments of Principal International. Principal Global Investors advises each Principal International affiliate on investment policies and
strategies that are consistent with the products they offer. Due to the regulatory constraints in each country, each company maintains its own investment policies. As shown in the following table, the
major categories of international invested assets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, were fixed maturity securities, other investments and residential mortgage loans:

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk Exposures and Risk Management

Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in
interest rates, although we also have exposures to changes in equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates.

The
active management of market risk is an integral part of our operations. We manage our overall market risk exposure within established risk tolerance ranges by using the following
approaches:

•

rebalance
our existing asset or liability portfolios;

•

control
the risk structure of newly acquired assets and liabilities; or

•

use
derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets or liabilities or assets expected to be purchased.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. One source of interest rate risk is the inherent
difficulty in obtaining assets that mature or have their rate reset at the exact same time as the liabilities they support. Assets may have to be reinvested or sold in the future to meet the liability
cash flows in unknown interest rate environments. Also, there may be timing differences between when new liabilities are priced and when assets are purchased or procured that can cause fluctuations in
profitability if interest rates move materially in the interim. A third source of interest rate risk is the prepayment options embedded within asset and liability contracts that can alter the cash
flow profiles from what was originally expected.


One
of the measures we use to quantify our exposure to interest rate risk is duration. To calculate duration, we project asset and liability cash flows. These cash flows are discounted
to a net present value basis using a spot yield curve, which is a blend of the spot yield curves for each of the asset types in the portfolio. Duration is calculated by re-calculating
these cash flows, re-determining the net present value based upon an alternative level of interest rates, and determining the percentage change in fair value.

We
manage interest rate risks in a number of ways. Differences in durations between assets and liabilities are measured and kept within acceptable tolerances. Derivatives are also
commonly used to mitigate interest rate risk due to cash flow mismatches and timing differences. Prepayment risk is controlled by limiting our exposure to investments that are prepayable without
penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. We also require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk the issuer will exercise such option. Prepayment risk is also
controlled by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised against the company at inopportune times.

Duration-Managed.

Our exposure to interest rate risk stems largely from our substantial holdings of guaranteed fixed rate
liabilities in our U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation segment. We actively manage the duration of assets and liabilities in these products by minimizing the difference between the two. We have
established a maximum tolerance for this difference and seek to stay within this tolerance.

As
of December 31, 2007, the difference between the asset and liability durations on our primary duration-managed portfolio was -.01. This duration gap indicates that, as of this
date, the sensitivity of the fair value of our assets to interest rate movements is less than that of the fair value of our liabilities. Our goal is to minimize the duration gap. Currently, our
guidelines indicate that total duration gaps between the asset and liability portfolios should be within +/-0.25. The value of the assets in this portfolio was $33,183.4 million as
of December 31, 2007.

Duration-Monitored.

For products such as whole life insurance and term life insurance that are less sensitive to interest
rate risk, and for other products such as individual single premium deferred annuities, we manage interest rate risk based on a modeling process that considers the target average life, maturities,
crediting rates and assumptions of policyholder behavior. As of December 31, 2007, the weighted-average difference between the asset and liability durations on these portfolios was +.22. This
duration gap indicates that, as of this date, the sensitivity of the fair value of our assets to interest rate movements is greater than that of the fair value of our liabilities. We attempt to
monitor this duration gap consistent with our overall risk/reward tolerances. The value of the assets in these portfolios was $17,990.9 million as of December 31, 2007.

Non Duration-Managed.

We also have a block of participating general account pension business that passes most of the actual
investment performance of the assets to the customer. The investment strategy of this block is to maximize investment return to the customer on a "best efforts" basis, and there is little or no
attempt to manage the duration of this portfolio since there is little or no interest rate risk. The value of the assets in these portfolios was $5,234.0 million as of December 31, 2007.

Using
the assumptions and data in effect as of December 31, 2007, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates decreases the net fair value of
our portfolio by approximately $36.3 million. The following table details the estimated changes by risk management strategy. The table also gives the weighted-average duration of the asset
portfolio for each category, and the net duration gap (i.e., the weighted-average difference between the asset and liability durations).

Our
selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase or decrease in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario we use to demonstrate potential risk. While a 100 basis
point immediate, parallel increase does not
represent our view of future market changes, it is a near term reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. While these fair value measurements provide
a representation of interest rate sensitivity, they are based on our portfolio exposures at a point in time and may not be representative of future market results. These exposures will change as a
result of ongoing portfolio transactions in response to new business, management's assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities.


Debt Issued and Outstanding.

As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate fair value of long-term debt was
$1,423.6 million. A 100 basis point immediate, parallel decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $106.3 million. Debt is not recorded at fair
value on the statement of financial position.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk.

We use various derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, treasury lock agreements and options. We use interest rate swaps and futures contracts to hedge changes in interest
rates subsequent to the issuance of an insurance liability, such as a guaranteed investment contract, but prior to the purchase of a supporting asset, or during periods of holding assets in
anticipation of near term liability sales. We use interest rate swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities. They can be used to change the
sensitivity to the interest rate of specific assets and liabilities as well as an entire portfolio. We have also used these instruments to hedge the interest rate exposure in our CMBS operations.
Occasionally, we will sell a callable investment-type agreement and will use written interest rate swaptions to transform the callable liability into a fixed term liability.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk arises from foreign
currency-denominated funding agreements issued to non-qualified institutional investors in the international market, foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities and demand
deposits purchased and our international operations.

We
estimate that as of December 31, 2007, a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would result in no material
change to the net fair value of our foreign currency denominated instruments identified above because we effectively hedge foreign currency denominated instruments to minimize exchange rate impacts.
The selection of a 10% immediate unfavorable change in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential
impact of such an event.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Foreign Currency Risk.

The foreign currency risk on funding agreements and fixed maturity
securities is mitigated by using currency swaps that swap the foreign currency interest and principal payments to our functional currency. The notional amount of our currency swap agreements
associated with foreign-denominated liabilities as of December 31, 2007, was $4,351.7 million. The notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with foreign-denominated
fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2007, was $1,973.4 million.

With
regard to our international operations, we attempt to do as much of our business as possible in the functional currency of the country of operation. At times, however, we are unable
to do so, and in these cases, we use foreign exchange derivatives to economically hedge the resulting risks. As of December 31, 2007, our operations in Chile had currency swaps with a notional
amount of $24.1 million that are used to swap cash flows on U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to a local currency. Chile also utilized currency forwards with a notional amount of
$134.1 million in order to mitigate currency exposure related to bonds denominated in currencies other than Chilean pesos.

Additionally,
we may take measures to hedge our net equity investments in our foreign subsidiaries from currency risks. Currently, there are no outstanding net equity investment hedges.

Equity Risk

Equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in a particular common stock. As of December 31, 2007, the fair
value of our equity securities was $586.2 million. A 10% decline in the value of the equity securities would result in an unrealized loss of $58.6 million. The selection of a 10%
unfavorable change in the equity markets should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event.


We
also have equity risk associated with (1) fixed deferred annuity products that credit interest to customers based on changes in an external equity index; (2) variable
annuity contracts that have a GMWB rider that allows the customer to receive at least the principal deposit back through withdrawals of a specified annual amount, even if the account value is reduced
to zero; (3) variable annuity contacts that have a GMDB that allows the death benefit to be paid, even if the account value has fallen below the GMDB amount;
(4) investment-type contracts in which the return is tied to an external equity index; and (5) investment-type contracts in which the return is subject to minimum
contractual guarantees.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Equity Risk.

We economically hedge the fixed deferred annuity product by purchasing options that
match the product's profile. We economically hedge the GMWB exposure using futures, options and interest rate swaps. We economically hedge the investment contract exposure to an external equity index
using equity call options.

Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest. Our ability to
manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Investments" for
additional information about credit risk.

Use of Derivatives to Diversify or Hedge Credit Risk.

We sometimes purchase credit default swaps to hedge credit exposures in
our investment portfolio. We sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors. If there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the
referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security.

We
economically hedged credit exposure in our portfolio by purchasing credit default swaps with a notional amount of $63.4 million at December 31, 2007. We also utilized
credit default swaps with a notional amount of $69.5 million at December 31, 2007, to economically hedge spread risk in our portfolio. We have credit exposure through credit default
swaps with a notional amount of $200.0 million as of December 31, 2007, by investing $200.0 million in various
tranches of synthetic collateralized debt obligations. In addition, we sold credit default swaps creating replicated assets with a notional amount of $801.9 million as of December 31,
2007.

Derivative Summary

Notional amounts are used to express the extent of our involvement in derivative transactions and represent a standard measurement of the volume of our derivative
activity. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the statement of financial position. Notional amounts represent those amounts
used to calculate contractual flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for contracts such as currency swaps. Actual credit exposure represents the amount owed to us under derivative
contracts as of the valuation date. The following tables present our position in, and credit exposure to, derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Counterparty Risk

In conjunction with our use of derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty risk, or the risk that the counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative
contract. We actively manage this risk by:

•

establishing
exposure limits which take into account non-derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure;

•

performing
similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long-term basis;

•

diversifying
our risk across numerous approved counterparties;

•

limiting
exposure to A+ credit or better;

•

conducting
stress-test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction;

•

implementing
credit support annex (collateral) agreements with selected counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures; and

•

daily
monitoring of counterparty credit ratings.

All
new derivative counterparties are approved by the Investment Committee. We believe the risk of incurring losses due to nonperformance by our counterparties is manageable.

Effects of Inflation

We do not believe that inflation, in the United States or in the other countries in which we operate, has had a material effect on our annual consolidated
operations over the past five years; however, in the future we may be materially affected by inflation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

We
have audited Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("the COSO criteria"). Management of Principal Financial
Group, Inc. ("the Company") is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Principal Financial Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Principal
Financial Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("the Company") as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Principal Financial Group, Inc. at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in response to new accounting standards, the Company changed its methods of accounting for certain
non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets (primarily real estate) effective July 1, 2005, its pension and other post-retirement benefits effective
December 31, 2006, and for the treatment of modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts and income tax contingencies effective January 1, 2007.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
our report dated February 19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2007

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("PFG"), along with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a diversified financial services organization engaged in promoting
retirement savings and investment and insurance products and services in the U.S. and selected international markets.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which include our majority-owned subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"), have been
prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). Less than majority-owned entities in which we had at least a 20% interest and limited liability
companies ("LLCs"), partnerships and real estate joint ventures in which we had at least a 5% interest, are reported on the equity basis in the consolidated statements of financial position as other
investments. Investments in LLCs, partnerships and real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership percentage of 3% to 5% are accounted for under the equity or cost method depending
upon the specific facts and circumstances of our ownership and involvement. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Information included in the notes to the
financial statements excludes information applicable to less than majority-owned entities reported on the equity and cost methods, unless otherwise noted.

Closed Block

Principal Life Insurance Company ("Principal Life") operates a closed block ("Closed Block") for the benefit of individual participating dividend-paying policies
in force at the time of the 1998 mutual insurance holding company ("MIHC") formation. See Note 9, Closed Block, for further details.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported and disclosed. These estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On December 4, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("the FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141R,

Business Combinations

("SFAS 141R"). This statement was a joint project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board whose
objectives were to improve and simplify the accounting for business combinations and to develop a single high-quality standard of accounting for business combinations that could be used
for both domestic and international financial reporting. Among the changes, the standard requires that the acquiring entity in a business combination establish the
acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any noncontrolling interests, and requires the acquirer to disclose to
investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. In addition, SFAS 141R requires direct
acquisition costs to be expensed. This statement is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. All requirements of SFAS 141R should be
applied prospectively.

Also
on December 4, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

("SFAS 160"). Under this statement, noncontrolling interests are to be treated as a separate component of equity,
rather than as a liability or other item outside of equity. In addition, SFAS 160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented. Net income will include the total income of all
consolidated subsidiaries, with separate disclosures on the face of the income statement of the income attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests. Previously, net income attributable to
the noncontrolling interest was reported as an operating expense in arriving at consolidated net income. Finally, SFAS 160 revises the accounting requirements for changes in a parent's
ownership interest while the parent retains control and for changes in a parent's ownership interest that results in deconsolidation. This statement is effective for the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Presentation and disclosure requirements should be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. All other requirements of SFAS 160 should
be applied prospectively. We are still evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

On
June 11, 2007, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the "AICPA") issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 07-1,

Clarification
of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide "Investment Companies" and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies

("SOP 07-1"). This SOP provides guidance for determining whether an entity is within the scope of the AICPA

Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment
Companies

(the "Guide"). This SOP also addresses whether the specialized industry accounting principles of the Guide should be retained by a parent company in consolidation or
by an investor that has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investment company and applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in the entity. In addition, this SOP
includes certain disclosure requirements for parent companies and equity method investors in investment companies that retain investment company accounting in the parent company's consolidated
financial statements or the financial statements of an equity method investor. The provisions of this SOP were effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2007. However, on
February 14, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") SOP 07-1-1,

Effective Date of AICPA Statement of Position 07-1

, to
indefinitely defer the effective date of SOP 07-1.

On
February 15, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159

, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 115

("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option is elected shall be reported in net
income. The decision about whether to elect the fair value option (1) is applied instrument by instrument, with certain exceptions; (2) is irrevocable; and (3) is applied to an
entire instrument and not only to specified risks, specific cash flows, or portions of that instrument. SFAS 159 also requires additional disclosures that are intended to facilitate comparisons
between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities and between assets and liabilities in the financial statements of an entity that selects different
measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. At the effective date,
the fair value option may be elected for eligible items that exist at that date and the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value for those items should be reported as a cumulative effect
adjustment to retained earnings. We do not anticipate that SFAS 159 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, election of this option could introduce period
to period volatility in net income.

The
FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R

("SFAS 158"), on September 29, 2006. SFAS 158 requires an entity to recognize in its statement of financial position an
asset for a defined benefit postretirement plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status. This statement eliminates the ability to choose a measurement date, by requiring
that plan assets and benefit obligations be measured as of the annual balance sheet date. The requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and the disclosure
requirements were effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The requirement to measure plan assets
and benefit obligations as of the annual balance sheet date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. See Note 14, Employee and Agent Benefits, for further details
relating to our benefit plans.

On
September 15, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

("SFAS 157"). This standard, which provides
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, but does not expand the use of
fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data,
and requires fair value measurements to be separately disclosed by level within the hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of Statement No 157

, to
defer the effective date of the standard for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. On
February 14, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-1,

Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements
That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement Under Statement 13

, which amends SFAS 157 to exclude instruments covered
by SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, and its related interpretive guidance from the scope of SFAS 157. We do not anticipate that
SFAS 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The
staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") published Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108,

Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

("SAB 108"), on September 13, 2006. SAB 108 addresses
quantifying the financial statement effects


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

of
misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. Under SAB 108,
registrants are required to quantify the effects on the current year financial statements of correcting all misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing effects of uncorrected prior year
misstatements. After considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, if a misstatement is material, a registrant's prior year financial statements must be restated. SAB 108 was
effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006, and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

On
July 13, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

("FIN 48"). FIN 48, which is an interpretation of SFAS No. 109

, Accounting for Income Taxes

, prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. FIN 48 requires the affirmative evaluation that
it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of a tax position, that an enterprise is entitled to economic benefits resulting from positions taken in income tax returns. If a tax position
does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
requires companies to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information in their financial statements about uncertain tax positions. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007,
which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 13, Income Taxes, for further details.

On
March 17, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets

("SFAS 156"), which
amends SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

("SFAS 140"). This
Statement (1) requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or liability each time it undertakes
an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in specified situations, (2) requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially
measured at fair value, (3) for subsequent measurement of each class of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities, an entity can elect either the amortization or fair value
measurement method, (4) permits a one-time reclassification of available-for-sale ("AFS") securities to trading securities by an entity with recognized
servicing rights, without calling into question the treatment of other AFS securities, provided the AFS securities are identified in some manner as offsetting the entity's exposure to changes in fair
value of servicing assets or liabilities that a servicer elects to subsequently measure at fair value, and (5) requires separate presentation of servicing assets and liabilities measured at
fair value in the statement of financial position and also requires additional disclosures. The initial measurement requirements of this Statement should be applied prospectively to all transactions
entered into after the fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006. The election related to the subsequent measurement of servicing assets and liabilities is also effective the first fiscal
year beginning after September 15, 2006. We adopted SFAS 156 effective January 1, 2007, and have not elected to subsequently measure any of our servicing rights at fair value or
reclassify any AFS securities to trading. The prospective aspects of SFAS 156 are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

On
February 16, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments — an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 133 and 140

("SFAS 155"), which amends SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

("SFAS 133") and SFAS 140. SFAS 155 (1) permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded
derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, (2) clarifies which interest-only and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133,
(3) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain
an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, (4) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives, and (5) amends SFAS 140
to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
instrument. This Statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity's fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. At adoption, the
fair value election may also be applied to hybrid financial instruments that have been bifurcated under SFAS 133 prior to adoption of this Statement. We adopted SFAS 155 on
January 1, 2007, and did not apply the fair value election to any existing hybrid financial instruments that had been bifurcated under SFAS 133 prior to adoption of SFAS 155. The
prospective aspects of SFAS 155 are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

On
September 19, 2005, the AICPA issued SOP 05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With
Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts

("SOP 05-1"). The AICPA defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features,
rights, or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract.
An internal replacement that is determined to result in a replacement contract that is substantially


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

unchanged
from the replaced contract should be accounted for as a continuation of the replaced contract. Contract modifications resulting in a replacement contract that is substantially changed from
the replaced contract should be accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract and any unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs ("DPAC"), unearned revenue liabilities, and deferred
sales inducement costs from the replaced contract should be written off and acquisition costs on the new contracts deferred as appropriate. This SOP is effective for internal replacements occurring in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. As of January 1, 2007, we adopted SOP 05-1, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

On
May 30, 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3

("SFAS 154"), which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Under
SFAS 154, a change in accounting principle should be retrospectively applied to all prior periods, unless it is impracticable to do so. This retrospective application requirement replaces the
Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

("APB 20"), requirement to recognize changes in accounting
principle by including the cumulative effect of the change in net income during the current period. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles where we are changing to a
more preferable accounting method, as well as to changes required by an accounting
pronouncement that does not contain specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 carries forward without change the guidance contained in APB 20 for reporting the correction of an error in
previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate. SFAS 154 was effective for accounting changes on or after January 1, 2006.

On
December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earning Repatriation Provision
within the American Jobs Creation Act of 20

04 ("FSP 109-2"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was enacted on October 22, 2004, and introduces, among
other things, a special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer ("repatriation provision"), provided certain criteria are
met. FSP 109-2 was issued to allow additional time for companies to determine whether any foreign earnings will be repatriated under the Act's repatriation provision, given the law was
enacted late in the year and certain provisions were unclear. FSP 109-2 was effective for the year ended December 31, 2004. In 2005, we elected a dividends received deduction under
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. See Note 13, Income Taxes, for further details.

December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

("SFAS 123R").
SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements. SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

("SFAS 123"), supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees

("APB 25"), and SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure — an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

. On April 14, 2005, the
SEC approved a new rule delaying the effective date of SFAS 123R to annual periods that begin after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, we adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1,
2006 using the modified-prospective method.

The
provisions of our stock awards allow approved retirees to retain all or a portion of their awards if they retire prior to the end of the required service period. SFAS 123R
considers this to be a nonsubstantive service condition. Accordingly, it is appropriate to recognize compensation cost either immediately for stock awards granted to retirement eligible employees, or
over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if retirement eligibility is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. Prior to adopting
SFAS 123R, our approach was to follow the widespread practice of recognizing compensation cost over the explicit service period (up to the date of actual retirement). For any awards that are
granted after our adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, we recognize compensation cost through the period that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required
to provide service to earn the award. If we had applied the nonsubstantive vesting provisions of SFAS 123R to awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, our consolidated financial
statements would not have been materially impacted.

SFAS 123R
requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. This
requirement reduces net operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date.

Under
the modified-prospective method, any excess income tax deduction realized for awards accounted for under SFAS 123R (regardless of the type of award or the jurisdiction in
which the tax benefit is generated) is eligible to absorb write-offs of deferred income tax assets for any awards accounted for under SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R does not require
separate pools of excess income tax benefits for separate types of awards, rather the excess income tax benefits of employee and nonemployee awards may be combined in a single pool of excess tax
benefits. Our policy is to pool the employee and nonemployee awards together in this manner. Deferred income tax asset write-offs resulting from deficient

deductions
on employee awards may be offset against previous excess income tax benefits arising from nonemployee awards, and vice versa.

This
Statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we began expensing all stock options using a fair-value based method effective for
the year beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, any stock options granted prior to January 1, 2002 were fully vested at the time of adoption of SFAS 123R. We use the
Black-Scholes formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees. We applied the prospective method of transition as prescribed by SFAS 123 when we elected to begin expensing
stock-based compensation in 2002. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as a result of adopting SFAS 123R was immaterial. Therefore, the pre-tax cumulative
effect of the change in accounting principle is reflected in operating expenses. See Note 20, Stock-Based Compensation Plans, for further details.

In
December, 2004, SFAS No. 153,

Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

("SFAS 153"), was
issued. APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

("APB 29"), provided the basic principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. However, APB 29 provided an exception that allowed certain exchanges of similar productive assets to be recorded at
book value. SFAS 153 amends APB 29 to eliminate this exception and requires non-monetary exchanges that meet certain criteria to be accounted for at fair value. We adopted
SFAS 153 and are applying its guidelines to nonmonetary exchanges occurring on or after July 1, 2005.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt issues with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased.

Investments

Fixed maturity securities include bonds, mortgage-backed securities and redeemable preferred stock. Equity securities include mutual funds, common stock and
nonredeemable preferred stock. We classify fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading at the time of the purchase and, accordingly,
carry them at fair value. (See Note 17, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for policies related to the determination of fair value.) Unrealized gains and losses related to
available-for-sale securities, excluding those in fair value hedging relationships, are reflected in stockholders' equity, net of adjustments related to DPAC, sales
inducements, unearned revenue reserves, policyholder dividend obligation ("PDO"), derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships and applicable income taxes. Unrealized gains and losses related to
trading securities and available-for-sale securities in fair value hedging relationships are reflected in net income as net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses).

The
cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, both computed using the interest method. The cost of fixed maturity securities
and equity securities is adjusted for declines in value that are other than temporary. Impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary are reported in net income as a component of net
realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). For loan-backed and structured securities, we recognize income using a constant effective yield based on currently anticipated prepayments using
a tool that models the prepayment behavior of the underlying collateral based on the current interest rate environment.

Real
estate investments are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. The initial cost bases of properties acquired through loan foreclosures are the lower of the fair market
values of the properties at the time of foreclosure or the outstanding loan balance. Buildings and land improvements are generally depreciated on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of improvements, and tenant improvement costs are
depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of the related lease. We recognize impairment losses for properties when indicators of impairment are present and a property's
expected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the property's carrying value. In such cases, the cost bases of the properties are reduced to fair value. Real estate expected to be
disposed is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with valuation allowances established accordingly and depreciation no longer recognized. The carrying amount of real estate
held for sale was $82.4 million and $118.2 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Any impairment losses and any changes in valuation allowances are reported in
net income.

Commercial
and residential mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method, net of
valuation allowances, and direct write-downs for impairment. Any changes in the valuation allowances are reported in net income as net realized/unrealized capital gains


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

(losses).
We measure impairment based upon the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the loan's observable market price. If foreclosure is probable,
the measurement of any valuation allowance is based upon the fair value of the collateral. We have commercial mortgage loans held-for-sale in the amount of $2.9 million
and $77.3 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, and reported as mortgage loans in the statements of
financial position.

Net
realized capital gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on the basis of specific identification. In general, in addition to realized capital gains and losses on
investment sales and periodic settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges, unrealized gains and losses related to other than temporary impairments, trading securities, certain seed money
investments, fair value hedge ineffectiveness, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in the mortgage loan allowance and impairments of
real estate held for investment are reported in net income as net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). Investment gains and losses on sales of certain real estate
held-for-sale, which do not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation, are reported as net investment income and are excluded from net
realized/unrealized capital gains (losses).

Policy
loans and other investments, excluding investments in unconsolidated entities, are primarily reported at cost.

Securitizations

We, along with other contributors, sell commercial mortgage loans to trusts that, in turn, securitize the assets. As these trusts are classified as qualifying
special purpose entities ("QSPE"), we recognize the gain on the sale of the loans to the trust and the trusts are not required to be consolidated. There is significant judgment used to determine
whether a trust is a QSPE. To maintain QSPE status, the trust must continue to meet the QSPE criteria both initially and in subsequent periods. We have analyzed the governing pooling and servicing
agreements for each of our securitizations and believe that the terms are industry standard and are consistent with the QSPE criteria. If at any time we determine a trust no longer qualifies as a
QSPE, each trust will need to be reviewed to determine if there is a need to recognize the commercial mortgage loan asset in the statement of financial position along with the offsetting liability.

Derivatives

Overview.

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivatives generally used by us include interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, currency swaps, currency forwards, credit default
swaps, interest rate lock commitments, treasury lock agreements, commodity swaps and options. Derivatives may be exchange traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market.
Derivative positions are either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position and are measured at fair value, generally by obtaining quoted market prices or through the
use of pricing models. Fair values can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, values of securities, credit spreads, and market volatility and liquidity.

Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation.

We designate derivatives as either:

(a)

a
hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, including those denominated in a foreign currency ("fair
value" hedge);

(b)

a
hedge of a forecasted transaction or the exposure to variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability, including those denominated in a
foreign currency ("cash flow" hedge);

(c)

a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or

(d)

a
derivative not designated as a hedging instrument.

Our
accounting for the ongoing changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the designation, as described above, and is determined when the
derivative contract is entered into or at the time of redesignation under SFAS 133. Hedge accounting is used for derivatives that are specifically designated in advance as hedges and that
reduce our exposure to an indicated risk by having a high correlation between changes in the value of the derivatives and the items being hedged at both the inception of the hedge and throughout the
hedge period.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Fair Value Hedges.

When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is determined to be
highly effective, changes in its fair value, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk, are reported in net
realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). Any difference between the net change in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item represents hedge ineffectiveness.

Cash Flow Hedges.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is determined to be highly
effective, changes in its fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in net income. At the time the variability of cash
flows being hedged impact net income, the related portion of deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument is reclassified and reported in net income.

Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Hedges.

When a derivative is used as a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation, its change in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded
immediately in net income. If the foreign operation is sold or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation, the deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reclassified into net
income.

Non-Hedge Derivatives.

If a derivative does not qualify or is not designated for hedge
accounting, all changes in fair value are reported in net income without considering the changes in the fair value of the economically associated assets or liabilities.

In
our commercial mortgage-backed securitization operation, we enter into commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans at specified interest rates and other applicable terms within
specified periods of time. These commitments are legally binding agreements to extend credit to a counterparty. Loan commitments that will be held for sale are recognized as derivatives and are
recorded at fair value.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing.

We formally document at inception all relationships
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes associating all derivatives
designated as fair value or cash flow hedges with specific assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position or with specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Effectiveness of
the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Even if a derivative is highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, the hedge might
have some ineffectiveness.

We
use qualitative and quantitative methods to assess hedge effectiveness. Qualitative methods may include monitoring changes to terms and conditions and counterparty credit ratings.
Quantitative methods may include statistical tests including regression analysis and minimum variance and dollar offset techniques. If we determine a derivative is no longer highly effective as a
hedge, we prospectively discontinue hedge accounting.

Termination of Hedge Accounting.

We prospectively discontinue hedge accounting when (1) the
criteria to qualify for hedge accounting is no longer met, e.g., a derivative is determined to no longer be highly effective in offsetting the change in fair value or cash flows of a hedged
item; (2) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated or exercised; or (3) we remove the designation of the derivative being the hedging instrument for a fair value or cash flow hedge.

If
it is determined that a derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried on the statement of financial position at its fair value, with
changes in fair value recognized currently in net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses). The asset or liability under a fair value hedge will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value
pursuant to hedging rules and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to the statement of operations line associated with the asset or liability. The component of other comprehensive income related
to discontinued cash flow hedges that are no longer highly effective is amortized to the statement of operations consistent with the net income impacts of the original hedged cash flows. If a cash
flow hedge is discontinued because a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the deferred gain or loss is immediately reclassified from other comprehensive income into net income.

Embedded Derivatives.

We purchase and issue financial instruments and products that contain a
derivative that is embedded in the financial instrument or product. We assess whether this embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the asset or liability that serves as its host
contract. If we deem that the embedded derivative's terms are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative
instrument, the derivative is bifurcated from that contract and held at fair value on the statement of financial position, with changes in fair value reported in net income.

Contractholder and Policyholder Liabilities

Contractholder and policyholder liabilities (contractholder funds, future policy benefits and claims and other policyholder funds) include reserves for investment
contracts and reserves for universal life, limited payment, participating, traditional and group life insurance, accident and health insurance and disability income policies, as well as a provision
for dividends on participating policies.

Investment
contracts are contractholders' funds on deposit with us and generally include reserves for pension and annuity contracts. Reserves on investment contracts are equal to the
cumulative deposits less any applicable charges and withdrawals plus credited interest. Reserves for universal life insurance contracts are equal to cumulative deposits less charges plus credited
interest, which represents the account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders.

We
hold additional reserves on certain long duration contracts where benefit features result in gains in early years followed by losses in later years, universal life/variable universal
life contracts that contain no lapse guarantee features, or annuities with guaranteed minimum death benefits.

Reserves
for nonparticipating term life insurance and disability income contracts are computed on a basis of assumed investment yield, mortality, morbidity and expenses, including a
provision for adverse deviation, which generally varies by plan, year of issue and policy duration. Investment yield is based on our experience. Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rate assumptions
are based on our experience and are periodically reviewed against both industry standards and experience.

Reserves
for participating life insurance contracts are based on the net level premium reserve for death and endowment policy benefits. This net level premium reserve is calculated based
on dividend fund interest rates and mortality rates guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in the contract.

Participating
business represented approximately 18%, 20% and 24% of our life insurance in force and 57%, 59% and 62% of the number of life insurance policies in force at
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Participating business represented approximately 53%, 56% and 58% of life insurance premiums for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The amount of dividends to policyholders is declared annually by Principal Life's Board of Directors. The amount of dividends to be paid to policyholders is determined after
consideration of several factors including interest, mortality, morbidity and other expense experience for the year and judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by
Principal Life. At the end of the reporting
period, Principal Life establishes a dividend liability for the pro rata portion of the dividends expected to be paid on or before the next policy anniversary date.

Some
of our policies and contracts require payment of fees in advance for services that will be rendered over the estimated lives of the policies and contracts. These payments are
established as unearned revenue reserves upon receipt and included in other policyholder funds in the consolidated statements of financial position. These unearned revenue reserves are amortized to
operations over the estimated lives of these policies and contracts in relation to the emergence of estimated gross profit margins.

The
liability for unpaid accident and health claims is an estimate of the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported losses not yet settled. This liability is estimated using actuarial
analyses and case basis evaluations. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, we believe that the liability for unpaid claims is adequate. These estimates are continually
reviewed and, as adjustments to this liability become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in net income.

Recognition of Premiums and Other Considerations, Fees and Other Revenues and Benefits

Traditional individual life insurance products include those products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits and consist principally of whole life and
term life insurance policies. Premiums from these products are recognized as premium revenue when due. Related policy benefits and expenses for individual life products are associated with earned
premiums and result in the recognition of profits over the expected term of the policies and contracts.

Immediate
annuities with life contingencies include products with fixed and guaranteed annuity considerations and benefits and consist principally of group and individual single premium
annuities with life contingencies. Annuity considerations from these products are recognized as revenue. However, the collection of these annuity considerations does not represent the completion of
the earnings process, as we establish annuity reserves, using estimates for mortality and investment assumptions, which include provision for adverse deviation as required by U.S. GAAP. We
anticipate profits to emerge over the life of the annuity products as we earn investment income, pay benefits and release reserves.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

Group
life and health insurance premiums are generally recorded as premium revenue over the term of the coverage. Certain group contracts contain experience premium refund provisions
based on a pre-defined formula that reflects their claim experience. Experience premium refunds are recognized as revenue over the term of the coverage and adjusted to reflect current
experience. Fees for contracts providing claim processing or other administrative services are recorded as revenue over the period the service is provided. Related policy benefits and expenses for
group life and health insurance products are associated with earned premiums and result in the recognition of profits over the term of the policies and contracts.

Universal
life-type policies are insurance contracts with terms that are not fixed. Amounts received as payments for such contracts are not reported as premium revenues.
Revenues for universal life-type insurance contracts consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy initiation and administration, surrender charges and other fees that have
been assessed against policy account values and investment income. Policy benefits
and claims that are charged to expense include interest credited to contracts and benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related policy account balances.

Investment
contracts do not subject us to significant risks arising from policyholder mortality or morbidity and consist primarily of Guaranteed Investment Contracts ("GICs"), funding
agreements and certain deferred annuities. Amounts received as payments for investment contracts are established as investment contract liability balances and are not reported as premium revenues.
Revenues for investment contracts consist of investment income and policy administration charges. Investment contract benefits that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period
in excess of related investment contract liability balances and interest credited to investment contract liability balances.

Fees
and other revenues are earned for asset management services provided to retail and institutional clients based largely upon contractual rates applied to the market value of the
client's portfolio. Additionally, fees and other revenues are earned for administrative services performed including recordkeeping and reporting services for retirement savings plans. Fees and other
revenues received for performance of asset management and administrative services are recognized as revenue when the service is performed or earned.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

Commissions and other costs (underwriting, issuance and field expenses) that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance
policies and investment contract business are capitalized to the extent recoverable. Maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to operations as incurred.

DPAC
for universal life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and investment contracts are being amortized over the lives of the policies and
contracts in relation to the emergence of estimated gross profit margins. For investment contracts pertaining to individual and group annuities which have separate account investment options, we
utilize a mean reversion method (reversion to the mean assumption), a common industry practice, to determine the future domestic equity market growth assumption used for the amortization of DPAC. This
amortization is adjusted in the current period when estimates of estimated gross profit are revised. The DPAC of nonparticipating term life insurance policies are being amortized over the
premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policyholder liabilities.

DPAC
are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event occurs that may warrant loss recognition. If loss
recognition is necessary, DPAC would be written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profits are not adequate to cover related losses and
expenses.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs on Internal Replacements

SOP 05-1 applies to all modifications and replacements made to contracts defined by SFAS No. 60,

Accounting and
Reporting by Insurance Enterprises

and SFAS No. 97,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration
Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments

. The SOP lists criteria that assist in defining an internal replacement transaction as involving a
substantially changed or substantially unchanged contract. We review all modifications and replacements that meet the definition of an internal replacement. If an internal replacement results in a
substantially changed contract, the acquisition costs, sales inducements and unearned revenue associated with the new contract are deferred and amortized over the lifetime of
the new contract. In addition, the existing DPAC, sales inducement, and unearned revenue balances associated with the replaced contract are written off.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

If
an internal replacement results in a substantially unchanged contract, the acquisition costs, sales inducements and unearned revenue associated with the new contract are not deferred.
All acquisition costs, sales inducements and unearned revenue associated with the new contract are immediately recognized in the period incurred. In addition, the existing DPAC, sales inducement, or
unearned revenue balance associated with the replaced contract is not written off, but instead is carried over to the new contract.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt includes notes payable, nonrecourse mortgages and other debt with a maturity date greater than one year at the date of issuance.
Current maturities of long term debt are classified as long-term debt in our statement of financial position.

Reinsurance

We enter into reinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal course of business. We may assume reinsurance from or cede reinsurance to other companies.
Assets and liabilities related to reinsurance ceded are reported on a gross basis. Premiums and expenses are reported net of reinsurance ceded. We are contingently liable with respect to reinsurance
ceded to other companies in the event the reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations it has assumed. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, we had reinsured $19.9 billion,
$21.7 billion and $21.2 billion of life insurance in force, representing 11%, 13%, and 14%, respectively, of total net life insurance in force through a single third-party reinsurer. To
minimize the possibility of losses, we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk.

The
effects of reinsurance on premiums and other considerations and policy and contract benefits were as follows:

Separate Accounts

The separate account assets presented in the consolidated financial statements represent the fair market value of funds that are separately administered by us for
contracts with equity, real estate and fixed income investments. The separate account contract owner, rather than us, bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account assets are legally
segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any of our other business. We receive fees for mortality, withdrawal, and expense risks, as well as administrative, maintenance and
investment advisory services, that are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Net deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate
accounts are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the separate accounts include a separate account valued at $748.5 million and $768.4 million, respectively, which primarily includes
shares of our stock that were allocated and issued to eligible participants of qualified employee benefit plans administered by us as part of the policy credits issued under our 2001 demutualization.
These shares are included in both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. The separate account shares are recorded at fair value and are reported as separate account assets in the
consolidated statements of financial position. Separate account liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position are reported at the fair value of the underlying assets. Changes in
fair value of the separate account shares are reflected in both the separate account assets and separate account liabilities and do not impact our results of operations.

Income Taxes

We file a U.S. consolidated income tax return that includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries. Our policy of allocating income tax expenses and benefits
to companies in the group is generally based upon pro rata contribution of taxable income or operating losses. We are taxed at corporate rates on taxable income based on existing tax laws. Current
income taxes are charged or credited to net income based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred income taxes are provided
for the tax effect of temporary differences in the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating losses using enacted income tax rates and laws. The effect on
deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period in which the change is enacted.

Foreign Exchange

Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates denominated in non-U.S. dollars, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional
currency, are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of stockholders' equity,
along with any related hedge and tax effects. Revenues and expenses for these entities are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. Revenue, expense and other foreign currency
transaction and translation adjustments with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency that affect cash flows are reported in net income, along with related hedge and tax effects.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Goodwill and other intangibles include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets recorded in connection with
acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at one level below our operating
segments on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing for indefinite-lived
intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.

Intangible
assets with a finite useful life are amortized as related benefits emerge over a period of 3 to 30 years and are reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment in
value. If facts and circumstances suggest possible impairment, the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is compared to the current carrying
value of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of assets over their fair value.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for
the period and excludes the dilutive effect of equity awards. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities, such as options and
non-vested stock grants, were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.

Reclassifications

Reclassifications have been made to the 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2007 presentation.

2. Acquisition

On December 31, 2006, we completed the purchase of WM Advisors, Inc., a leading mutual fund manager, for a total cost of $741.1 million in

capability and increasing our presence with independent financial advisors.

the acquired intangibles are subject to amortization and consist of: $86.9 million of customer-based intangibles (eight-year useful life); $51.0 million of asset management
contracts (three-year useful life); $5.0 million ascribed to the distribution channel (18-year useful life); and $1.0 million ascribed to non-compete
agreements (one-year useful life).

Consistent
with the acquired intangibles, $52.1 million of goodwill was assigned to our U.S. Asset Accumulation segment and $10.6 million to our Global Asset Management
segment. The goodwill amounts are deductible for tax purposes.

Real Estate Investments

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we sold certain real estate properties previously held for investment purposes. These properties qualify for discontinued operations
treatment. Therefore, the income from discontinued operations has been removed from our results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The gains on disposal, which are reported in our
Corporate and Other segment, are excluded from segment operating earnings for all periods presented. All assets, including cash, and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been reclassified

Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc.

On July 1, 2004, we closed the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. to CitiMortgage, Inc. Our total after-tax proceeds
from the sale were approximately $620.0 million.

The
decision to sell Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. was made with a view toward intensifying our strategic focus on our core retirement and risk protection business as well
as achieving our longer-term financial objectives. In addition, the sale was also viewed as a positive move for our stockholders as it enabled us to move forward from an improved capital
position, with better financial flexibility and greater stability of earnings.

During
2005, certain true-up adjustments were made related to the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. resulting in a $5.0 million after-tax
loss, which is reflected as discontinued operations. We have separately disclosed the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations in our
consolidated statements of cash flows.

BT Financial Group

On October 31, 2002, we sold substantially all of BT Financial Group to Westpac Banking Corporation ("Westpac"). Our total after-tax proceeds
from the sale were approximately U.S. $900.0 million. This amount includes cash proceeds from Westpac, tax benefits and a gain from unwinding the hedged asset associated with our investment in
BT Financial Group.

3. Discontinued Operations — (continued)

The
decision to sell BT Financial Group was made with a view toward focusing our resources, executing on core strategic priorities and meeting stockholder expectations. Changing market
dynamics since our acquisition of BT Financial Group, including industry consolidation, led us to conclude that the interests of BT Financial Group clients and staff would be best served under
Westpac's ownership.

Changes
to the loss on discontinued operations due to the close of a tax audit resulted in an increase to net income of $8.4 million in 2005. We have separately disclosed the
operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Present
value of future profits ("PVFP") represents the present value of estimated future profits to be generated from existing insurance contracts in-force at the date of
acquisition and is amortized over the expected policy or contract duration in relation to estimated gross profits. Interest rates used to calculate the estimated interest accruals were 9.00% for all
years related to PVFP generated from Mexico acquisitions and 6.36% in 2007, 6.43% declining to 6.36% in 2006, and 6.51% declining to 6.43% in 2005, related to PVFP generated from Chile acquisitions.

5. Variable Interest Entities

We have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and other entities where we have a variable interest. The following serves as a discussion of
investments in entities that meet the definition of a VIE.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation.

On May 26, 2005, we invested $130.0 million
in a secured limited recourse credit linked note issued by a grantor trust. The trust entered into a credit default swap providing credit protection on the first 45% of loss of seven mezzanine
tranches totaling $288.9 million of seven synthetic reference portfolios. Our risk of loss for the seven referenced mezzanine tranches begins at 4.85% and ends at 10.85% of loss on each of the
seven synthetic reference portfolios. Therefore, defaults in an underlying reference portfolio will only affect the credit-linked note if cumulative losses exceed 4.85% of a synthetic reference
portfolio.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

5. Variable Interest Entities — (continued)

We
have determined that this grantor trust is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary of the trust due to our interest in the VIE and management of the synthetic reference
portfolios. Upon consolidation of the trust, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our consolidated statements of financial position include $127.2 million and $130.3 million,
respectively, of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, which represent the collateral held by the trust. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the credit default
swap entered into by the trust has an outstanding notional amount of $130.0 million. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the credit default swaps had a change in
fair value that resulted in a $3.2 million pre-tax loss, a $4.4 million pre-tax gain and $0.4 million pre-tax loss, respectively. The creditors
of the grantor trusts have no recourse to our assets.

Grantor Trusts.

We contributed undated subordinated floating rate notes to three grantor trusts. The
trusts separated the cash flows of the underlying notes by issuing an interest-only certificate and a residual certificate related to each note contributed. Each interest-only
certificate entitles the holder to interest on the stated note for a specified term while the residual certificate entitles the holder to interest payments subsequent to the term of the
interest-only certificate and to all principal payments. We retained the interest-only certificate and the residual certificates were subsequently sold to a third party.

We
have determined that these grantor trusts are VIEs as our interest-only certificates are exposed to the majority of the risk of loss. The restricted interest periods end
between 2016 and 2020 and, at that time, the residual certificate holders' certificates are redeemed by the trust in return for the notes. We have determined that it will be necessary for us to
consolidate these entities until the expiration of the interest-only period. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our consolidated statements of financial position include
$332.1 million and $366.2 million, respectively, of undated subordinated floating rate notes of the grantor trusts, which are classified as available-for-sale
fixed maturity securities and represent the collateral held by the trust. The obligation to deliver the underlying securities to the residual certificate holders of $155.6 million and
$156.8 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is classified as an other liability and contains an embedded derivative of the forecasted transaction to deliver the
underlying securities. The creditors of the grantor trusts have no recourse to our assets.

Other.

In addition to the entities above, we have a number of relationships with a disparate group of
entities, which meet the criteria for VIEs. Due to the nature of our direct investment in the equity and/or debt of these VIEs, we are the primary beneficiary of such entities, which requires us to
consolidate them. These entities include seven private investment vehicles, a financial services company and a hedge fund. The consolidation of these VIEs did not have a material effect on either our
consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2007 or 2006, or results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. For the majority of these
entities, the creditors have no recourse to our assets.

The
carrying amount and classification of consolidated VIE assets that are collateral the VIEs have designated for their other obligations and the debt of the VIEs are as follows:

debt. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, these entities had long-term debt of $175.6 million and $206.4 million, respectively, all of which was issued to our affiliates
and, therefore, eliminated upon consolidation.

5. Variable Interest Entities — (continued)

Significant Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

We hold a significant variable interest in a number of VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. These entities include private investment vehicles and
custodial relationships that have issued trust certificates or custodial receipts that are recorded as available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in the consolidated
financial statements.

On
June 14, 2007, we invested $100.0 million in a secured limited recourse note issued by a private investment vehicle. The note represents Class B-1
notes. Class A notes are senior and Class C through Class E notes are subordinated to Class B notes. The entity entered into a credit default swap with a third party
providing credit protection in exchange for a fee. Defaults in an underlying reference portfolio will only affect the note if cumulative
losses of a synthetic reference portfolio exceed the loss attachment point on the portfolio. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary, as we do not hold the majority of the risk of loss.
Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this entity is our recorded investment of $84.2 million as of December 31, 2007.

On
June 21, 2006, we invested $285.0 million in a secured limited recourse note issued by a private investment vehicle. The note represents Class B notes.
Class A notes are senior and Class C through Class F notes are subordinated to Class B notes. The entity entered into a credit default swap with a third party providing
credit protection in exchange for a fee. Defaults in an underlying reference portfolio will only affect the note if cumulative losses of a synthetic reference portfolio exceed the loss attachment
point on the portfolio. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary, as we do not hold the majority of the risk of loss. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this
entity is our recorded investment of $223.2 million and $285.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

On
September 21, 2001, we entered into a transaction where a third party transferred funds to a trust. The trust purchased shares of a specific money market fund and then
separated the cash flows of the money market shares into share receipts and dividend receipts. The dividend receipts entitle the holder to dividends paid for a specified term while the share receipts,
purchased at a discount, entitle the holder to dividend payments subsequent to the term of the dividend receipts and the rights to the underlying shares. We have purchased the share receipts. After
the restricted dividend period ends on December 21, 2021, we, as the share receipt holder, have the right to terminate the trust agreement and will receive the underlying money market fund
shares. We determined the primary beneficiary is the dividend receipt holder, which has the majority of the risk of loss. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these
entities is our recorded investment of $66.1 million and $65.9 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

On
June 20, 1997, we entered into a transaction in which we purchased a residual trust certificate. The trust separated the cash flows of an underlying security into an
interest-only certificate that entitles the third party certificate holder to the stated interest on the underlying security through May 15, 2017, and into a residual certificate
entitling the holder to interest payments subsequent to the term of the interest-only certificates and any principal payments. Subsequent to the restricted interest period, we, as the
residual certificate holder, have the right to terminate the trust agreement and will receive the underlying security. We determined the primary beneficiary is the interest-only
certificate holder, which has the majority of the risk of loss. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this entity is our recorded investment of $83.4 million and
$78.7 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Proceeds
from sales of investments (excluding call and maturity proceeds) in fixed maturities were $2.4 billion, $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion in 2007, 2006, and
2005, respectively.

We
recognize impairment losses for fixed maturities and equity securities when declines in value are other than temporary. Gross realized losses related to other than temporary
impairments of fixed maturity securities were $215.7 million, $14.6 million and $28.6 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Certain fixed maturity securities moved into a
loss position during the second quarter of 2007, and we determined that we did not have the ability and intent to hold these securities. As a result, we also recognized impairment losses on these
securities of $24.5 million, net of recoveries on the subsequent sale, primarily due to a change in interest rates. As a result of the need to fund our acquisition of
WM Advisors, Inc. we also recognized $17.2 million of write-downs in 2006 that resulted from our determination that we no longer had the ability and intent to hold certain fixed
maturity securities until they recovered in value. We also recognized gross realized losses as the result of credit triggered sales of $32.3 million, $22.2 million and
$30.8 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In 2005, we also recognized an $11.0 million loss related to a large

As
of December 31, 2007, we held $19,990.4 million in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses of
$1,187.6 million. Of these amounts, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio represented $19,574.5 million in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with
unrealized losses of $1,168.2 million. Principal Life's consolidated portfolio consists of fixed maturity securities where 95% are investment grade (rated AAA through BBB-) with an
average price of 94 (carrying value/amortized cost). Due to the credit disruption in the last half of 2007 that led to reduced liquidity and wider credit spreads, we saw an increase in unrealized
losses in our securities portfolio. The unrealized losses were more pronounced in structured products such as collateralized debt obligations and asset-backed securities.

For
those securities that have been in a loss position for less than twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio holds 1,268 securities with a carrying value of
$11,897.8 million and unrealized losses of $785.5 million reflecting an average price of 94. Of this portfolio, 93% was investment grade (rated AAA through BBB-) at
December 31, 2007, with associated unrealized losses of $738.0 million. The losses on these securities can primarily be attributed to changes in market interest rates and changes in
credit spreads since the securities were acquired.

For
those securities that have been in a continuous loss position greater than or equal to twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio holds 945 securities with a carrying
value of $7,676.7 million and unrealized losses of $382.7 million. The average rating of this portfolio is A with an average price of 95 at December 31, 2007. Of the
$382.7 million in unrealized losses, the Corporate-public and Corporate-private sectors account for $283.8 million in unrealized losses with an average price of 95 and an average credit
rating of BBB+. The remaining unrealized losses consist primarily of $95.6 million in unrealized losses within the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities sector. The average price of
the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities sector is 96 and the average credit

Commercial Mortgage Loan Loss Allowance

Mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we
determine that a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value. Estimated value is based on
either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or fair value of the collateral. The change in the
valuation allowance is included in net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated statements of operations.

The
allowance for losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Management's periodic evaluation and assessment of the
adequacy of the allowance for losses and the need for mortgage impairments is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the
estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. The evaluation of our loan specific reserve component is
subjective, as it requires the estimation and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Impaired mortgage loans, along with the related allowance for losses, were as

Other Investments

Other investments include minority interests in unconsolidated entities, domestic and international joint ventures and partnerships and properties owned jointly
with venture partners and operated by the partners. Such investments are generally accounted for using the equity method. In applying the equity method, we record our share of income or loss reported
by the equity investees. Changes in the value of our investment in equity investees attributable to capital transactions of the investee, such as an additional offering of stock, are recorded directly
to stockholders' equity. Total assets of the unconsolidated entities were $17,290.8 million and $12,010.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total revenues of
the unconsolidated entities were $3,382.1 million, $2,174.1 million and $1,785.6 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we included
$106.1 million, $94.3 million and $89.3 million, respectively, in net investment income representing our share of current year net income of the unconsolidated entities. At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, our net investment in unconsolidated entities was $604.9 million and $387.0 million, respectively.

In
the ordinary course of our business and as part of our investment operations, we have also entered into long term contracts to make and purchase investments aggregating
$402.2 million and $677.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Derivative
assets are carried at fair value and reported as a component of other investments. Certain seed money investments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included
in net income as net realized/unrealized capital gains or losses.

7. Securitization Transactions

We, along with other contributors, sell commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions to trusts. As these trusts are classified as a QSPE, they are not
subject to the VIE consolidation rules. We purchase primary servicing
responsibilities and may retain other interests. The investors and the securitization entities have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The value of our retained
interests is subject primarily to credit risk. In 2006, we began transitioning our securitization platform to a new joint venture company that we report using the equity method of accounting. The
transition was complete by the end of 2007 such that all of our commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions going forward are expected to be conducted through the joint venture.

In
2007, 2006, and 2005, we recognized gains of $2.2 million, $13.6 million and $39.8 million, respectively, on the securitization of commercial mortgage loans.

Key
economic assumptions used in measuring the other retained interests at the date of securitization resulting from transactions completed included a cumulative foreclosure rate between
1% and 7% during 2007, 2% and 10% during 2006, and 5% and 18% during 2005. The assumed range of the loss severity, as a percentage of defaulted loans, was between 1% and 27% during 2007, 2% and 31%
during 2006, and 3% and 29% during 2005. The low end of the loss severity range relates to a portfolio of seasoned loans. The high end of the loss severity range relates to a portfolio of newly issued
loans.

At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair values of other retained interests related to the securitizations of commercial mortgage loans were $315.8 million and
$345.3 million, respectively. Only $0.3 million in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2006 represented equity investments. All other interests are classified as
available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, $131.7 million and $156.2 million of these
available-for-sale securities were interest-only investments. Cash flows are continuously monitored for adverse deviations from original expectations and
impairments are recorded when necessary.

8. Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are generally used to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks (primarily interest rate and foreign currency risks) associated with assets held or
expected to be purchased or sold and liabilities incurred or expected to be incurred. Derivatives are used to change the characteristics of our asset/liability mix consistent with our risk management
activities. Additionally, derivatives are also used in asset replication strategies. We do not buy, sell or hold these investments for trading purposes.

Types of Derivative Instruments

Interest rate swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate
interest amounts based upon designated market rates or rate indices and an agreed upon notional principal amount. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal
payments are made by either party. Cash is paid or received based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to
be made by one counterparty at each due date. We use interest rate swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities arising from timing mismatches
between assets and liabilities (including duration mismatches). We also use interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the value of assets we anticipate acquiring and other anticipated
transactions and commitments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against changes in the value of the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB") liability. The GMWB rider on our variable annuity
products provides for guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits regardless of the actual performance of various equity and/or fixed income funds available with the product.

In
exchange-traded futures transactions, we agree to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values of which are determined by the values of designated classes of
securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. We enter into exchange-traded futures with regulated
futures commissions merchants who are members of a trading exchange. We have used exchange-traded futures to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates, to alter mismatches between the assets
in a portfolio and the liabilities supported by those assets, and to hedge against changes in the value of securities we own or anticipate acquiring or selling. We use exchange-traded futures to hedge
against changes in the value of the GMWB liability related to the GMWB rider on our variable annuity product, as previously explained.

A
swaption is an option to enter into an interest rate swap at a future date. We write these options and receive a premium in order to transform our callable liabilities into fixed term
liabilities. In addition, we may sell an investment-type contract with attributes tied to market indices (an embedded derivative as noted below), in which case we write an equity call
option to convert the overall contract into a fixed-rate liability, essentially eliminating the equity component altogether. Equity call spreads are purchased to fund the equity
participation rates promised to contractholders in conjunction with our fixed deferred annuity products that credit interest based on changes in an external equity index. Equity put options are used
to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB liability related to the GMWB rider on our variable annuity products, as previously explained.

Currency
forwards are contracts in which we agree with other parties to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. Typically, the price is agreed
upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. Currency swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between one currency and another at a forward exchange rate as calculated by reference to an agreed principal amount. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is
exchanged at the beginning and termination of the currency swap by each party. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one
counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date. We use currency forwards and currency swaps to reduce market risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect to
investments or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that we either hold or intend to acquire or sell. We have also used currency forwards to hedge the currency risk associated with net
investments in foreign operations and anticipated earnings of our foreign operations.

We
use credit default swaps to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by providing comparable exposure to fixed income securities that might not be available in the primary
market. They are also occasionally used to hedge credit exposures in our investment portfolio. Credit derivatives are used to sell or buy credit protection on an identified name or names on an
unfunded or synthetic basis in return for receiving or paying a quarterly premium. At the same time we enter into these synthetic transactions, we buy a quality cash bond to match against the credit
default swap. The premium generally corresponds to a referenced name's credit spread at the time the agreement is executed. When selling protection, if there is an event of default by the referenced
name, as defined by the agreement, we are obligated to pay

the
counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security in an amount equal to the notional value of the credit default swap.

In
our commercial mortgage backed securitization operation, we enter into commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans at specified interest rates and other applicable terms within
specified periods of time. These commitments are legally binding agreements to extend credit to a counterparty. Loan commitments that will be held for sale are recognized as interest rate lock
commitment derivatives that are recorded at fair value. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected total cash flows using market rates that are applicable to the yield, credit quality and
maturity of each commitment. Loan commitments that are related to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for investment are not accounted for as derivatives and, accordingly, are not
recognized in our financial statements.

A
treasury lock is an agreement that allows the holder to lock in a benchmark interest rate. If the benchmark interest rate increases, the holder is entitled to receive a payment from
the counterparty to the agreement equal to the present value of the difference in the benchmark interest rate and the locked-in benchmark interest rate. If the benchmark interest rate
decreases, the holder must pay the counterparty to the agreement an amount equal to the present value of the difference in the benchmark interest rate and the locked-in benchmark interest
rate. We use treasury lock agreements to hedge against changes in the value of anticipated transactions and commitments.

Commodity
swaps are used to sell or buy protection on commodity prices in return for receiving or paying a quarterly premium. We purchased AAA rated secured limited recourse notes from
VIEs that are consolidated in our financial results. These VIEs use a commodity swap to enhance the return on an investment portfolio by selling protection on a static portfolio of commodity trigger
swaps, each referencing a base or precious metal. The portfolio of commodity trigger swaps is a portfolio of deep out-of-the-money European puts on various base or
precious metals. The VIEs provide mezzanine protection that the average spot rate will not fall below a certain trigger price on each commodity trigger swap in the portfolio and receives guaranteed
quarterly premiums in return until maturity. At the same time the VIEs enter into this synthetic transaction, they buy a quality cash bond to match against the commodity swaps.

Exposure

Our risk of loss is typically limited to the fair value of our derivative instruments and not to the notional or contractual amounts of these derivatives. Risk
arises from changes in the fair value of the underlying instruments. We are also exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance of the counterparties. Our current credit exposure is limited
to the value of derivatives that have become favorable to us. This credit risk is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with high credit ratings and by establishing and
monitoring exposure limits. We also utilize various credit enhancements, including collateral and credit triggers to reduce the credit exposure to our derivative instruments.

Our
derivative transactions are generally documented under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements
provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a
transaction, we are permitted to set off our receivable from a counterparty against our payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions.

Prior
to the application of the aforementioned credit enhancements, the gross exposure to credit risk with respect to these derivative instruments was $1,168.0 million and
$752.4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk was $841.5 million and
$554.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We use fixed-to-floating rate interest rate swaps to more closely align the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and
liabilities. In general, these swaps are used in asset and liability management to modify duration.

We
enter into currency exchange swap agreements to convert certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollar floating-rate denominated instruments to
eliminate the exposure to future currency volatility on those items.

We
have used interest rates swaps to hedge interest rate and spread risk in our commercial mortgage securitization operations.

We
also sell callable investment-type agreements and use cancellable interest rate swaps and written interest rate swaptions to hedge the changes in fair value of the
callable feature.

The
net interest effect of interest rate swap and currency swap transactions for derivatives in fair value hedges is recorded as an adjustment to income or expense of the underlying
hedged item in our consolidated statements of operations.

We
recognized a pre-tax net gain (loss) of $(7.9) million, $4.7 million and $(11.8) million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, relating to the ineffective portion
of our fair value hedges, which was reported with net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses) in our consolidated statements of operations. All gains or losses on derivatives were included in the
assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Cash Flow Hedges

We utilize floating-to-fixed rate interest rate swaps to eliminate the variability in cash flows of recognized financial assets and
liabilities and forecasted transactions. We also utilize treasury lock agreements to eliminate the variability in cash flows of forecasted transactions.

We
enter into currency exchange swap agreements to convert both principal and interest payments of certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollar denominated
fixed-rate instruments to eliminate the exposure to future currency volatility on those items.

The
net interest effect of interest rate swap and currency swap transactions for derivatives in cash flow hedges is recorded as an adjustment to income or expense of the underlying
hedged item in our consolidated statements of operations.

In
2007, 2006, and 2005, we recognized a $(16.7) million, $4.4 million and $27.0 million after-tax increase (decrease) in value, respectively, related to cash
flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income. During this time period, none of our cash flow hedges have been discontinued because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction
would not occur by the end of the originally specified time period. We reclassified $3.6 million, $0.7 million, and $21.3 million in net losses from accumulated comprehensive
income into net income during 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively, which are the portion of deferred losses related to the variability in cash flows that were hedged and impacted net income in those
periods. We expect to reclassify net losses of $4.1 million in the next 12 months.

For
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $2.0 million, $2.5 million, and $1.2 million in net income
due to cash flow hedge ineffectiveness, respectively. All gains or losses on derivatives were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

The
maximum length of time that we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions, excluding those related to the payments of variable
interest on existing financial assets and liabilities, is 12.5 years.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations Hedges

From time to time, we may take measures to hedge our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries from currency risks. We did not use any currency forwards during
2007 or 2006 and did not have any currency forwards outstanding at December 31, 2007, to hedge our net investment in foreign operations.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

Our use of futures, certain swaptions and swaps, options, currency forwards, and interest rate lock commitments are effective from an economic standpoint, but
they have not been designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. As such, periodic changes in the market value of these instruments, which includes unrealized gains and losses as well as
periodic and final settlements, flow directly into net income. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, gains (losses) of $(70.6) million, $10.4 million and $(15.7) million,
respectively, were recognized in net income from market value changes of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment, including market value changes of embedded derivatives that have been
bifurcated from the host contract.

8. Derivative Financial Instruments — (continued)

Embedded Derivatives

We may purchase or issue financial instruments or products that contain a derivative instrument that is embedded in the financial instrument or product. When it
is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic
characteristics that are not clearly or closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the
embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the consolidated statements of financial position, is
carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income.

We
sell investment-type liability contracts in which the return is tied to an external equity index, a leveraged inflation index or leveraged reference swap. These returns
are embedded options that are bifurcated from the host investment-type contract and accounted for separately. We economically hedge the embedded equity derivative by writing equity call
options with identical features to convert the overall contract into a fixed-rate liability, effectively eliminating the equity component altogether. For the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, we recognized a $0.1 million, $3.1 million and $1.0 million pre-tax gain on the purchased equity call options
and a $0.1 million, $3.1 million and $1.0 million pre-tax loss on the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. We economically hedge the leveraged embedded
derivatives with interest rate swaps and currency swaps to convert them to a fixed-rate liability or floating rate U.S. dollar liability. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively, we recognized a $4.6 million pre-tax gain and a $2.6 million pre-tax loss on the swaps and a $4.6 million pre-tax loss and
a $6.0 million pre-tax gain on the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives.

We
offer a guaranteed fund as an investment option in our defined contribution plans in Hong Kong. This fund contains an embedded option that has been bifurcated and accounted for
separately, with changes in fair value reported in net realized/unrealized gains (losses). There was no pre-tax gain or loss recognized for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, because the fair value of the guarantees has been less than the fair value of the benefits.

We
contributed undated subordinated floating rate notes to three grantor trusts. The trusts separated the cash flows of the underlying notes by issuing an interest-only
certificate and a residual certificate related to each note contributed. We retained the interest-only certificates and the residual certificates were subsequently sold to a third party.
We have determined these grantor trusts are VIEs and it is necessary for us to consolidate these entities. The obligation to deliver the underlying securities to residual certificate holders of
$155.6 million, $156.8 million, and $147.4 million as of December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively is classified as an other liability and contains an embedded
derivative of the forecasted transaction to deliver the underlying securities. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, we recognized a $19.6 million,
$7.2 million and $2.7 million pre-tax gain on the change in fair value of the obligation, which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated
statements of financial position.

During
2005, we purchased existing Class A units of a trust that represent interest payments on the underlying security within the trust. The trust also issued Class B
units representing the residual interests in the underlying security. We have determined that this trust is a VIE and it is necessary for us to consolidate this entity. The obligation to deliver the
underlying security to the Class B unit holder of $10.6 million, $12.0 million and $10.5 million as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is classified
as an other liability and contains an embedded derivative of the forecasted transaction to deliver the underlying security. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
we recognized a $2.3 million, $(0.5) million and $(0.4) million pre-tax gain (loss) on the change in fair value of the obligation, which is reflected in accumulated other
comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position.

We
offer a fixed deferred annuity product that credits interest based on changes in an external equity index. It contains an embedded derivative that has been bifurcated and accounted
for separately, with changes in fair value reported in net realized/unrealized gains (losses). We economically hedge the fixed deferred annuity product by purchasing options that match the product's
profile. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, we recognized a $1.2 million, $5.3 million and $1.5 million pre-tax gain on the
call spread options purchased and a $2.7 million, $6.1 million and $2.3 million pre-tax loss on the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives.

We
offer certain variable annuity products with a GMWB rider. The GMWB provides that the contractholder will receive at least their principal deposit back through withdrawals of up to a
specified annual amount, even if the account value is reduced to zero. The GMWB represents an embedded derivative in the variable annuity contract that is required to be reported separately from the
host variable annuity contract. Declines in the equity market may increase our exposure to benefits under contracts with the GMWB. We economically hedge the GMWB exposure using futures, options and
interest rate swaps. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, we recognized in

$19.7 million pre-tax loss, $2.8 million pre-tax gain and $0.2 million pre-tax loss on the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives,
respectively.

9. Closed Block

In connection with the 1998 MIHC formation, Principal Life formed a Closed Block to provide reasonable assurance to policyholders included therein that, after the
formation of the MIHC, assets would be available to maintain dividends in aggregate in accordance with the 1997 policy dividend scales, if the experience underlying such scales continued. Assets of
Principal Life were allocated to the Closed Block in an amount that produces cash flows which, together with anticipated revenue from policies and contracts included in the Closed Block, were expected
to be sufficient to support the Closed Block policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for payment of claims, certain expenses, charges and taxes, and to provide for continuation of policy
and contract dividends in aggregate in accordance with the 1997 dividend scales, if the experience underlying such scales continues, and to allow for appropriate adjustments in such scales, if such
experience changes. Due to adjustable life policies being included in the Closed Block, the Closed Block is charged with amounts necessary to properly fund for certain adjustments, such as face amount
and premium increases, that are made to these policies after the Closed Block inception date. These amounts are referred to as Funding Adjustment Charges and are treated as capital transfers from the
Closed Block.

Assets
allocated to the Closed Block inure solely to the benefit of the holders of policies included in the Closed Block. Closed Block assets and liabilities are carried on the same
basis as other similar assets and liabilities. Principal Life will continue to pay guaranteed benefits under all policies, including the policies within the Closed Block, in accordance with their
terms. If the assets allocated to the Closed Block, the investment cash flows from those assets and the revenues from the policies included in the Closed Block, including investment income thereon,
prove to be insufficient to pay the benefits guaranteed under the policies included in the Closed Block, Principal Life will be required to make such payments from their general funds. No additional
policies were added to the Closed Block, nor was the Closed Block affected in any other way, as a result of the demutualization.

A
PDO is required to be established for earnings in the Closed Block that are not available to stockholders. A model of the Closed Block was established to produce the pattern of
expected earnings in the Closed Block (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income).

If
actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the Closed Block, only the expected cumulative earnings will be recognized in
income with the excess recorded as a PDO. This PDO represents undistributed accumulated earnings that will be paid to Closed Block policyholders as additional policyholder dividends unless offset by
future performance of the Closed Block that is less favorable than originally expected. If actual cumulative performance is less favorable than expected, only actual earnings will be recognized in
income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, cumulative actual earnings have been less than cumulative expected earnings. Additionally, cumulative net unrealized gains did not exceed the cumulative
earnings experience. Therefore, there was no PDO liability as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Our
GICs and funding agreements contain provisions limiting early surrenders, which typically include penalties for early surrenders, minimum notice requirements or, in the case of
funding agreements with survivor options, minimum pre-death holding periods and specific maximum amounts.

Funding
agreements include those issued directly to nonqualified institutional investors, as well as to three separate programs where the funding agreements have been issued directly or
indirectly to unconsolidated special purpose entities. Claims for principal and interest under funding agreements are afforded equal priority to claims of life insurance and annuity policyholders
under insolvency provisions of Iowa Insurance Laws.

We
are authorized to issue up to $4.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in 1998 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an unaffiliated
entity in non-U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $3,935.3 million and $3,770.4 million, respectively, of liabilities are outstanding with respect to the
issuance outstanding under this program. We do not anticipate any new issuance activity under this program as we are authorized to issue up to Euro 4.0 billion (approximately
USD$5.3 billion) of funding agreements under a program established in 2006 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an unaffiliated entity in non-U.S. markets.
The unaffiliated entity is an unconsolidated special purpose vehicle. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $1,469.8 million and $474.1 million, respectively, of liabilities are
outstanding with respect to the issuance outstanding under this new program.

In
addition, we were authorized to issue up to $7.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in 2001 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by
an unaffiliated entity in both domestic and international markets. The unaffiliated entity is an unconsolidated qualifying special purpose entity. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
$3,109.9 million and $3,747.9 million, respectively, of liabilities are being held with respect to the issuance outstanding under this program. We do not anticipate any new issuance
activity under this program, given our December 2005 termination of the dealership agreement for this program and the availability of the SEC-registered program described in the following
paragraph.

We
were authorized to issue up to $4.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in March 2004 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by
unaffiliated entities in both domestic and international markets. In February 2006, this program was amended to authorize issuance of up to an additional $5.0 billion in recognition of the use
of nearly all $4.0 billion of initial issuance authorization. In recognition of the use of nearly all $9.0 billion, this program was amended in November 2007 to authorize issuance of up
to an additional $5.0 billion. Under this program, both the notes and the supporting funding agreements are registered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
$6,748.5 million and $5,831.4 million, respectively, of liabilities are being held with respect to the issuance outstanding under this program. In contrast with direct funding
agreements, GIC issuances and the other two funding agreement-backed medium term note programs described above, Principal Life's payment obligations on each funding agreement issued under this
SEC-registered program are guaranteed by Principal Financial Group, Inc.

part from developed claims for prior years being different than were anticipated when the liabilities for unpaid
accident and health claims were originally estimated. These trends have been considered in establishing the current year liability for unpaid accident and health claims. We also had claim adjustment
expense liabilities of $37.0 million, $33.4 million and $30.6 million, and related reinsurance recoverables of $4.2 million, $4.9 million and $3.5 million in

On
October 16 and December 5, 2006, we issued $500.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of senior notes from our shelf registration, which became
effective on June 30, 2004. The notes bear interest at a rate of 6.05% per year. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 each year
and began on April 15, 2007. The notes will mature on October 15, 2036. A portion of the proceeds was used to fund the acquisition of WM Advisors, Inc., with the remaining
proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.

On
November 3, 2005, Principal International de Chile S.A., a wholly owned indirect subsidiary, entered into long-term borrowing agreements with two Chilean
banks in the amount of US $93.9 million. This debt is denominated in Unidades de Formento ("UF"), a Chilean inflation-indexed, peso-denominated monetary unit. Of this amount, US
$49.0 million of UF +3.31% notes, which was refinanced from +4.59% during 2007, and US $44.9 million of UF +3.63% notes, which was refinanced from +4.93% in 2007, mature on
November 3, 2011. In November 2007, we paid down US $17.7 million on the UF +3.63% notes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 3 and November 3
each year. The debt outstanding and interest expense will vary due to fluctuations in the Chilean peso to US dollar exchange rates and Chilean inflation.

On
August 25, 1999, Principal Financial Group (Australia) Holdings Pty. Limited, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary, issued $665.0 million of unsecured redeemable
long-term debt. Of this amount, $200.0 million of 7.95% notes matured on August 15, 2004, with the remaining $465.0 million in 8.2% notes due August 15, 2009.
In August 2007, we repurchased $10.0 million of the remaining notes, leaving $455.0 million in 8.2% notes due on August 15, 2009. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on
February 15 and August 15 of each year. Principal Financial Group (Australia) Holdings Pty. Limited used the net proceeds from the notes to partially fund the purchase of the outstanding
stock of several companies affiliated with Bankers Trust Australia Group. On December 28, 2001, all of the long-term debt obligations of Principal Financial Group (Australia)
Holdings Pty. Limited were assumed by its parent, Principal Financial Services, Inc.

March 10, 1994, Principal Life issued $100.0 million of surplus notes due March 1, 2044, at an 8% annual interest rate. None of our affiliates hold any portion of
the notes. Each payment of interest and principal on the notes, however, may be made only with the prior approval of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa (the "Commissioner") and only to
the extent that Principal Life has sufficient surplus earnings to make such payments. Interest of $8.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approved
by the Commissioner, and charged to expense.

Subject
to Commissioner approval, the notes due March 1, 2044, may be redeemed at Principal Life's election on or after March 1, 2014, in whole or in part at a redemption
price of approximately 102.3% of par. The approximate 2.3% premium is scheduled to gradually diminish over the following ten years. These notes may be redeemed on or after March 1, 2024, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus interest accrued to the date of redemption.

The
non-recourse mortgages, other mortgages and notes payable are primarily financings for real estate developments. We, including certain subsidiaries, had
$35.0 million in credit facilities as of December 31, 2007, with various financial institutions, in addition to obtaining loans with various lenders to finance these developments.

Outstanding
principal balances as of December 31, 2007, range from $3.0 million to $41.2 million per development with interest rates generally ranging from 5.5% to 8.1%.
Outstanding principal balances as of December 31, 2006, range from $0.3 million to $96.2 million per development with interest rates generally ranging from 5.5% to 8.6%.
Outstanding debt is secured by the underlying real estate properties, which were reported as real estate on our consolidated statements of financial position with a carrying value of
$141.1 million and $194.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Also
included in non-recourse mortgages and notes payable is a long-term debt obligation we assumed with the purchase of WM Advisors, Inc. As part of the
purchase, we will be bound by a class B share financing agreement previously entered into by WM Advisors, Inc. and a third party, which was assigned a value of $86.9 million at
purchase. Load mutual fund shares sold without a front end load are referred to as "B shares". In exchange for paying the selling commission, we receive fees in the future to recover the
up-front commission cost incurred. Prior to our purchase, WM Advisors, Inc. had entered into a purchase and sale agreement whereby the third party would purchase the rights to
future cash flow streams in exchange for funding the sales commissions. The fair value of these relinquished fees is reported as a long-term debt liability. There will be no additional
sales under this agreement following the effective date of the purchase. Therefore, this liability will be extinguished within eight years, which equates to the contractual term in which the fund can
recover fees to cover the upfront commission costs.

We
adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The application of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As of
December 31, 2007, the total unrecognized benefits were $98.8 million. Of this amount, $20.3 million, if recognized, would reduce the 2007 effective tax rate. We recognize
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in operating expenses. As of December 31, 2007, we had recognized $26.0 million of accumulated pre-tax interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, $10.3 million of which is included in our current year net income.

The
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed examinations of the U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns for 2003 and prior years. The IRS has commenced the audit of our
federal income tax returns for the years 2004 and 2005. We do not expect the results of these audits or developments in other tax areas to significantly increase or decrease the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months, but the outcome of tax reviews is uncertain, and unforeseen results can occur.

At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, our net deferred income tax liability includes international net deferred income tax liabilities of $182.1 million and
$162.6 million and U.S. net deferred income tax liabilities of $394.2 million and $754.6 million, which have been included in deferred income taxes in the consolidated statements
of financial position. In addition, at December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively, our net deferred income tax liability included international net deferred income tax assets of
$6.5 million and $10.2 million and U.S. net state deferred income tax assets of zero and $4.6 million, which have been included in other assets in the consolidated statements of
financial position.

In
management's judgment, the total deferred income tax asset is more likely than not of being realized. Included in the deferred income tax asset is the expected income tax benefit
attributable to net operating losses. Domestic state net operating loss carryforwards were $367.5 million as of December 31, 2007, and will expire between 2009 and 2023. Foreign net
operating loss carryforwards were $117.0 million as of December 31, 2007, and were generated in various foreign countries with expiration periods of 8 years to infinity. We
maintain valuation allowances by jurisdiction against the deferred income tax assets related to certain of these carryforwards, as utilization of these income tax benefits are not assured for certain
jurisdictions. A valuation allowance has been recorded on income tax benefits associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments to the
valuation allowance will be made if there is a change in management's assessment of the amount of the deferred income tax asset that is more likely than not of being realized. Accumulated net
operating losses of $263.8 million and $85.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are attributed to a captive reinsurance company that is temporarily excluded from
our consolidated federal income tax return. These net operating losses expire in 2021 and 2022. The captive reinsurance company will be able to join the consolidated income tax return in 2012 and it
is anticipated that all accumulated net operating losses will be utilized before expiration; therefore, there is no valuation allowance established for the deferred income tax assets established for
these net operating losses.

The
IRS has completed examinations of the U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns for 2003 and prior years. The IRS' completion of the examinations for the years
1999 - 2001 resulted in notices of deficiency dated December 29, 2004, and March 1, 2005. We paid the deficiencies (approximately $444.0 million for 1999
and 2000, and $1.3 million for 2001, including interest) in the first quarter of 2005 and have filed, or will file, claims for refund relating to the disputed adjustments. The examination for
the years 2002 and 2003 resulted in a refund of approximately $176.7 million (including interest) of which $161.5 million related to deficiencies previously paid as a result of the 1999
through 2001 examination. We believe that we have adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution of the contested issues could take several years
while legal remedies are pursued. Consequently, we do not expect the ultimate resolution of issues in tax years 1999 - 2003 to have a material impact on our net income.
Similarly, we believe


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

13. Income Taxes — (continued)

there
are adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, any challenges that might arise in tax years subsequent to 2003.

U.S.
Federal and state deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $328.0 million of accumulated but undistributed earnings from operations of foreign
subsidiaries at December 31, 2007. Such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. It is not practical to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax
liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted due to foreign tax credits and exclusions that may become available at the time of remittance. A tax liability will be recognized when we no
longer plan to indefinitely reinvest the earnings or when we plan to sell all or a portion of our ownership interest.

In
August 2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2007-54, which provides guidance on the methodology that life insurance companies use to calculate the dividends received deduction
relating to variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts. The deduction for dividends received reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the
difference between our periodic effective income tax rate and the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35%. In September 2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2007-61, which suspended Revenue
Ruling 2007-54, and indicated it would issue regulations to address the issues. No regulations have been proposed and we cannot predict whether any such regulations would affect our deduction
for dividends received by insurance company affiliates with respect to variable contracts.

On
October 22, 2004, The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 included a repatriation provision granting U.S.
corporations a special deduction of 85% of certain qualifying dividends from their foreign subsidiaries. A company could elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that are repatriated in
its 2005 tax year. Pursuant to The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, we implemented two domestic reinvestment plans in 2005. In accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, we
elected an 85% dividend received deduction on eligible cash dividends totaling $28.8 million.

Net
cash paid for income taxes was $245.9 million in 2007. Net cash paid for income taxes was $139.5 million in 2006, which included a $155.1 million audit refund
pertaining to prior tax years; and $638.1 million in 2005, primarily due to the notices of deficiency noted above.

14. Employee and Agent Benefits

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our employees and certain agents. Some of these plans provide supplemental pension benefits to
employees with salaries and/or pension benefits in excess of the qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law. The employees and agents are generally first eligible for the pension plans when they
reach age 21. For plan participants employed prior to January 1, 2002, the pension benefits are based on the greater of a final average pay benefit or a cash balance benefit. The final average
pay benefit is based on the years of service and generally the employee's or agent's average annual compensation during the last five years of employment. Partial benefit accrual of final average pay
benefits is recognized from first eligibility until retirement based on attained service divided by potential service to age 65 with a minimum of 35 years of potential service. The cash balance
portion of the plan started on January 1, 2002. An employee's account is credited with an amount based on the employee's salary, age and service. These credits accrue with interest. For plan
participants hired on and after January 1, 2002, only the cash balance plan applies. Our policy is to fund the cost of providing pension benefits in the years that the employees and agents are
providing service to us. Our funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plan is to contribute an amount annually at least equal to the minimum annual contribution required under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Our funding policy for the non-qualified
benefit plan is to fund the plan in the years that the employees are providing service to us using a methodology similar to the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost under U.S. GAAP, but
using long-term assumptions. However, if the U.S. GAAP funded status is positive, no deposit is made. While we designate assets to cover the computed liability of the
non-qualified plan, the assets are not included as part of the asset balances presented in this footnote as they do not qualify as plan assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

We
also provide certain health care, life insurance and long-term care benefits for retired employees. Subsidized retiree health benefits are provided for employees hired
prior to January 1, 2002. Employees hired after December 31, 2001, have access to retiree health benefits but are intended to pay for the full cost of the coverage. The health care plans
are contributory with participants' contributions adjusted annually; the contributions are based on the number of years of service and age at retirement for those hired prior to January 1,
2002. As part of the substantive plan, the retiree health contributions are assumed to be adjusted in the future as claim levels change. The life insurance plans are contributory for a small group of
previously grandfathered participants that have elected supplemental coverage and dependent coverage.


Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

14. Employee and Agent Benefits — (continued)

Covered employees are first eligible for the medical and life postretirement benefits when they reach age 57 and have completed ten years of service with us.
Retiree long-term care benefits are provided for employees whose retirement was effective prior to July 1, 2000. Partial benefit accrual of these health, life and
long-term care benefits is recognized from the employee's date of hire until retirement based on attained service divided by potential service to age 65 with a minimum of 35 years
of potential service. Our policy is to fund the cost of providing retiree benefits in the years that the employees are providing service to us using a methodology similar to the calculation of the net
periodic benefit cost under U.S. GAAP, but using long-term assumptions. However, if the U.S. GAAP funded status is positive, no deposit is made.

For
2007, we used a measurement date of October 1 for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For 2008, we will use a December 31 measurement date as required
by SFAS 158.

contributions to the pension plans include contributions made directly to the qualified pension plan assets and contributions from corporate assets to pay nonqualified pension
benefits. Benefits paid from the pension plans include both qualified and nonqualified plan benefits. Nonqualified pension plan assets are not included as part of the

asset
balances presented in this footnote. The nonqualified pension plan assets are held in a Rabbi trust for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. The assets held in a Rabbi trust are
available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy. Therefore, these assets are fully consolidated in our consolidated statements of financial position and are not
reflected in our funded status as they do not qualify as plan assets. The market value of assets held in these trusts was $237.2 million and $216.0 million as of December 31, 2007
and 2006, respectively.

Pension Plan Changes and Plan Gains/Losses

As of January 1, 2006, changes were made to our retirement program, including the Principal Select Saving Plan ("401(k)"), the Principal Pension Plan
("Pension Plan") and to the corresponding nonqualified plans. The qualified and nonqualified pension plan changes include a reduction to the traditional and cash balance formulas, a change in the
early retirement factors, and the removal of the cost of living adjustments for traditional benefits earned after January 1, 2006. The qualified and nonqualified 401(k) plan's company match
increased from 50% of a contribution rate up to a maximum of 3% of the participant's compensation to 75% of a contribution rate up to a maximum of 6% of the participant's compensation. Employees who
were at least 47 years old, with a minimum of 10 years of service as of December 31, 2005, were given the choice to remain under the current pension and 401(k) arrangement or move
to the new plan design. The vast majority of this group chose to remain under the current pension and 401(k) arrangement. The Pension Plan changes were recognized as a prior service credit and
resulted in a reduction of liabilities of $73.9 million at December 31, 2005.

On
January 1, 2008, the vesting schedule for the Principal Pension Plan changed to a three-year cliff schedule as required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. This
change was recognized as a prior service cost and resulted in an increase in liabilities of $4.3 million at December 31, 2007.

For
the year ended December 31, 2007, the pension plans had an actuarial loss of $33.3 million, primarily due to salary increases greater than assumed, which was partially
offset by the increase in the discount rate. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the pension plans had an actuarial gain of $43.0 million, primarily due to the increase in the discount
rate, which was partially offset by greater than expected salary increases.

Other Post Retirement Plan Changes and Plan Gains/Losses

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Medicare Modernization Act") was signed into law. The
Medicare Modernization Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare ("Medicare Part D") as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree medical benefit plans. During 2007 and
2006, the Medicare subsidies we received and accrued for were $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and included in service cost.

An
actuarial gain of $1.2 million occurred during 2007 for the other postretirement benefit plans. This was due to a less than assumed increase in health care claim costs, as well
as an increase in the discount rate. The gain was partially offset by an increase of the trend assumption. An actuarial gain of $47.1 million occurred during 2006 for the other postretirement
benefit plans. This was due to a less than assumed increase in health care claim costs and trend assumption, as well as an increase in the discount rate. Retiree contributions also increased more than
health care claim costs.

Information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:

The obligations below relate only to the nonqualified pension plan liabilities. As noted previously, the nonqualified plans have assets that are deposited in
trusts that fail to meet the U.S. GAAP requirements to be included in plan assets; however, these assets are included in our consolidated statements of financial position.

As
of and subsequent to December 31, 2006, net actuarial (gain) loss and net prior service cost benefit have been recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the
initial application of SFAS 158.

The
estimated net actuarial (gain) loss and prior service cost (benefit) that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost for the pension
benefits during the 2008 fiscal year are $1.1 million and $(7.7) million, respectively. The estimated net actuarial (gain) loss and prior service cost (benefit) for the postretirement benefits
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost during the 2008 fiscal year are $(3.2) million and $(2.5) million, respectively. During 2008,
additional amounts will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income as a direct adjustment to retained earnings due to the change in measurement date required by SFAS 158. For the
pension plans, $0.3 million will be amortized from net (gain) loss and $(1.9) million from prior service cost (benefit) due to the change in the measurement date. For the postretirement plans,
$(0.8) million will be amortized from net (gain) loss and $(0.6) million from prior service cost (benefit) due to the change in the measurement date.

For
other postretirement benefits, the 7.30% rate for 2007 is based on the weighted average expected long-term asset returns for the medical, life and long-term
care plans. The expected long-term rates for the medical, life and long-term care plans are 7.25%, 7.75% and 5.85%, respectively.

The
expected return on plan assets is the long-term rate we expect to be earned based on the plans' investment strategy. Historical and expected future returns of multiple
asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk free rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class. The overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term
inflation component, the risk free real rate of return and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on those overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plans.
Based on a review in 2005, the long term expected return on plan assets was lowered for the 2006 pension expense calculation.

Our
investment strategy is to achieve the following:

•

Obtain
a reasonable long-term return consistent with the level of risk assumed and at a cost of operation within prudent levels. Performance benchmarks are
monitored.

•

Ensure
sufficient liquidity to meet the emerging benefit liabilities for the plan.

•

Provide
for diversification of assets in an effort to avoid the risk of large losses and maximize the investment return to the pension plan consistent with market and
economic risk.

In
administering the qualified pension plan's asset allocation strategy, we consider the projected liability stream of benefit payments, the relationship between current and projected
assets of the plan and the projected actuarial liabilities streams, the historical performance of capital markets adjusted for the perception of future short- and long-term capital market
performance and the perception of future economic conditions.

Contributions

We do not expect to contribute to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2008. Our funding policy for the qualified pension plan is to fund the plan annually
in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contribution required under ERISA and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. We do not
anticipate that we will be required to fund a minimum annual contribution under ERISA for the qualified pension plan. At this time, it is too early to estimate the amount that may be contributed, but
it is possible that we may fund the plans in 2008 in the range of $20-$50 million. This includes funding for both our qualified and nonqualified pension plans.

In
addition, we have defined contribution plans that are generally available to all employees and agents. Eligible participants could not contribute more than $15,500 of their
compensation to the plans in 2007. Effective January 1, 2006, we made several changes to the retirement programs. In general, the pension and supplemental executive retirement plan benefit
formulas were reduced, and the 401(k) matching contribution was increased. Employees who were age 47 or older with at least ten years of service on December 31, 2005, could elect to retain the
prior benefit provisions and forgo receipt of the additional matching contributions. The employees who elected to retain the prior benefit provisions are referred to as "Grandfathered Choice
Participants". In 2006, we matched the Grandfathered Choice Participant's contribution at a 50% contribution rate up to a maximum contribution of 3% of the participant's compensation. For all other
participants, we matched the participant's contributions at a 75% contribution rate up to a maximum of 6% of the participant's compensation. The defined contribution plans allow employees to choose
among various investment options, including our common stock. We contributed $40.0 million, $36.4 million and $19.0 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, to our qualified
defined contribution plans.

We
also have a nonqualified defined contribution plan available to select employees and agents which allows them to contribute amounts in excess of limits imposed by federal tax law. In
2007 and 2006, we matched the Grandfathered Choice Participant's Contribution at a 50% contribution rate up to a maximum contribution of 3% of the participant's

compensation.
For all other participants, we matched the participant's contributions at a 75% contribution rate up to a maximum contribution of 6% of the participant's compensation. We contributed
$7.5 million, $8.0 million and $4.8 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, to our nonqualified defined contribution plans.

15. Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications

Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies

We are regularly involved in litigation, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff, but primarily as a defendant. Litigation naming us as a defendant ordinarily
arises out of our business operations as a provider of asset management and accumulation products and services, life, health and disability insurance. Some of the lawsuits are class actions, or
purport to be, and some include claims for punitive damages. In addition, regulatory bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (formerly known
as the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.), the Department of Labor and other regulatory bodies regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our
compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws, ERISA and laws governing the activities of broker-dealers. We receive requests from regulators and other governmental authorities
relating to other industry issues and may receive additional requests, including subpoenas and interrogatories, in the future.

Several
lawsuits have been filed against other insurance companies and insurance brokers alleging improper conduct relating to the payment and non-disclosure of contingent
compensation and bid-rigging activity. Several of these suits were filed as purported class actions. Several state attorneys general and insurance regulators have initiated
industry-wide inquiries or other actions relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers and insurance companies and other industry issues. Beginning in March of 2005, we
received subpoenas and interrogatories from the offices of the Attorneys General of New York and Connecticut seeking information related to compensation agreements with brokers and agents and the sale
of retirement products and services. In November 2007, we reached a settlement with the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut regarding a limited number of expense reimbursement arrangements
made with a few brokers who sold single premium group annuity policies. The policies primarily funded terminating defined benefit plans. The settlement called for us to establish a fund in the amount
of $4.4 million to be paid to plan sponsors who purchased single premium group annuity policies from brokers who received payments from us from 1998 through January 2006. We also agreed to pay
a penalty of $0.6 million to the State of Connecticut. We expect no further action to be taken by the Attorneys General of Connecticut and New York relating to these issues.

On
November 8, 2006, a trustee of Fairmount Park Inc. Retirement Savings Plan filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Illinois against Principal Life. Principal Life's Motion to Transfer Venue was granted and the case is now pending in the Southern District of Iowa. The complaint alleges, among other
things, that Principal Life breached its alleged fiduciary duties while performing services to 401(k) plans by failing to disclose, or adequately disclose, to employers or plan participants the fact
that Principal Life receives "revenue sharing fees from mutual funds that are included in its pre-packaged 401(k) plans" and allegedly failed to use the revenue to defray the expenses of
the services provided to the plans. Plaintiff further alleges that these acts constitute prohibited transactions under ERISA. Plaintiff seeks to certify a class of all retirement plans to which
Principal Life was a service provider and for which Principal Life received and retained "revenue sharing" fees from mutual funds. Plaintiff seeks declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief.
Principal Life is aggressively defending the lawsuit.

On
August 28, 2007, two plaintiffs filed two putative class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa against us and Princor Financial
Services Corporation (the "Principal Defendants"). One of the lawsuits alleges that the Principal Defendants breached alleged fiduciary duties to participants in employer-sponsored 401(k) plans who
were retiring or leaving their respective plans, including providing misleading information and failing to act solely in the interests of the participants, resulting in alleged violations of ERISA.
The Plaintiffs dismissed the second suit which was based upon the same facts and alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933. The Principal Defendants have
filed a Motion to Dismiss the remaining lawsuit.

While
the outcome of any pending or future litigation or regulatory matter cannot be predicted, management does not believe that any pending litigation or regulatory matter will have a
material adverse effect on our business or financial position. The outcome of such matters is always uncertain, and unforeseen results can occur. It is possible that such outcomes could materially
affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period.

15. Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications — (continued)

Guarantees and Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, we have provided guarantees to third parties primarily related to a former subsidiary, joint ventures and industrial revenue
bonds. These agreements generally expire through 2019. The maximum exposure under these agreements as of December 31, 2007, was approximately $193.0 million; however, we believe the
likelihood is remote that material payments will be required and therefore have not accrued for a liability on our consolidated statements of financial position. Should we be required to perform under
these guarantees, we generally could recover a portion of the loss from third parties through recourse provisions included in agreements with such parties, the sale of assets held as collateral that
can be liquidated in the event that performance is required under the guarantees or other recourse generally available to us, therefore, such guarantees would not result in a material adverse effect
on our business or financial position. It is possible that such outcomes could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period. The fair value of such guarantees is not material.

We
are also subject to various other indemnification obligations issued in conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. and
other divestitures, acquisitions and financing transactions whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Certain portions of these indemnifications may be capped, while other
portions are not subject to such limitations; therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under the indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. While we are unable to estimate with
certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these indemnifications, we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments would be required under such indemnifications
and therefore such indemnifications would not
result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. It is possible that such outcomes could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period. The fair value
of such indemnifications was determined to be insignificant.

Operating Leases

As a lessee, we lease office space, data processing equipment, office furniture and office equipment under various operating leases. Rental expense for the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, was $53.6 million, $54.8 million and $58.3 million.

At
December 31, 2007, the future minimum lease payments are $191.7 million. The following represents payments due by period for operating lease obligations as of

Securities Lending

We participate in a securities lending program whereby certain fixed maturity securities from the investment portfolio are loaned to other institutions for a
short period of time. We maintain ownership of the loaned securities. Both we and the borrower can request or return the loaned securities at any time. We require initial cash collateral equal to
102 percent of the market value of the loaned securities. The collateral is invested by the lending agent in accordance with our guidelines. Net returns on the investments, after payment of a
rebate to the borrower, are shared between the agent and us. The transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing and the collateral is recorded as an asset on our statement of financial position,
with a corresponding liability reflecting our obligation to return the collateral upon the return of the loaned securities.

As
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had received $622.7 million and $672.1 million, respectively, of cash collateral on securities lending. The cash collateral is
included in other assets with a corresponding liability recorded in other liabilities. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had loaned securities with a fair value of $608.9 million and
$655.3 million, respectively.

Securities Posted as Collateral

We posted $807.7 million in securities under collateral agreements at December 31, 2007, to satisfy collateral requirements primarily associated
with our derivatives credit support agreements and a reinsurance arrangement.

Letters of Credit

We have entered into an agreement with a third party who issues standby letters of credit on behalf of a wholly-owned captive reinsurance subsidiary. The letters
of credit are used to support a portion of the statutory reserves assumed by our captive reinsurance company. The letters of credit also allow Principal Life to take credit for ceded reserves on its
statutory balance sheet. As of December 31, 2007, there was a total of $365.0 million in outstanding letters of credit.

16. Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock

As of December 31, 2007, we had 13.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized, issued and outstanding under the two series described below.
Preferred stockholders have dividend and liquidation priority over common stockholders.

Series A.

On June 16, 2005, we issued 3.0 million shares of fixed rate,
non-cumulative, Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"), at an initial offering price of $100 per share. We received net proceeds of
$296.0 million after offering costs. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and are payable quarterly when, and if, declared by our Board of Directors.
Dividends commenced on September 30, 2005, at a rate of 5.563% per annum of the liquidation preference. On or after the dividend payment date in June 2015, the Series A initial
distribution rate will become a floating rate, subject to reset, at our option, subject to certain conditions and parameters. If reset, the rate may be at fixed or floating rates. On or after the
dividend payment date in June 2015, we may, at our

option,
redeem the shares at a price of $100 per share, or $300.0 million in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the then current dividend period to the date of redemption, if
any.

The
Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not convertible into any other of our securities. Series A Preferred Stock will have no voting rights, except
with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the shares and in the case of certain dividend non-payments.

Series B.

On June 16, 2005, we issued 10.0 million shares of fixed rate,
non-cumulative, Series B Perpetual Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred Stock"), at an initial offering price of $25 per share. We received net proceeds of
$246.0 million after offering costs. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and are payable quarterly when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors.
Dividends commenced on September 30, 2005, at a rate of 6.518% per annum of the liquidation preference. On or after the dividend payment date in June 2035, the Series B initial
distribution rate will become a floating rate, subject to reset, at our option, subject to certain conditions and parameters. If reset, the rate may be at fixed or floating rates. On or after the
dividend payment date in June 2015, we may, at our option, redeem the shares at a price of $25 per share, or $250.0 million in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the then
current dividend period to the date of redemption, if any.

The
Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not convertible into any other of our securities. Series B Preferred Stock will have no voting rights, except
with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the shares and in the case of certain dividend non-payments.

Dividend Restrictions and Payments

The certificates of designations for the Series A and B Preferred Stock restrict the declaration of preferred dividends if we fail to meet specified
capital adequacy, net income or stockholders' equity levels. As of December 31, 2007, we have no preferred dividend restrictions.

On
March 30, 2007, July 2, 2007, October 1, 2007, and December 31, 2007, we paid a dividend of $8.2 million, $8.3 million, $8.2 million
and $8.3 million, respectively, equal to $1.39 per share on Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and equal to $0.41 per share on Series B
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. Dividends were paid to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2007, June 14, 2007, September 13, 2007, and
December 13, 2007, respectively.

On
March 30, 2006, June 30, 2006, October 2, 2006, and January 2, 2007, we paid a dividend of $8.3 million, $8.2 million, $8.3 million
and $8.2 million, respectively, equal to $1.39 per share on Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and equal to $0.41 per share on Series B
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock.
Dividends were paid to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2006, June 15, 2006, September 14, 2006, and December 14, 2006, respectively.

On
September 30, 2005, and December 30, 2005, we paid a dividend of $9.4 million, and $8.3 million, respectively, equal to $1.59 per share and $1.39 per
share, respectively, on Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and equal to $0.47 per share and $0.41 per share, respectively, on Series B
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, to stockholders of record as of September 1, 2005, and December 15, 2005, respectively.

Common Stock

On December 7, 2007, we paid an annual dividend of $235.6 million, equal to $0.90 per share, to stockholders of record as of November 16,
2007. On December 15, 2006, we paid an annual dividend of $214.7 million, equal to $0.80 per share, to stockholders of record as of November 22, 2006. On December 16, 2005,

paid $250.0 million and received the initial delivery of 2.9 million common shares, while retaining the right to receive additional common shares over the program's execution period. The
accelerated common stock repurchase agreement was completed in January 2008, at which time we received 0.9 million additional common shares under this agreement. As of December 31, 2007,
$250.0 million remained available under the November 2007 authorization.

On
May 19, 2006, following our Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization, we entered into an accelerated common stock repurchase agreement with a third party investment
bank for an aggregate purchase price of $500.0 million. On this date, we paid $500.0 million and received the initial delivery of 7.7 million common shares, while retaining the
right to receive additional common shares depending on the volume weighted average share price of our common stock over the program's duration. The program was completed in November 2006. Under this
program, we purchased a total of 9.3 million common shares.

In
June 2005, following our Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization of up to 15.0 million shares, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with a third
party investment bank for approximately 13.7 million shares of our common stock with an initial payment of $542.3 million, using cash proceeds from the preferred stock issuance. The
transaction was subject to a market price adjustment provision based on the volume weighted average market price over the execution period, which could be settled in shares or cash. On
October 3, 2005, we elected to settle in cash. On November 10, 2005, the transaction was completed for an additional payment of $84.0 million.

In
the last three years, our Board of Directors has authorized various repurchase programs under which we are allowed to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. Shares
repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock, carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to stockholders' equity.

Dividend Limitations

Under Iowa law, Principal Life may pay stockholder dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the
Commissioner to pay a stockholder dividend if such a stockholder dividend would exceed certain statutory limitations. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of Principal Life's
policyholder surplus as of the preceding year-end or the net gain from operations from the previous calendar year. Based on this limitation and 2007 statutory results, Principal Life could
pay approximately $686.5 million in stockholder dividends in 2008 without exceeding the statutory limitation.

17. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following discussion describes the methods and assumptions we utilize in estimating our fair value disclosures for financial instruments. Certain financial
instruments, particularly policyholder liabilities other than investment-type contracts, are excluded from these fair value disclosure requirements. The techniques utilized in estimating
the fair values of financial instruments are affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows. Care should be exercised in
deriving conclusions about our business, its value or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below. The estimates shown are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a one-time, current market exchange of all of our financial instruments.

We
define fair value as the quoted market prices for those instruments that are actively traded in financial markets. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are estimated using present value or other valuation techniques. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about the financial
instrument, including estimates of timing, amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer. Such estimates do not consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized
gains or losses. In some cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets. In addition, the disclosed fair value may not be realized in the immediate
settlement of the financial instrument.

Fair
values of public debt and equity securities have been determined by us from public quotations, when available. Private placement securities and other corporate security fixed
maturities where we do not receive a public quotation are valued by discounting the expected total cash flows. Market rates used are applicable to the yield, credit quality and average maturity of
each security. Private equity securities may also utilize internal valuation methodologies appropriate for the specific asset. Fair values might also be determined using broker quotes.

Fair
values of commercial and residential mortgage loans are determined by discounting the expected total cash flows using market rates that are applicable to the yield, credit quality
and maturity of each loan.

Fair
values of policy loans are estimated by discounting expected cash flows using a risk-free rate based on the U.S. Treasury curve.

Fair
values of derivative instruments are determined using either pricing valuation models that utilize market data inputs or broker quotes. The valuation models consider projected
discounted cash flows, relevant swap curves and appropriate implied volatilities.

The
fair value of seed money investments classified as other investments is determined using the net asset value of the fund. The fair values for other assets classified as other
investments, excluding derivative assets, seed money investments and equity investments in subsidiaries, and cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position
approximate their carrying amounts.

The
fair value of our securities lending collateral and securities lending payable approximate their carrying value.

Separate
account assets include public equity, public and private debt securities, commercial mortgage loans and derivative instruments for which fair values are determined as previously
described. Separate account assets also include real estate for which the fair value is estimated using valuation models.

The
fair values of our reserves and liabilities for investment-type insurance contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on current interest rates
being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the investment-type contracts being valued. Investment-type insurance contracts include
insurance, annuity and other policy contracts that do not involve significant mortality or morbidity risk and that are only a portion of the policyholder liabilities appearing in the consolidated
statements of financial position. Insurance contracts include insurance, annuity and other policy contracts that do involve significant mortality or morbidity risk. The fair values for our insurance
contracts, other than investment-type contracts, are not required to be disclosed. We do consider, however, the various insurance and investment risks in choosing investments for both
insurance and investment-type contracts.

Fair
values for debt issues are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on our incremental borrowing rate for similar borrowing arrangements.

18. Statutory Insurance Financial Information

Principal Life, the largest indirect subsidiary of Principal Financial Group, Inc., prepares statutory financial statements in accordance with the
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa (the "State of Iowa"). The State of Iowa recognizes only statutory accounting
practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Iowa for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company to determine its solvency under the Iowa
Insurance Law. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' ("NAIC")

Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual

has been adopted as a component
of prescribed practices by the State of Iowa. The Commissioner has the right to permit other specific practices that deviate from prescribed practices.

Life
and health insurance companies are subject to certain risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements as specified by the NAIC. Under those requirements, the amount of capital
and surplus maintained by a life and health insurance company is to be determined based on the various risk factors related to it. At December 31, 2007, Principal Life meets the minimum RBC
requirements.

Statutory
net income and statutory surplus of Principal Life were as follows:

19. Segment Information

We provide financial products and services through the following segments: U.S. Asset Accumulation, Global Asset Management, International Asset Management and
Accumulation and Life and Health Insurance. In addition, there is a Corporate and Other segment. The segments are managed and reported separately because they provide different products and services,
have different strategies or have different markets and distribution channels.

Prior
to 2007, amounts now reported in the U.S. Asset Accumulation segment and the Global Asset Management segment were reported together in the U.S. Asset Management and Accumulation
segment. This change was made due to continued growth in our Global Asset Management business and has no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any period presented. Our segment results
for 2006 and 2005 have been restated to conform to the current segment presentation.

The
U.S. Asset Accumulation segment provides retirement and related financial products and services primarily to businesses, their employees and other individuals.

The
Global Asset Management segment provides asset management services to our asset accumulation business, our life and health insurance operations, the Corporate and Other segment and
third-party clients.

The
International Asset Management and Accumulation segment consists of Principal International, which has operations in Brazil, Chile, China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and Mexico. We
focus on countries with favorable demographics and growing long-term savings and defined contribution markets. We entered these countries through acquisitions, start-up
operations and joint ventures.

The
Life and Health insurance segment provides individual life insurance, group health insurance and specialty benefits, which consists of group dental and vision insurance, individual
and group disability insurance and group life insurance, throughout the United States.

The
Corporate and Other segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate and Other segment primarily
reflect our financing activities (including interest expense), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other
after-tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items.

Management
uses segment operating earnings for goal setting, determining employee compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts. We
determine segment operating earnings by adjusting U.S. GAAP net income available to common stockholders for net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other
after-tax adjustments which management believes are not indicative of overall operating trends. Net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, are net of income taxes,
related changes in the amortization pattern of DPAC and sales inducements, recognition of front-end fee revenues for sales charges on pension products and services, net realized capital
gains and losses distributed, minority interest capital gains and losses and certain market value adjustments to fee revenues. Net realized/unrealized capital gains (losses), as adjusted, exclude
periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments. Segment operating revenues exclude net realized/unrealized capital gains (except periodic settlements and accruals on
non-hedge derivatives) and their impact on recognition of front-end fee revenues and certain market value adjustments to fee revenues and include operating revenues from real
estate properties that qualify for discontinued operations. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing the consolidated financial performance, management believes
the presentation of segment operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the business.

The
accounting policies of the segments are consistent with the accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of income tax allocation. The Corporate
and Other segment functions to absorb the risk inherent in interpreting and applying tax law. The segments are allocated tax adjustments consistent with the positions we took on tax returns. The
Corporate and Other segment results reflect any differences between the tax returns and the estimated resolution of any disputes.

20. Stock-Based Compensation Plans

As of December 31, 2007, we have the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, the Stock Incentive Plan,
the Directors Stock Plan and the Long-Term Performance Plan ("Stock-Based Compensation Plans"). As of May 17, 2005, no new grants will be made under the Stock Incentive Plan, the
Directors Stock Plan or the Long-Term Performance Plan. Under the terms of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, grants may be nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options qualifying under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, or other stock based awards. The 2005
Directors Stock Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or other stock-based awards to our nonemployee directors. To date, we have not
granted any incentive stock options, restricted stock, or performance units.

As
of December 31, 2007, the maximum number of new shares of common stock that were available for grant under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2005 Directors Stock Plan was
19.1 million.

Nonqualified Stock Options

Nonqualified stock options were granted to certain employees under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the Stock Incentive Plan. Options outstanding under the 2005
Stock Incentive Plan and the Stock Incentive Plan were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and expire ten years after the grant date.
These options have graded or cliff vesting over a three-year period, except in the case of approved retirement. Total options granted under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the Stock
Incentive Plan were 1.8 million, 2.1 million and 2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Nonqualified
stock options granted under the Directors stock plans have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant and a contractual
term equal to the earlier of five years from the date the participant ceases to provide service or the tenth anniversary of the date the option was granted. Beginning with the 2003 grant, options
become exercisable in four approximately equal installments on the three, six and nine month anniversaries of the grant date, and on the date that the Director's full term of office expires. There
were no options granted during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

The
weighted-average remaining contractual lives for stock options exercisable is approximately 6 years as of December 31, 2007.

The
fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following is a summary of the assumptions used in this model for the stock options granted
during the period:

We
previously determined expected volatility for stock options granted based on, among other factors, historical volatility using monthly price observations. Beginning with stock options
granted in 2007, we determine expected volatility based on, among other factors, historical volatility using daily price observations. We believe that daily price observations provide a better
estimate of expected fluctuations in our stock price over the expected term of stock options granted. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding and is estimated based on the simplified method as described by the SEC. We do not believe we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate
expected term due to the limited period of time our stock has been publicly traded. We expect to use historical exercise and employee termination data to develop our expected term as soon as
sufficient data becomes available. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury risk-free interest rate in effect at the
time of grant. The dividend yield is based on historical dividend distributions compared to the closing price of our common shares on the grant date.

As
of December 31, 2007, there were $14.4 million of total unrecognized compensations costs related to nonvested stock options. The cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average service period of approximately 1.9 years.

Cash
received from stock options exercised under these share-based payment arrangements during 2007 and 2006 was $41.9 million and $37.7 million, respectively. The actual
tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for option exercise of the share-based payment arrangements during 2007 and 2006 was $12.0 million and $12.7 million, respectively.

Performance Share Awards

Beginning in 2006, we granted performance share awards to certain employees under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. The performance share awards are treated as an
equity award and are paid in shares. Whether the performance shares are earned depends upon the participant's continued employment through the performance period (except in the case of an approved
retirement) and our performance against three-year goals set at the beginning of the performance period. A return on equity objective and an earnings per share objective must be achieved
for any of the performance shares to be earned. If the performance requirements are not met, the performance shares will be forfeited, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. There is no maximum contractual term on these awards. Total performance share awards granted were 0.3 million and 0.4 million in 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Performance
share awards above represent initial target awards and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the final performance objectives to be determined at the
end of the respective performance period. The actual number of shares to be awarded at the end of each performance period will range between 0% and 200% of the initial target awards.

The
fair value of performance share awards is determined based on the closing stock price of our shares on the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of
performance share awards granted during 2007 and 2006 were $62.73 and $49.40, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2007, there were $15.1 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance share awards granted. The cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average service period of approximately 1.6 years.

Because
no performance share awards vested or were paid out, the intrinsic value of performance share awards vested and the actual tax benefits realized for tax deductions for
performance share award payouts were $0.0 million in 2007 and 2006.

Restricted Stock Units

We issue restricted stock units under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, 2005 Directors Stock Plan, Stock Incentive Plan, and Directors Stock Plan. Restricted stock
units are treated as an equity award. There is no maximum contractual
term on these awards. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, 0.4 million, 0.2 million and 0.4 million restricted stock units were granted, respectively.

Restricted
stock units were issued to certain employees and agents pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan and 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. Under these plans, awards have a graded or cliff
vesting over a three-year service period. When service for PFG ceases (except in the case of an approved retirement), all vesting stops and unvested units are forfeited.

Beginning
in 2005, pursuant to the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, restricted stock units are now granted to each non-employee director in office immediately following each annual
meeting of stockholders and to each person who becomes a member of the Board other than on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. Prior to this time, awards of restricted stock units were
granted pursuant to the Directors Stock Plan on the date of each Board member's election or re-election date. Under the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, awards are granted on an annual basis and
cliff vest after a one-year service period. Awards under the prior plan had graded vesting over a three-year service period and are fully vested. When service to PFG ceases,
all vesting stops and unvested units are forfeited.

The
total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested was $24.2 million, $16.7 million and $1.3 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

The
fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing stock price of our common shares on the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of
restricted stock units granted during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $61.38, $50.42 and $39.55, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2007, there were $13.5 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards granted under these plans. The
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years.

The
actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for restricted stock unit payouts under these share-based payment arrangements for 2007 and 2006 was $6.5 million and
$5.4 million, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, participating employees have the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock on a quarterly basis. Employees may
purchase up to $25,000 worth of company stock each year. Employees may purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the shares' fair market value as of the beginning or end of the
quarter, whichever is lower. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, employees purchased 0.6 million, 0.7 million and 0.7 million shares during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

We
recognize compensation expense for the fair value of the discount granted to employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan in the quarter of grant. Shares of the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan are treated as an equity award. The weighted-average fair value of the discount on the stock purchased was $10.45, $10.39 and $8.00 during 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. The total intrinsic value of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares settled was $6.5 million, $6.9 million and $5.8 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively.

Cash
received from shares issued under these share-based payment arrangements for 2007 and 2006 was $31.7 million and $28.5 million, respectively. The actual tax benefits
realized for the tax deductions for the settlement of the share-based payment arrangements for 2007 and 2006 was $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

The
maximum number of shares of common stock that we may issue under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is 2% of the number of shares outstanding immediately following the completion of
the Initial Public Offering. As of December 31, 2007, a total of 2.7 million of new shares are available to be made issuable by us for this plan.

Long-Term Performance Plan

We also maintain the Long-Term Performance Plan, which provides the opportunity for eligible executives to receive additional awards if specified
minimum corporate performance objectives are achieved over a
three-year period. This plan utilizes stock as an option for payment and is treated as a liability award during vesting and a liability award or equity award subsequent to vesting, based
on the participant payment election. Effective with stockholder approval of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, no further grants will be made under the Long-Term Performance Plan, and any
future awards paid under the Long-Term Performance Plan will be issued under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2005, all awards under this plan were fully vested and
no awards were granted under this plan in 2007, 2006 or 2005. There is no maximum contractual term on these awards.

23. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information

Principal Life has established special purpose entities to issue secured medium-term notes. Under the program, the payment obligations of principal
and interest on the notes are secured by funding agreements issued by Principal Life. Principal Life's payment obligations on the funding agreements are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
Principal Financial Group, Inc. All of the outstanding stock of Principal Life is indirectly owned by Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Principal Financial Group, Inc. is the
only guarantor of the payment obligations of the funding agreements.

We
received a subpoena on March 31, 2005 from the Attorney General of West Virginia for documents and other information relating to funding agreement-backed securities, special
purpose vehicles related to funding agreement-backed securities, and related subjects. A response has been sent. We understand that other U.S.-based life insurers that have funding agreement-backed
note programs such as our ongoing programs have received similar subpoenas from the Attorney General of West Virginia. Other than the subpoena, we have received no notification of any pending or
threatened investigation or other proceeding by West Virginia governmental authorities involving funding agreement-backed securities.

June 30, 2004, our shelf registration statement with the SEC was declared effective. Following our October and November 2006 issuances of debt securities under the shelf
registration, we now have the ability to issue up to $1.85 billion of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of Principal
Financial Group, Inc. and trust preferred securities of three subsidiary trusts. If we issue additional securities, we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the securities offered by the
prospectus, including the corresponding junior subordinated debentures issued to the trusts in connection with their investment of all the
proceeds from the sale of preferred securities, for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, investments in subsidiaries, share repurchase, acquisitions and
refinancing of debt, including commercial paper and other short-term indebtedness. Principal Financial Services, Inc. unconditionally guarantees our obligations with respect to one
or more series of debt securities described in the shelf registration statement.

The
following tables set forth condensed consolidating financial information of Principal Financial Services, Inc. and Principal Financial Group, Inc. as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Principal Financial Group, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer, J. Barry Griswell, and our Chief Financial Officer, Michael H. Gersie, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in

Internal Controls — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management has concluded that Principal Financial
Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

Ernst &
Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K,
has issued an attestation report regarding internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report is included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In order to ensure that the information that we must disclose in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, we
have adopted disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file with or submit to the SEC is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our
Chief Executive Officer, J. Barry Griswell, and our Chief Financial Officer, Michael H. Gersie, have reviewed and evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2007, and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Schedules

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

We
have audited the consolidated financial statements of Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("the Company") as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2007, and have issued our report thereon dated February 19, 2008 (included elsewhere in this Form 10-K). Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15.a.2. of this Form 10-K. These schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion based on our audits.

In
our opinion, the financial statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in response to new accounting standards, the Company changed its methods of
accounting for certain non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets (primarily real estate) effective July 1, 2005, its pension and other post-retirement benefits
effective December 31, 2006, and for the treatment of modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts and income tax contingencies effective January 1, 2007.

The
amount shown in the Statement of Financial Position for mortgage loans differs from cost as mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances.

(2)

The
amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position for real estate differ from cost due to properties which were determined to be impaired. The cost bases of these properties
are reduced to fair value. Real estate expected to be disposed is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with valuation allowances established.

(3)

The
amount shown in the Statement of Financial Position for other investments differs from cost due to accumulated earnings from minority interests in unconsolidated entities and
properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners. Other investments also includes derivatives and certain seed money investments, which are reported at fair value.
