Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

PART I

Item 1.    Business

Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("PFG") is a leader in global investment management offering businesses, individuals and institutional
clients a wide range of financial products and services, including retirement, asset management and insurance through our diverse family of financial services companies. We had $591.6 billion
in assets under management ("AUM") and approximately 22.1 million customers worldwide as of December 31, 2016.

Our
global asset management businesses serve a broad range of investors in 76 countries through offices in 19 countries, including in the major financial centers worldwide. We provide
long-term investment strategies to institutional, retirement, high net worth and retail clients by offering a range of capabilities including equity, fixed income, real estate and other alternative
investments, as well as fund offerings.

In
the U.S., we primarily focus on small and medium-sized businesses, which we define as companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, by offering a broad array of retirement and employee
benefit solutions and individual insurance solutions to meet the needs of the business owner and their employees. We are a leading provider of corporate defined contribution plans. We are also a
leading employee stock ownership plan consultant. In addition, we are a leading provider of nonqualified plans, defined benefit plans and plan termination annuities. We are also one of the largest
providers of specialty benefits insurance product solutions. We believe small and medium-sized businesses are an underserved market, offering attractive growth opportunities in the retirement and
employee benefit markets.

Additionally,
we believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage our U.S. retirement expertise in select international markets that have adopted or are moving toward private sector
defined contribution pension systems. Our international asset management and accumulation businesses focus on the opportunities created as aging populations around the world drive increased demand for
retirement accumulation, retirement asset management and retirement income management solutions.

Our Reportable Segments

We organize our businesses into the following reportable segments:

•

Retirement and Income Solutions;

•

Principal Global Investors;

•

Principal International and

•

U.S. Insurance Solutions.

We
also have a Corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment.

See
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16, Segment Information" for financial results of our segments.

Retirement and Income Solutions Segment

Our asset accumulation activities in the U.S. date back to the 1940s when we first began providing pension plan products and services. We now
offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for retirement savings and retirement income:

•

To businesses of all sizes with a concentration on small and medium-sized businesses, we offer products and services for defined contribution
plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans, nonqualified executive benefit plans, employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") services and full service payout services. For
more basic retirement services, we offer SIMPLE Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA") and payroll deduction plans;

•

To large institutional clients, we also offer investment only products, including investment only guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs"); and

•

To employees of businesses and other individuals, we offer the ability to accumulate savings for retirement and other purposes through mutual
funds, individual annuities and bank products.

We
organize our Retirement and Income Solutions operations into two business groupings:

•

Retirement and Income Solutions — Fee: includes full service accumulation, trust services and individual variable annuities;
and

•

Retirement and Income Solutions — Spread: includes individual fixed annuities, investment only, full service payout and
banking services.



Retirement and Income Solutions — Fee

Full Service Accumulation

We offer a wide variety of investment and administrative products and services for defined contribution plans, including 401(k) and 403(b)
plans; defined benefit pension plans; nonqualified executive benefit plans and ESOPs. A 403(b) plan is a plan described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides
retirement benefits for employees of tax-exempt organizations and public schools.

Products

Full service accumulation products respond to the needs of plan sponsors seeking both administrative and investment services for defined
contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The investment component of both the defined contribution and defined benefit plans may be in the form of a guaranteed account, separate account, a mutual
fund offering or a collective investment trust. In addition, defined contribution plan sponsors may also offer their own employer securities as an investment option under the plan.

We
deliver both administrative and investment services to our defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan customers through annuity contracts, collective investment trusts and
mutual funds. Group annuity contracts and collective investment trusts used to fund qualified plans are not required to be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
Our mutual fund service platform is called Principal Advantage. It is a qualified plan service package based on our series mutual fund, Principal Funds, Inc. ("PFI"). We offer investments
covering the full range of stable value, equity, fixed income, real estate and international investment options managed by our Principal Global Investors segment as well as third party asset managers.
In addition, full service accumulation offers plan sponsors trust services through an affiliated trust company.

As
of December 31, 2016, we provided full service accumulation products to (a) over 35,900 defined contribution plans, of which over 30,900 were 401(k) plans, including
$134.3 billion in assets and covering 4.6 million eligible plan participants, and (b) to over 2,100 defined benefit plans, including $19.3 billion in assets and covering
over 306,400 eligible plan participants. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 56% of our full service accumulation account values were managed by our Principal Global Investors segment. Third
party asset managers provide asset management services with respect to the remaining assets. As it relates to our full service accumulation account values, 28% were managed entirely by the third party
asset managers that were not under contract to sub-advise a PFG product, 9% were sub-advised and 7% represented employer securities.

Markets and Distribution

We offer our full service accumulation products and services to plans, including qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans and
defined benefit plans. Our primary target market is plans sponsored by small and medium-sized businesses, which we believe remains under-penetrated. According to Retirement Resources, Inc., in
2015, only 24% of businesses with between 10 and 49 employees, 51% of businesses with between 50 and 99 employees, 61% of businesses with between 100 and 249 employees and 73% of businesses with
between 250 and 499 employees offered a 401(k) plan. The same study indicates that 81% of employers with between 500 and 999 employees, 95% of employers with between 1,000 and 4,999 employees and 95%
of employers with 5,000 or more employees offered a 401(k) plan in 2015.

We
distribute our full service accumulation products and services nationally, primarily through a captive retirement services sales force. As of December 31, 2016, 108 retirement
services sales representatives in 41 offices, operating as a wholesale distribution network, maintained relationships with over 16,000 independent advisors, consultants and agents. Retirement services
sales representatives are an integral part of the sales process alongside the referring consultant or independent advisor. We compensate retirement services sales representatives through a blend of
salary and production-based incentives, while we pay independent advisors, consultants and agents a commission or fee.

As
of December 31, 2016, we had a separate staff of over 260 service and education specialists located in the sales offices. These specialists play a key role in the ongoing
servicing of plans by providing local services to our customers, such as reviewing plan performance, investment options and plan design; communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us and
helping employees understand the benefits of their plans. The following summarizes our distribution channels:

•

We distribute our annuity-based products through intermediaries who are primarily state licensed individuals.

•

Principal Advantage platform is targeted at defined contribution plans through broker-dealer distribution channels. Principal Advantage gives
us access to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority-registered distributors who are not traditional sellers of annuity-based products and broadens opportunities for us in the investment advisor and
broker-dealer distribution channels.

•

Through our Retire Secure strategy we provide financial education and other assistance to individual investors who are participants/members of
employer-based accumulation solutions to help them achieve financial security.

We
believe our approach to full service accumulation plan services distribution, which gives us a local sales and service presence, differentiates us from many of our competitors. We
have also established a number of marketing and distribution relationships to increase the sales of our products and services.



Individual Variable Annuities

We offer variable annuities to individuals and plans. Individual variable annuities are savings vehicles through which the customer makes one or
more deposits of varying amounts and intervals.

Products

Our individual variable deferred annuities provide customers with the flexibility to allocate their deposits to mutual funds managed by the
Principal Global Investors segment or unaffiliated third party asset managers. As of December 31, 2016, 92% of our $9.4 billion in variable annuity account balances was allocated to
mutual funds managed by the Principal Global Investors segment and our guaranteed option. The remaining 8% was allocated to mutual funds managed by unaffiliated third party asset managers. Generally
speaking, the customers bear the investment risk for the variable options and have the right to allocate their assets among various separate mutual funds. The value of the annuity fluctuates in
accordance with the experience of the mutual funds chosen by the customer. Customers have the option to allocate all or a portion of their account to our guaranteed option, in which case we credit
interest at rates we determine, subject to contractual minimums.

Customers
may elect a living benefit guarantee (commonly known in the industry as a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or "GMWB"). We bear the GMWB investment risk. Our goal is to
hedge the GMWB investment risk through the use of sophisticated risk management techniques. As of December 31, 2016, $6.3 billion of the $9.0 billion of variable annuity separate
account values had the GMWB rider. Our major source of revenue from variable annuities is mortality and expense fees we charge to the customer, generally determined as a percentage of the market value
of the assets held in a separate investment sub-account. Account balances of variable annuity contracts with the GMWB rider were invested in separate account investment options as follows:

Markets and Distribution

Our target markets for individual variable annuities include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses and
individuals seeking to accumulate and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market variable annuities to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified retirement savings.

We
sell our individual variable annuity products through our affiliated financial representatives, who accounted for 96%, 95% and 93% of annuity sales for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The remaining sales were made through banks, brokerage general agencies, mutual fund companies, Principal Connection and unaffiliated
broker-dealer firms. Principal Connection is our direct response distribution channel for retail financial services products to individuals. Principal Connection's services are available over the
phone, on the internet or by mail. Affiliated financial representatives continued to be the primary distribution channel of our variable deferred annuities.

Retirement and Income Solutions — Spread

Individual Fixed Annuities

Individual fixed annuities may be categorized in two ways: (1) deferred, in which case assets accumulate until the contract is
surrendered, the customer dies or the customer begins receiving benefits under an annuity payout option, or (2) payout, in which case payments are made for a fixed period of time or for life.

Products

Fixed Deferred Annuities.

Our individual fixed deferred annuities consist of both single premium deferred annuity contracts and
flexible premium
deferred annuity contracts ("FPDAs"). Some FPDA contracts limit the period of time deposits are allowed (e.g., only one year). For certain contracts, the principal amount is guaranteed. We
credit the customer's account with a fixed interest rate for a specified number of years. Thereafter, we reset the interest rate credited to the contract based upon our discretion, subject to
contractual minimums, by taking into account market and other conditions. We also offer a fixed deferred annuity where the interest credited is linked to an external equity index, subject to maximum
and minimum values. One source of income from fixed deferred annuities is the difference between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited to
the contracts. We bear the investment risk because, while we credit customers' accounts with a stated interest rate, we cannot be certain the



investment
income we earn on our general account assets will exceed that rate. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Fixed Income Annuities.

Our individual fixed income annuities consist of single premium immediate annuity contracts ("SPIAs")
and deferred income
annuity contracts ("DIAs"). SPIAs and DIAs are products where the customer pays a premium in return for periodic benefit payments. SPIA payments begin immediately and DIA payments begin after a
deferral period, during which a return-of-premium death benefit is included. Payments may be contingent upon the survival of one or two individuals or payments may be fixed, meaning payments are
contractually guaranteed and do not depend on the continuing survival of any individual. Our major source of income from fixed immediate annuities is the difference between the investment income
earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate implied in the calculation of annuity benefit payments. We bear the investment risk because we cannot be certain the investment
income we earn on our general account assets will exceed the rate implied in the SPIA and DIA contracts. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Markets and Distribution

Our target markets for individual fixed annuities include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses and individuals
seeking to accumulate and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market fixed annuities to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified retirement savings.

We
sell our individual fixed annuity products through our affiliated financial representatives, who accounted for 7%, 6% and 11% of annuity sales for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The remaining sales were made through banks, brokerage general agencies, mutual fund companies, Principal Connection and unaffiliated broker-dealer firms. The
majority of overall annuity sales, however, were from non-affiliated distribution channels, as a result of focused efforts to increase fixed annuity sales through these channels.

Investment Only

Products

The two primary products for which we provide investment only services are: GICs and funding agreements.

GICs
and funding agreements pay a specified rate of return. The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment only products
contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.

Deposits
to investment only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to another. The
amounts earned by us are derived in part from the difference between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the
assets supporting the contractual promises.

Markets and Distribution

We issue GICs and funding agreements primarily to plan sponsors and other institutions. We also offer GICs as part of our full service
accumulation products. We issue our GICs primarily to tax-qualified retirement plans. We sell our funding agreements directly to institutions that may or may not be pension funds and unconsolidated
special purpose vehicles domiciled either in the U.S. or offshore for funding agreement-backed note programs. The funding agreements issued as part of these funding agreement-backed note programs work
by having investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose vehicle which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms similar to those of the debt obligations. The strength
of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to another. The special purpose vehicle issues the funding
agreement-backed notes to U.S. and foreign institutional investors.

Full Service Payout

Products

Full service payout products respond primarily to the needs of pension plan sponsors in the form of single premium group annuities, which are
immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. The majority of our business originates from defined benefit plans that are being
terminated. In these situations, the plan sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance
companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor has mandated that annuities be purchased only from the "safest available" insurers.

Since
premium received from full service payout products is generally in the form of single payments, the level of premiums can fluctuate depending on the number of large-scale annuity
sales in a particular quarter. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting full service payout account values.



Markets and Distribution

Our primary distribution channel for full service payout products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants working
through consultants and brokers that specialize in this type of business. Our sales consultants also make sales directly to institutions. Our nationally dispersed retirement services sales
representatives act as a secondary distribution channel for these products.

Banking Services

IRAs are provided by Principal Bank, primarily funded by retirement savings rolled over from qualified retirement plans. Principal Bank is a
federal savings bank that formed in February 1998. As of December 31, 2016, Principal Bank had nearly 348,000 customers and approximately $2.4 billion in assets. Principal Bank operates
under a limited purpose charter and may only accept deposits held in a fiduciary capacity, may not hold demand deposits or own commercial loans and cannot originate loans.

Products

The IRAs offered by Principal Bank provide Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC")-insured retirement solutions for its customers. The
IRAs are held in savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. The deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity for Principal Bank and are backed
by purchases of investment securities and residential mortgage loans.

Markets and Distribution

Principal Bank offers bank products and services to participants rolling out of qualified retirement plans primarily serviced by affiliates of
PFG. Principal Bank services customers through the telephone, mail and internet.

Principal Global Investors Segment

Our Principal Global Investors segment manages assets for sophisticated investors around the world, using a multi-boutique strategy that

U.S. Insurance Solutions Segment

Our U.S. Insurance Solutions segment offers group and individual insurance solutions. We focus on providing comprehensive insurance solutions
for small and medium-sized businesses and their owners and executives. We organize our operations into two divisions: Specialty Benefits Insurance and Individual Life Insurance. However, we share key
resources in our core areas such as strategic leadership, distribution and marketing.

Specialty Benefits Insurance

Specialty benefits insurance, which includes group dental, vision, life and disability insurance and individual disability insurance, is an
important component of the employee benefit offering at small and medium-sized businesses. We offer traditional employer sponsored and voluntary products for group dental, vision, life and disability.
We also offer group dental, vision and disability on a fee-for-service basis. Our individual disability insurance is also sold on an individual or multi-life basis.

Products and Services

Group Dental and Vision Insurance.

We began selling group dental and vision insurance in the late 1960s. Our plans provide
partial reimbursement for
dental and vision expenses. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 48,000 group dental and vision insurance policies in force covering nearly 1.3 million employee lives. According to Life
Insurance and Market Research Association ("LIMRA"), we were the 7th largest group dental insurer in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force in 2015. In addition to indemnity and
preferred provider organization dental offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis, we offer a prepaid dental plan in Arizona through our Employers Dental Services, Inc. subsidiary. We
also offer a discount dental product nationally. Our indemnity vision product and our managed care vision product are offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis.

Group Life Insurance.

Group life insurance was one of our first group products beginning in the early 1940s. Our group life
insurance provides
coverage to employees and their dependents for a specified period. As of December 31, 2016, we had nearly 57,000 group policies providing $140 billion of group life insurance in force to
approximately 2.3 million employee lives. According to LIMRA, in 2015 we were ranked 3rd in the U.S. in terms of the number of group life insurance contracts in force. We currently sell
traditional group life insurance that does not provide for accumulation of cash values on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. Our group life insurance business remains focused on the
traditional, annually renewable term product. Group term life and group universal life accounted for 98% and 2%, respectively, of our total group life insurance in force as of December 31,
2016. We no longer market group universal life insurance to new employer groups.

Group Disability Insurance.

Group disability insurance has also been sold since the early 1940s. Our group disability insurance
provides a benefit to
insured employees who become disabled. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. Our group disability products include both short-term and long-term disability, offered on
both an employer paid and voluntary basis. As of December 31, 2016, long-term disability represented 62% of total group disability premium, while short-term disability represented 38% of total
group disability premium. In addition, we provide disability management services, also called rehabilitation services, to assist individuals in returning to work as quickly as possible following
disability. We also work with disability claimants to improve the approval rate of Social Security benefits, thereby reducing payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received. As
of December 31, 2016, we served approximately 1.8 million employee lives through more than 43,000 contracts. According to LIMRA, our group short-term disability business was ranked
5th and our group long-term disability business was ranked 4th in the U.S. as of December 31, 2015, in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force. We also offer
voluntary critical illness insurance, which provides a lump-sum cash benefit to pay for additional expenses associated with the five most common critical illnesses.

Individual Disability Insurance.

Individual disability insurance has been sold since the early 1950s. Our individual disability
insurance products
provide income protection to the insured member and/or business in the event of disability. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. In addition to income replacement, we
offer products



to
pay business-related costs such as overhead expenses for a disabled business owner, buy-out costs for business owners purchasing a disabled owner's interest in the business, expenditures for
replacement of a key person and business loan payments. We also offer a product to protect retirement savings in the event of disability. As of December 31, 2016, we served approximately
184,000 individual disability policyholders. According to LIMRA, our individual disability business was ranked 5th in the U.S. in terms of premium in force in the non-cancellable segment of the
market and 5th overall, as of December 31, 2015.

Fee-for-Service.

We offer administration of group dental, disability and vision benefits on a fee-for-service basis.

Individual Life Insurance

We began as an individual life insurer in 1879 when we began selling traditional life insurance products to individuals. We now specialize in
providing solutions for small to medium-sized companies to protect against risk and loss, assist with succession planning and wealth transfer and to build and protect wealth for retirement. We also
provide solutions to meet the personal needs of business owners, executives and affluent individuals. Our U.S. operations administered approximately 588,000 individual life insurance policies with
over $295 billion of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2016.

Products and Services

Our Business Owner and Executive Solutions platform as well as our nonqualified deferred compensation offering combines administration and
consulting to service our clients' needs. We target the business and personal insurance needs of owners and executives of small and medium-sized businesses with an increasing focus on providing
insurance solutions for nonqualified executive benefits. In addition, we market our products to meet traditional retail insurance needs. We offer a variety of individual life insurance products,
including universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance and traditional life insurance.

Universal and Variable Universal Life Insurance.

Universal and variable universal life insurance products offer the policyholder
the option of
adjusting both the premium and the death benefit amounts of the insurance contract. Universal life insurance typically includes a cash value account that accumulates at a credited interest rate based
on the investment returns of the block of business. Variable universal life insurance is credited with the investment returns of the various investment options selected. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, 61% of individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales were generated from universal and variable universal life insurance products. Universal and variable
universal life insurance represented 29% of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2016.

After
a deduction for policy level expenses, we credit net deposits to an account maintained for the policyholder. For universal life contracts, the entire account balance is invested in
the general account. Interest is credited to the policyholder's account based on the earnings on general account investments, subject to contractual minimums. For variable universal life contracts,
the policyholder may allocate the account balance among our general account and a variety of mutual funds underlying the contract. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the general account in
the same manner as for universal life. Net investment performance on mutual funds is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts; the policyholder bears the investment risk. Some of our universal
life and variable universal life insurance contracts contain what are commonly referred to as "secondary" or "no-lapse" guarantee provisions. A no-lapse guarantee keeps the contract in force, even if
the contractholder's account balance is insufficient to cover all of the contract charges, provided that the contractholder has continually paid a specified minimum premium.

Traditional Life Insurance.

Traditional life insurance includes participating whole life, adjustable life products and
non-participating term life
insurance products. Participating products and non-participating term life insurance products represented 39% of our individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales for the year ended
December 31, 2016, and 71% of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2016. Adjustable life insurance products provide a guaranteed benefit in return for the payment of a
fixed premium and allow the policyholder to set the coverage period, premium and face amount combination. Term insurance products provide a guaranteed death benefit for a specified period of time in
return for the payment of a fixed premium. Policyholder dividends are not paid on term insurance.

U.S. Insurance Solutions Markets and Distribution

For each of our products, administration and distribution channels are customized to meet customer needs and expectations for that product.

We
market our group life, disability, dental and vision insurance products to small and medium-sized businesses, primarily targeting our sales toward owners and human resources
professionals. We sell our group life, disability, dental and vision products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We continually adapt our products and pricing to meet local market
conditions. We market our fee-for-service capabilities to employers that self-insure their employees' dental, disability and vision benefits. We market our fee-for-service businesses in all 50 states
and the District of Columbia.

The
group insurance market continues to see a shift to voluntary/worksite products due to various pressures on employers. In keeping with this market change, which shifts the funding of
such products from the employer to the employee, we continue to place an enhanced focus on our voluntary benefits platform. We believe the voluntary/worksite market presents growth opportunities and
we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.



As
of December 31, 2016, we had 130 sales representatives and 149 service representatives in 28 local markets. Our sales representatives accounted for 98% of our group insurance
sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The service representatives play a key role in servicing the case by providing local, responsive services to our customers and their brokers, such as
renewing contracts, revising plans, solving administrative issues and communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us.

We
sell our individual life and individual disability income products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, primarily targeting owners and executives of small and medium-sized
businesses. Small and medium-sized business sales represented 52% of individual life sales and 62% of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Much of our life
insurance sales efforts focus on the Business Owner and Executive Solutions market. This strategy offers solutions to address business owner financial challenges such as exiting the business, business
transition, retaining key employees and retirement planning. Key employees also have needs to supplement retirement income, survivor income, and business protection. We believe the Business Owner and
Executive Solutions segment offers growth opportunities and we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.

We
distribute our individual life and individual disability insurance products through our affiliated financial representatives and independent brokers, as well as other marketing and
distribution alliances. Affiliated financial representatives were responsible for 23% of individual life insurance sales based on first year annualized premium and 14% of individual disability sales
for the year ended December 31, 2016. We had 1,161 affiliated financial representatives in 33 offices as of December 31, 2016. Although they are independent contractors, we have a close
tie with affiliated financial representatives and we offer them benefits, training and access to tools and expertise. To meet the needs of the various marketing channels, particularly the independent
brokers, we employ wholesale distributors — Regional Vice Presidents for individual life and Regional Vice Presidents for individual disability. A key differentiator in the
nonqualified executive benefit sale is our Regional Vice Presidents-Nonqualified Plans, who are not only wholesalers but also consultants and subject-matter experts providing point-of-sale support in
closing cases.

Corporate Segment

During fourth quarter 2016, we decided to move long-term care, a business we exited and fully reinsured in 1997, from the U.S. Insurance
Solutions segment to the Corporate segment to align it with the management of other exited businesses in the Corporate segment. This change has been applied retrospectively to our segment financial
information but did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Our
Corporate segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate segment primarily reflect our financing
activities (including financing costs and preferred stock dividends), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and
other adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. Results of Principal Securities, Inc., our retail broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, and our
exited group medical and long-term care insurance businesses are reported in this segment.

Competition

Competition in our segments is based on a number of factors including: scale, service, product features, price, investment performance,
commission structure, distribution capacity, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, mutual funds,
broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, greater diversity of distribution sources, better brand recognition
or, with respect to insurers, higher financial strength ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete or may have better investment performance at various times. We
believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our:

•

full service platform;

•

strong customer relationships;

•

focus on investment performance and

•

expansive product portfolio.

Ratings

Insurance companies are assigned financial strength ratings by rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders. Financial strength
ratings are generally defined as opinions as to an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Information about ratings provides both industry participants
and insurance consumers meaningful insights on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims.



Principal
Life and Principal National Life Insurance Company ("PNLIC") have been assigned the following insurer financial strength ratings:

Rating Agency

Financial Strength Rating

Rating Structure

A.M. Best Company, Inc.

A+ ("Superior") with a stable outlook

Second highest of 13 rating levels

Fitch Ratings Ltd.

AA- ("Very Strong") with a stable outlook

Fourth highest of 19 rating levels

Moody's Investors Service

A1 ("Good") with a stable outlook

Fifth highest of 21 rating levels

S&P Global

A+ ("Strong") with a stable outlook

Fifth highest of 20 rating levels

A.M.
Best's ratings for insurance companies range from "A++" to "S". A.M. Best indicates that "A++" and "A+" ratings are assigned to those companies that in A.M. Best's
opinion have superior ability to meet ongoing insurance obligations. Fitch's ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "C". Fitch "AA" ratings indicate very strong capacity to meet
policyholder and contract obligations. Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") ratings for insurance companies range from "Aaa" to "C". Moody's indicates that "A" ratings are assigned to those companies
that offer good financial security. S&P Global's ("S&P") ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "NR". S&P indicates that "A" ratings are assigned to those companies that have strong
financial security characteristics. In evaluating a company's financial and operating performance, these rating agencies review its profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of
business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its assets, the adequacy of its policy reserves, the soundness of its risk management programs, the
experience and competency of its management and other factors.

A.M.
Best, Moody's and Fitch have all changed their outlook on the U.S. life insurance sector to 'negative' from 'stable' in 2016. Continued low interest rates, an uncertain regulatory
environment, exposure to asset management and international risks and low domestic growth are pressuring the sector.

S&P
is the only rating agency to maintain a 'stable' outlook on the U.S. life insurance sector. S&P's view is that continued low interest rates will pressure insurers' bottom lines, but
strong capitalization will offset the credit quality impact.

We
believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to our distributors and customers, as ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used
throughout the industry. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations
directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security, including our common stock. For more information on
ratings, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financial
Strength and Credit Ratings."

Regulation

Our businesses are subject to regulation and supervision by U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities as well as non-U.S. regulatory
authorities for our operations outside the U.S., which can have a significant effect on our business. Our businesses are also affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws as well as tax laws for
jurisdictions outside the U.S.

PFG,
our parent holding company, is not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor, broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it is the holding company for all of
our operations, it is subject to regulation of our regulated entities, including as an insurance holding company. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to public companies,
including public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting and corporate governance.

U.S. Insurance Regulation

We are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance companies are domiciled. Principal Life and PNLIC are
domiciled in Iowa and their principal insurance regulatory authority is the Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally
regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register
with the insurance department in the insurance company's state of domicile and to furnish financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company system.
Transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and at arm's length. Most states have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change in
control of an insurer or an insurer's holding company and laws that require prior notification of state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing
business in that state.

Annually,
our U.S. insurance companies must submit an opinion from a board-appointed qualified actuary to state insurance regulators, where licensed, on whether the statutory assets held
backing statutory reserves are sufficient to meet contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be rendered noting the sufficiency of assets, the insurance
company must set up additional statutory reserves drawing from available statutory surplus until such an opinion can be given.



State insurance departments have broad administrative powers over the insurance business, including insurance company licensing and examination, agent licensing,
establishment of reserve requirements and solvency standards, premium rate regulation, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, policy form approval, unfair trade and claims practices regulation and
other matters. State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent
companies. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further details.

In
order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has established risk-based capital standards. The standards require
life insurers to submit a report to state regulators on an annual basis regarding their risk-based capital based upon four categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and
business risk. As of December 31, 2016, the statutory surplus of each of our U.S. life insurance companies exceeded the minimum risk-based capital requirements.

State
and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or
investigations regarding our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws and securities laws.

Each
state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover contractual benefit
obligations of insolvent insurance companies. The guaranty associations levy assessments on each member insurer in a jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by
such insurer in the lines of business in which the insolvent insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit the member insurers to recover the assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
offsets.

Securities Regulation

Insurance and investment products such as variable annuities, variable life insurance and some funding agreements that constitute securities and
mutual fund products are subject to securities laws and regulations, including state securities regulation as well as federal regulation under the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and
other regulatory authorities. These regulations affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products.

We
also have entities that are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act

As we provide products and services for U.S. employee benefit plans, we are subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act ("ERISA"). ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure requirements and standards of conduct.

Banking Regulation

Principal Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a federal savings bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Principal
Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC, making the Bank subject to certain of the FDIC's regulations.

Environmental Regulation

As we own and operate real property, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and could be subject to environmental
liabilities and costs associated with required remediation of our properties. We routinely have environmental assessments performed for real estate being acquired or used as collateral for commercial
mortgages we use for investment.

Regulation of International Businesses

Our international businesses are supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

Risk Management

Like all financial services companies, we are exposed to a wide variety of financial, operational and other risks, as described in
Item 1A. "Risk Factors." Effective enterprise risk management is, therefore, a key component of our business model.

Enterprise
risk management helps us to manage risk to meet our customer obligations, satisfy regulatory requirements, adequately provide for contingencies in case of stress, optimize
shareholder returns, support our core values and maintain our reputation.

We
utilize an integrated risk management framework to help us identify, assess, monitor, report, manage and aggregate our material risks within established risk appetites and risk
tolerances. The framework delivers important perspective that is used in strategic and tactical decision making and is adaptable to changes in our businesses and in the



external
environments in which we operate. Our approach also requires a commitment to continuous improvement and periodic validation.

Our
governance structure includes Board of Directors oversight, internal risk committees, a corporate risk management function and embedded risk professionals in our business units and
functional areas. Our Board of
Directors, Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Human Resource Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee provide oversight no less frequently than quarterly, addressing relevant aspects of our
risk profile.

Our
internal risk committees meet on a regular and frequent basis to discuss various issues and review profile status. Each business unit and key functional area has its own committee
that is responsible for oversight of the material risks within the unit or area. These committees may include corporate leaders. We also have internal committees that provide oversight around a
certain risk or group of related risks across the organization. This matrix approach helps us maintain comprehensive risk coverage and preserve an integrated view of risks. The Enterprise Risk
Management Committee, comprised of members from the executive management team, exercises enterprise-wide oversight for our most significant risk profiles.

The
business units and functional areas are responsible for identifying, assessing, monitoring, reporting and managing their own risks. Chief Risk Officers embedded within each business
unit or risk professionals in functional areas help align risk management practice with the strategies of the unit as well as with enterprise-wide objectives. The Corporate Chief Risk Officer and
supporting staff are separate from the business units and provide objective oversight, framework enablement and aggregated risk analysis. Internal Audit provides independent assurance around effective
risk management design and control execution.

Risk
appetites, tolerances and limits have been established from an enterprise-wide and business unit perspective for specific risk categories, where appropriate. We monitor a variety of
risk metrics on an ongoing basis and take the appropriate steps to manage our established risk appetites and tolerances. Quarterly risk reporting provides a feedback loop between business units,
functional areas, our internal risk committees and the corporate risk management function. This reporting also includes perspectives on emerging risk. To the extent potentially significant business
activities or operational initiatives are considered, analysis of the possible impact on our risk profile takes place. This analysis includes, but is not limited to, the capital implications; the
impact on near term and long-term earnings; the ability to meet our targets with respect to return on equity, liquidity, debt/capital, cash coverage, business risk and operational risk; and the impact
to our reputation.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had 14,854 employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements except a group of
employees within our Cuprum organization in Chile. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.

Internet Website

Our internet website can be found at www.principal.com. We make available free of charge, on or through our internet website, access to our
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC. Also available free of charge on our internet website is our
code of business conduct and ethics, corporate governance guidelines and charters for the Audit, Finance, Human Resources and Nominating and Governance committees of our Board of Directors. Also see
Item 10. "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance."

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

This section provides an overview of the risks that may impact our performance in the future.

Risks relating to economic conditions, market conditions and investments

Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, as
well as our access to capital and cost of capital.

Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by volatility,
uncertainty and disruption in the capital and credit markets.

We
maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is believed adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term
benefit and expense payment obligations. However, withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, such as changes in economic conditions or changes in our
claims paying ability and financial strength ratings. For additional information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk and the impact of a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, see
"— Changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a sustained low interest rate environment may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and
our net income can vary from period to period" and "— A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, reduce new sales



and
terminate relationships with distributors, impact existing liabilities and increase our cost of capital, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition." In
addition, mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative instruments may lead to fluctuations in our reported statutory capital. These fluctuations may result in the need for additional capital to
maintain a targeted level of statutory capital relative to the NAIC's risk-based capital requirements. In the event our current internal sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to
seek additional financing and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The availability of additional financing will depend on a
variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit
ratings and credit capacity, as well as customers' or lenders' perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or
rating agencies take negative actions against us.

Disruptions,
uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business, most significantly our insurance operations.
Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital requirements; fund redemption requests on insurance or other financial
products; generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue
shorter tenor securities than we prefer, utilize available internal resources or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial
flexibility and liquidity.

In
addition, we maintain credit facilities with various financial institutions as a potential source of excess liquidity. These facilities are in place to bridge timing in cash flows to
minimize the cost of meeting our obligations, particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are limited. Our ability to borrow funds under these facilities is conditioned on our
satisfaction of covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities. Our failure to comply with these covenants, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments, would restrict
our ability to access these credit facilities and, consequently, could limit our flexibility in meeting our cash flow needs.

For
further discussion on liquidity risk management, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially and adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and
elsewhere around the world. Adverse economic conditions may result in a decline in our AUM and revenues and erosion of our profit margins. In addition, in the event of extreme prolonged market events
and economic downturns, we could incur significant losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.

Factors
such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, investor and consumer confidence, foreign currency
exchange rates and inflation levels all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher
unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment, negative investor sentiment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products
could be adversely affected. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or
stop paying insurance premiums altogether. In addition, reductions in employment levels of our existing employer customers may result in a reduction in membership levels and premium income for our
specialty benefits products. Participants within the retirement plans for which we provide administrative services may elect to reduce or stop their payroll deferrals to these plans, which would
reduce AUM and revenues. In addition, reductions in employment levels may result in a decline in employee deposits into retirement plans. Adverse changes in the economy could affect net income
negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

An
economic downturn may also lead to weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which would adversely affect the translation of segment pre-tax operating earnings and
equity of our international operations into our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on foreign currency exchange risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk."

Volatility or declines in the equity, bond or real estate markets could reduce our AUM and may result in
investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rates of investment, all of which could reduce our revenues and net income.

Because the revenues of our asset management and accumulation businesses are, to a large extent, based on the value of AUM, a decline in
domestic and global equity, bond or real estate markets will decrease our revenues. Turmoil in these markets could lead investors to withdraw from these markets, decrease their rates of investment or
refrain from making new investments, which may reduce our net income, revenues and AUM. As we continue to shift toward a more fee-based business model, our revenues and net income may become more
sensitive to fluctuations in the equity, bond, and real estate markets.



For
further discussion on equity risk management, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Equity Risk."

Changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a sustained low interest rate environment may adversely affect
our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net income can vary from period to period.

In recent years, interest rates have remained at or near historically low levels. During periods of declining interest rates or sustained low
interest rates, the interest rates we earn on our assets may be lower than the rates assumed in pricing our products, thereby reducing our profitability. For some of our products, such as GICs and
funding agreements, we are unable to lower the rate we credit to customers in response to the lower return we will earn on our investments. In addition, guaranteed minimum interest rates on our life
insurance and annuity products may constrain our ability to lower the rate we credit to customers. If interest rates remain low over a sustained period of time, this may result in increases in our
reserves and true-ups or unlocking of our deferred acquisition cost ("DAC") asset and other actuarial balances. During periods of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay or redeem mortgages and
bonds that we own, which would force us to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates. Furthermore, declining interest rates may reduce the rate of policyholder surrenders and withdrawals on our
life insurance and annuity products, thus increasing the duration of the liabilities and creating asset and liability duration mismatches. Low interest rates may also increase the cost of hedging our
GMWB rider. Declining interest rates or a sustained low interest rate environment may also result in changes to the discount rate used for valuing our pension and other postretirement benefit ("OPEB")
obligations, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, certain statutory capital and reserve requirements are based on formulas or models that
consider interest rates and a prolonged period of low interest rates may increase the statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory
reserves.

Increases
in market interest rates may also adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. During periods of increasing market interest rates, we may
offer higher crediting rates on our insurance and annuity products in order to keep these products competitive. Because returns on our portfolio of invested assets may not increase as quickly as
current interest rates, we may have to accept lower spreads, thus reducing our profitability. Rapidly rising interest rates may also result in an increase in policy surrenders, withdrawals and
requests for policy loans as customers seek to achieve higher returns. In addition, rising interest rates would cause a decrease in the value of financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated
statements of financial position. Despite our efforts to reduce the impact of rising interest rates, we may be required to sell assets to raise the cash necessary to respond to an increase in
surrenders, withdrawals and loans, thereby realizing capital losses on the assets sold. An increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals may also require us to accelerate amortization of our DAC asset
relating to these products, which would further reduce our profitability. Rising interest rates may also cause a decline in the value of
the fixed income assets we manage, resulting in a reduction in our fee revenue in the short term. In addition, a significant increase in interest rates may cause a reduction in the fair value of
intangible assets in our reporting units, potentially leading to an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.

For
discussion about interest rate risk management, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk."

Our
exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price variability and reinvestment risk associated with changes in credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads would cause
unrealized losses in our investment portfolio, would increase losses associated with credit-based derivatives we have sold that do not qualify or have not been designated for hedge accounting where we
assume credit exposure and, if issuer credit spreads increase as a result of fundamental credit deterioration, would likely result in higher other-than-temporary impairments. Credit spread tightening
will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities. Credit spread tightening may also cause an increase in the reported value of certain liabilities that are valued
using a discount rate that reflects our own credit spread. In addition, market volatility may make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations
may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period-to-period changes from market volatility, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and
the investment returns credited to customers, which could reduce our sales, revenues, AUM and net income.

An increase in defaults or write-downs on our fixed maturities portfolio may reduce our profitability.

We are subject to the risk that the issuers of the fixed maturities we own will default on principal and interest payments. As of
December 31, 2016, our U.S. investment operations held $51.6 billion of fixed maturities, or 75% of total U.S. invested assets, of which approximately 7% were below investment grade,
including $228.9 million, or 0.44% of our total fixed maturities that we classified as either "problem," "potential problem" or "restructured." See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — U.S. Investment Operations — Fixed Maturities."

Approximately
$1.1 billion of our U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities are scheduled to mature in 2017. We may be exposed to losses if borrowers in the underlying mortgages
are unable to repay their loans at the time of maturity. Several mitigating factors have resulted in strong refinancing rates in 2014-2016. These factors include low interest rates,



improving
real estate fundamentals, and the availability of capital from the new issues and high yield debt markets. However, refinancing risks could increase over the next year if we experience high
interest rates that are not
supported by commensurate economic growth or a slowdown in the economy that results in lower income growth and a decline in property values.

As
of December 31, 2016, the international investment operations of our fully consolidated subsidiaries held $3.7 billion of fixed maturities, or 52%, of total
international invested assets, of which 13% are government bonds. Some non-government bonds have been rated on the basis of the issuer's country credit rating. However, the ratings relationship
between national ratings and global ratings is not linear with the U.S. The starting point for national ratings differs by country, which makes the assessment of credit quality more difficult. See
Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — International Investment Operations." An
increase in defaults on our fixed maturities portfolio could harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.

An increased rate of delinquency and defaults on our commercial mortgage loans, including balloon maturities with and without amortizing payments, may adversely affect our
profitability.

Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio faces both delinquency and default risk. Commercial mortgage loans of $12.0 billion represented
16% of our total invested assets as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, there were no loans in the process of foreclosure in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. The
performance of our commercial mortgage loan investments, however, may fluctuate in the future. An increase in the delinquency rate of, and defaults under, our commercial mortgage loan portfolio could
harm our financial strength and decrease our profitability.

As
of December 31, 2016, approximately $9.9 billion, or 82%, of our U.S. investment operations commercial mortgage loans before valuation allowance had balloon payment
maturities. A balloon maturity is a loan with all or a meaningful portion of the loan amount due at the maturity of the loan. The default rate on commercial mortgage loans with balloon payment
maturities has historically been higher than for commercial mortgage loans with a fully amortizing loan structure. Since a significant portion of the principal is repaid at maturity, the amount of
loss on a default is generally greater than fully amortizing commercial mortgage loans. An increase in defaults on balloon maturity loans as a result of the foregoing factors could harm our financial
strength and decrease our profitability.

Mark-to-market adjustments on certain equity method investments and trading securities may reduce our profitability or cause volatility in our reported earnings.

Our investment portfolio includes certain equity method investments and trading securities that are reported at fair value on the consolidated
statements of financial position, with changes in fair value reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Mark-to-market adjustments on these investments may reduce
our profitability or cause our net income to vary from period to period. We anticipate that acquisition and investment activities may increase the number and magnitude of these investments in the
future.

We may have difficulty selling our privately placed fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments because they are less liquid than our publicly traded
fixed maturities.

We hold certain investments that may be less liquid, such as privately placed fixed maturities, mortgage loans and real estate investments.
These asset classes represented approximately 40% of the value of our invested assets as of December 31, 2016.

If
we require significant amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would
have been able to realize or both. The reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments, our investments in the asset classes described above and, at times, our high quality, generally
liquid asset classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest possible price for the asset. If we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market, there can be no assurance we will be
able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.

The impairment of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.

We use derivative instruments to hedge various risks we face in our businesses. See Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk." We enter into a variety of derivative instruments with a number of counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment
banks, clearinghouses, exchanges and other institutions. For transactions where we are in-the-money, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. We establish collateral
agreements with nominal thresholds for a large majority of our counterparties to limit our exposure. However, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is
liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. With regard to our derivative exposure, we have over-collateralization requirements on the portion of
collateral we hold, based on the risk profile of the assets posted as collateral. We also have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments and equity
investments. Such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.



Our requirements to post collateral or make payments related to declines in market value of specified assets may adversely affect our liquidity and expose us to counterparty credit
risk.

Many of our derivative transactions with financial and other institutions specify the circumstances under which the parties are required to post
collateral. The amount of collateral we may be required to post under these agreements may increase under certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, under the
terms of some of our transactions we may be required to make payment to our counterparties related to any decline in the market value of the specified assets. Such payments could have an adverse
effect on our liquidity. Furthermore, with respect to any such payments, we will have unsecured risk to the counterparty as these amounts are not required to be segregated from the counterparty's
other funds, are not held in a third party custodial account, and are not required to be paid to us by the counterparty until the termination of the transaction.

Environmental liability exposure may result from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments.

Liability under environmental protection laws resulting from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments may harm our
financial strength and reduce our profitability. Under the laws of several states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of cleanup. In
some states, this kind of lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property, which would impair our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in
default. In addition, under the laws of some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, we may be liable for costs of addressing
releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that require remedy at a property securing a mortgage loan held by us, if our agents or employees have become sufficiently involved in the
hazardous waste aspects of the operations of the related obligor on that loan, regardless of whether or not the environmental damage or threat was caused by the obligor. We also may face this
liability after foreclosing on a property securing a mortgage loan held by us. This may harm our financial strength and decrease our profitability.

Regional concentration of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio in California may subject us to losses attributable to economic downturns or catastrophes in that state.

Commercial mortgage lending in the state of California accounted for 18%, or $2.2 billion, of our U.S. investment operations commercial
mortgage loan portfolio before valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016. Due to this concentration of commercial mortgage loans in California, we are exposed to potential losses resulting
from the risk of an economic downturn in California as well as to catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may affect the region. While we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties
on which we make commercial mortgage loans, we do take into account property specific engineering reports, construction type and geographical concentration by fault lines in our investment
underwriting guidelines. If economic conditions in California deteriorate or catastrophes occur, we may in the future experience delinquencies or defaults on the portion of our commercial mortgage
loan portfolio located in California, which may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.

Gross unrealized losses may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.

Fixed maturities that are classified as available-for-sale ("AFS") are reported on the consolidated statements of financial position at fair
value. Unrealized gains or losses on AFS securities are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and are, therefore, excluded from net income. Our U.S. investment
operations had gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities of $0.6 billion pre-tax as of December 31, 2016, and the component of gross unrealized losses for securities trading down 20%
or more for over six months was approximately $0.1 billion pre-tax. The accumulated change in fair value of the AFS securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon
the sale of the asset or in the event that the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary (referred to as an other-than-temporary impairment). Realized losses or impairments may
have a material adverse impact on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.

Principal International sells products denominated in various local currencies and generally invests the associated assets in local currencies.
For diversification purposes, assets backing the products may be partially invested in non-local currencies. In our U.S. operations, we also issue foreign currency-denominated funding agreements to
nonqualified investors in the institutional market or invest in foreign currency-denominated investments. The associated foreign currency exchange risk in each instance is hedged or managed to
specific risk tolerances. Although our investment and hedging strategies limit the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on operating results, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation
of the results of our international operations into our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on foreign currency exchange risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk."



Risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuations

Our valuation of investments and the determinations of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our
investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or
financial condition.

Fixed maturities, equity securities and derivatives represent the majority of total cash and invested assets reported at fair value on our
consolidated statements of financial position, excluding separate accounts. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Fair value estimates are made based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument at a
specific point in time. Considerable judgment is often required to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts.

For
additional information on our valuation methodology, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Fair
Value Measurements."

During
periods of market disruption including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain
securities, for example collateralized mortgage obligations and collateralized debt obligations, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset
classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, the valuation process may require more subjectivity
and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that require greater estimation,
which could
result in values that are different from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation
of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition.

The
determination of the amount of allowances and impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with
the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments require significant judgment and are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Additional impairments may need to
be taken or allowances provided for in the future, and the ultimate loss may exceed management's current estimate of impairment amounts.

Additionally,
our management considers a wide range of factors about the instrument issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value
of the instrument and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management's evaluation of the instrument are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
earnings potential. For further information regarding our impairment and allowance methodologies, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Investments — U.S. Investment Operations" under the captions "Fixed Maturities" and "Mortgage Loans" and Item 7. "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Valuation and Impairment of Fixed Income Investments."

Any impairments of or valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results
of operations and financial condition.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. We are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each
quarter and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realizable. In determining the need for a valuation
allowance, we consider many factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable
income in prior carryback years and implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies management would employ to realize the tax benefit.

Inherent
in the provision for income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items, the timing of income and expense recognition and the current or future realization
of operating losses, capital losses, certain tax credits and future enacted changes in applicable tax rates as well as the tax base. In the event these estimates differ from our prior estimates due to
the receipt of new information, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Any such change could significantly affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these estimates change. A further significant decline in value of assets incorporated into our tax planning strategies could
lead to an increase of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets having an adverse effect on current and future results.

For
additional information, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates — Income Taxes."



We may face losses if our actual experience differs significantly from our pricing and reserving assumptions.

Our profitability depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with the assumptions used in setting prices
for our products and establishing liabilities for future insurance and annuity policy benefits and claims. The premiums we charge and the liabilities we hold for future policy benefits are based on
assumptions reflecting a number of factors, including the amount of premiums we will receive in the future, rate of return on assets we purchase with premiums received, expected claims, mortality,
morbidity, lapse rates and expenses. However, due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liabilities for unpaid policy
benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts we will ultimately pay to settle these liabilities. As a result, we may experience volatility in the level of our profitability and our
reserves from period to period. To the extent that actual experience is less favorable than our underlying assumptions, we could be required to increase our liabilities, which may harm our financial
strength and reduce our profitability.

For
example, if mortality or morbidity rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we may be required to make greater claims payments on our insurance policies sooner than we had
projected. However, this risk may be partially offset by our use of third party reinsurance. In addition, the mortality risk on our life insurance business may be partially offset by our payout
annuity business, where an increase in mortality rates will result in a decrease in benefit payments. Concentrations of risk, by both geography and industry, may cause mortality or morbidity rates in
our group insurance businesses or individual disability insurance to be higher than anticipated.

Our
results of operations may also be adversely impacted if our actual investment earnings differ from our pricing and reserve assumptions. Changes in economic conditions may lead to
changes in market interest rates or changes in our investment strategies, either of which could cause our actual investment earnings to differ from our pricing and reserve assumptions.

For
additional information on our insurance reserves, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Insurance Reserves."

The pattern of amortizing our DAC asset and other actuarial balances on our universal life-type insurance
contracts, participating life insurance policies and certain investment contracts may change, impacting both the level of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances and the timing of our net income.

Amortization of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances depends on the actual and expected profits generated by the lines of business that
incurred the expenses. Expected profits are dependent on assumptions regarding a number of factors including investment returns, benefit payments, expenses, mortality and policy lapse. Due to the
uncertainty associated with establishing these assumptions, we cannot, with precision, determine the exact pattern of profit emergence. As a result, amortization of these balances will vary from
period to period. To the extent actual experience emerges less favorably than expected or our expectation for future profits decreases, our DAC asset and other actuarial balances may be adjusted,
reducing our profitability in the current period.

For
additional information, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates — Deferred Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances."

Legal, regulatory and tax risks

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.

We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual
property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to
enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be
significant in amount and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a
material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.

We
also may be subject to costly litigation in the event another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon such other party's intellectual property rights. Third parties
may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services or could otherwise limit our ability to offer certain
product features. Any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, license usage
rights, or misappropriation of trade secret rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or
misappropriated a third party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or
services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly
licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Our ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet our obligations may be constrained by the limitations on
dividends Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life.

We are an insurance holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Principal Life and other
subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and any debt service, depends upon the receipt of dividends from Principal
Life. Iowa insurance laws impose limitations on the ability of Principal Life to pay dividends to us. Any inability of Principal Life to pay dividends to us in the future may cause us to be unable to
pay dividends to our stockholders and meet our other obligations. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on Principal Life's ability to pay us dividends.

Changes in laws or regulations may reduce our profitability.

Our insurance business is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision throughout the U.S. and in the international markets in which we
operate. We are also impacted by federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as securities laws, employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulations and federal and
international taxation. Changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof could significantly increase our compliance costs and reduce our profitability. Failure to comply with applicable
regulations may expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage. The results of the recent U.S. presidential and congressional elections may increase the chance of federal legislative and
regulatory changes that could have an unknown impact on the various types of regulation discussed below.

Changes in insurance regulations may reduce our profitability.

The primary purpose of insurance regulation is to protect policyholders, not stockholders. In the U.S., the laws of the various states establish
insurance departments with broad powers to regulate such matters as:

•

licensing companies to transact business,

•

licensing agents,

•

prescribing allowable practices for illustrating policies,

•

admitting statutory assets,

•

mandating a number of insurance benefits,

•

regulating premium rates,

•

approving policy forms,

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices,

•

establishing statutory reserve requirements and solvency standards,

•

regulating insurer use of affiliated reinsurance companies,

•

fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values,

•

restricting various transactions between affiliates and

•

regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.

State
insurance regulators, federal regulators and the NAIC continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, and may impose changes in the future. New interpretations of existing
laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies, increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously and adversely affect our profitability and financial
strength.

State
insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities we have established for these potential assessments may not be adequate. In addition,
regulators may change their interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations.

The
NAIC regularly reviews and updates its statutory reserve and risk-based capital requirements. Changes to these requirements may increase the amount of reserves and capital our U.S.
insurance companies are required to hold and may adversely impact Principal Life's ability to pay dividends to us. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a
discussion of regulatory restrictions on Principal Life's ability to pay us dividends. In addition, changes in statutory reserve or risk-based capital requirements may adversely impact our financial
strength ratings. See the risk factor entitled "A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, reduce new sales and terminate relationships
with distributors, impact existing liabilities and increase our cost of capital, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition" for a discussion of risks relating to
our financial strength ratings.



State
regulators are implementing a principles-based reserving ("PBR") approach for life insurance and non-variable annuity products. The PBR framework for individual life insurance will
become effective beginning in 2017 and can be adopted by companies for new business at any time during a permitted three year transition period. The effective date for the group and individual annuity
PBR framework is not yet known, but portions could be effective as soon as 2018. Under the PBR framework, statutory reserves would reflect a combination of company experience and prescribed
assumptions and methodologies. The ultimate financial impact of the PBR framework on new business is uncertain, but it could result in higher reserves, more volatile reserves and uncertain tax
treatment.

We
have implemented reinsurance transactions utilizing affiliated reinsurers and highly rated third parties to finance a portion of the reserves for our term life insurance policies and
universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. Our ability to enter into new reserve financing transactions will continue to be dependent on the cost and forms of financing available in
the market and our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals. Once life insurance PBR becomes fully effective, there may no longer be any financial advantage to pursuing the use of these
affiliate reinsurance transactions for new business. For additional information regarding our use of affiliated reinsurance transactions, see Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Statutory Insurance Financial Information."

The
NAIC is working on updates to its statutory framework for variable annuities, which includes statutory reserve, capital and derivative accounting requirements. While the details of
and financial impacts from these reforms are uncertain, the changes could negatively impact our profitability and capital position or create additional volatility. The NAIC could implement these
reforms effective as early as 2017. In addition, the New York Department of Financial Services is considering a revision to the separate account regulations of its state. The status of these revisions
is very uncertain, but if adopted, these revisions could negatively impact the ability of New York licensed insurers to issue competitive variable annuity products nationally.

The
NAIC is pursuing a variety of reforms to its risk-based capital ("RBC") framework:

•

One proposal includes a new component for operational risk that could be effective as early as 2017. The operational risk component could
increase our RBC requirements; however, the magnitude of the increase is not yet known.

•

The NAIC is pursuing an update to the RBC credit risk factors for fixed income investments. This update is expected to increase the capital
requirements for bonds. Another possible update may lead to a favorable reduction in factors for real estate investments. The net impact is unknown, but could be a modest increase to our capital
requirements in total. The credit risk factor revisions could be effective as early as 2017.

•

The NAIC is exploring development of a new charge for longevity risk. Such a charge could increase our capital requirements. The longevity risk
charge could be effective as early as 2017.

•

The NAIC is developing a group-wide capital calculation. This calculation is not intended to be a regulatory capital requirement, but it could
be used by regulators in their supervisory process. The calculation could be required as soon as 2017.

Our
international insurance businesses are also subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision from central and/or local governmental authorities in each country in which we
operate. New interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations may harm our international businesses and reduce our profitability in those businesses.
Changes to capital requirements are currently included in a draft proposal in Chile. In addition, Brazil has adopted new capital requirements that will become effective at the end of 2017.

The
International Association of Insurance Supervisors ("IAIS") has proposed a common framework for the supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups ("IAIGs"), which is
scheduled to be ready for implementation within the various countries starting in 2019. Under the proposed framework, IAIGs would be supervised on a group-wide basis under a set of enhanced
supervisory standards. Under this framework, the IAIS is also developing a group-wide Insurance Capital Standard ("ICS"), which would apply to IAIGs. For systemic risk management, the Financial
Stability Board is continuing to implement group supervisory and capital requirements for Global Systemically Important Insurers ("G-SIIs"). We currently are not designated as an IAIG or a G-SII. If
we were so designated in the future, we may be subject to supervision and capital requirements beyond those applicable to any competitors without those designations. These international frameworks may
influence the regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate, potentially leading to an increase in our capital requirements.

Changes in federal, state and foreign securities laws may reduce our profitability.

Our asset management and accumulation and life insurance businesses are subject to various levels of regulation under federal, state and foreign
securities laws. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory or brokerage clients and generally grant supervisory agencies
broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. Changes to these laws or regulations, or the
interpretation thereof, that restrict the conduct of our business could significantly increase our compliance costs and reduce our profitability.



Changes in employee benefit regulations may reduce our profitability.

We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in ERISA to permit application of state law remedies, such as consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for
wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. In addition, reductions in contribution levels to defined contribution plans may decrease
our profitability.

In
April 2016, the Department of Labor ("DOL") released its final fiduciary definition regulation package. The regulation broadens the definition of a fiduciary under
ERISA to include persons providing investment advice to an employee benefit plan or an IRA for a fee or other compensation. The DOL also released two new prohibited transaction class exemptions and
amendments to current prohibited transaction exemptions. Broker-dealers and advisors are in various stages of determining the implications of the regulations on their business models. How they proceed
could impact our business. Even with this fluid environment, our preliminary assessment of the new regulation's impact to our business and future financial results indicates the costs will not have a
significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As the rules become applicable and are operationalized, we will assess what business impacts need to be addressed and how they
affect the organization.

Financial services regulatory reform may reduce our profitability, impact how we do business or limit our ability to engage in certain capital expenditures.

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law. The Dodd-Frank Act makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services
firms and requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementation rules and regulations, including regulations surrounding the use of derivatives. The federal agencies were
given significant discretion in drafting the implementation rules and regulations, and consequently, some of the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act are not fully known yet. It is likely that new margining
aspects of the law will increase hedging costs for the company and possibly cause fundamental shifts to the way risks are hedged.

Changes in tax laws could increase our tax costs and reduce sales of our insurance, annuity and investment products.

Current federal income tax laws generally permit the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by the holders of annuities and
life insurance products. Taxes, if any, are payable on income attributable to a distribution under the contract for the year in which the distribution is made. The U.S. Congress has, from time to
time, considered legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of such deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within life insurance and nonqualified annuity contracts. Enactment of
this legislation, including a simplified income tax structure, could result in fewer sales of our insurance, annuity and investment products. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could
negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning.

In
addition, we benefit from certain tax items, including but not limited to, dividends received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), tax-exempt bond interest and
insurance reserve deductions. From time to time, the U.S. Congress, as well as foreign, state and local governments, consider legislative changes that could reduce or eliminate the benefits associated
with these and other tax items. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has released proposed policy around Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. As such legislation is adopted by
participating countries, our profitability could be negatively impacted. We continue to evaluate the impact potential tax reform proposals, which currently lack sufficient detail, may have on our
future results of operations and financial condition.

Changes in accounting standards may reduce the transparency of our reported profitability and financial
condition.

Accounting standards are subject to change and can reduce the transparency of our reported profitability. See Item 8, "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies". The Financial Accounting Standards Board is
currently working on several key projects. These projects could result in significant changes to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), including the accounting standards
for insurance contracts. There is still some uncertainty surrounding the effective dates and transition methods for the proposed changes. If adopted, the proposed changes in accounting standards could
have the potential to negatively impact our reported profitability and financial ratios and may make it more difficult for investors and regulators to accurately assess our financial condition and
profitability. In addition, the required adoption of new accounting standards may result in significant incremental costs associated with initial implementation and ongoing compliance.

Results of litigation and regulatory investigations may affect our financial strength or reduce our
profitability.

We are regularly involved in litigation, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff, but primarily as a defendant. Litigation naming us as a
defendant ordinarily arises out of our business operations as a provider of asset management and accumulation products and services; life and disability insurance; and our investment activities. We
are, from time to time, also involved in various governmental, regulatory and administrative proceedings and inquiries.

These
factors may affect our financial strength or reduce our profitability. For further discussion on litigation and regulatory investigation risk, see Item 3. "Legal
Proceedings," Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,



Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12, Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications" under the caption, "Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies" and Item 8. "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10, Income Taxes" under the caption "Other Tax Information."

From time to time we may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result
we may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States as well as many other jurisdictions. In determining our provisions for income taxes and our
accounting for tax-related matters in general, we are required to exercise judgment. We regularly make estimates where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The final
determination of any tax audit, appeal of the decision of a taxing authority, tax litigation or similar proceedings may be materially different from that reflected in our historical financial
statements. The assessment of additional taxes, interest and penalties could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.

Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business
combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests.

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent, or render more difficult a takeover attempt that some
stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a
bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as
discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

State
laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management
entrenchment, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.

The
following provisions, included in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that some
stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:

•

permit our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;

•

divide our Board of Directors into three classes;

•

limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors;

•

prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on our Board of Directors;

•

prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;

•

impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings and

•

require the approval of at least 75% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock for the amendment of our by-laws and provisions of our
certificate of incorporation governing:

•

the classified board,

•

the director's discretion in determining what he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of Principal Financial
Group, Inc.,

•

the liability of directors,

•

the removal of directors by shareholders,

•

the prohibition on stockholder actions by written consent and

•

the supermajority voting requirements.

In
addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an "interested stockholder" to engage in business combinations with us.
An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.

Risks relating to our business

Competition from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher
ratings and stronger financial performance may impair our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability.

We believe our ability to compete is based on a number of factors including scale, service, product features, price, investment performance,
commission structure, distribution capacity, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, mutual funds,
broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers, many of which have advantages over us in one or more of the above competitive factors.



Each
of our segments faces strong competition:

•

The primary competitors for our Retirement and Income Solutions and Principal Global Investors segments are asset managers, banks,
broker-dealers and insurers. Our ability to increase and retain AUM is directly related to the performance of our investments as measured against market averages and the performance of our
competitors. Even when securities prices are generally rising, performance can be affected by investment styles.

•

Competition for our Principal International segment comes primarily from local financial services firms and other international companies
operating on a stand-alone basis or in partnership with local firms.

•

Our U.S. Insurance Solutions segment competes with other insurance companies.

In
the event competitors charge lower premiums or fees for substantially similar products, we may face pressure to lower our prices in order to attract and retain customers. Reductions
in the premiums and fees we charge may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.

Damage to our reputation may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.

Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to earn and maintain the trust and confidence of customers, distributors, employees and
other stakeholders. Damage to our reputation may arise from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, litigation or regulatory actions, compliance failures, employee misconduct and
unfavorable press coverage. Any damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, distributors and employees, potentially leading to a reduction in our
revenues and profitability.

A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals,
reduce new sales and terminate relationships with distributors, impact existing liabilities and increase our cost of capital, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and financial
condition.

A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody's and S&P publish financial strength ratings on U.S. life insurance companies as well as some of our international
insurance companies. These ratings are indicators of an insurance company's ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations. These rating agencies also assign credit ratings on non-life
insurance entities, such as PFG and Principal Financial Services, Inc. ("PFS"). Credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely
manner, and are important factors in overall funding profile and ability to access external capital.

Ratings
are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and maintaining public confidence in products being offered. A ratings downgrade, or the
potential for such a downgrade, could, among other things:

•

materially increase the number of surrenders for all or a portion of the net cash values by the owners of policies and contracts we have
issued, and materially increase the number of withdrawals by policyholders of cash values from their policies;

•

result in the termination of our relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers and other distributors of our products and
services;

•

reduce new sales, particularly with respect to full service payout products and general account GICs and funding agreements purchased by
pension plans and other institutions;

•

cause some of our existing liabilities to be subject to acceleration, additional collateral support, changes in terms, or creation of
additional financial obligations and

•

increase our cost of capital and limit our access to the capital markets.

Any
of these consequences could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.

Client terminations or withdrawals or changes in investor preferences may lead to a reduction in revenues for
our asset management and accumulation businesses.

Revenues from our asset management and accumulation products are primarily fee-based. Our asset-based fees are typically calculated as a
percentage of the market value of assets under management. Our asset management and accumulation clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or withdraw funds, generally on short notice.
Client terminations and withdrawals may be driven by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, investment performance, investor preferences or changes in our reputation in the marketplace.
Significant terminations or withdrawals may reduce our AUM, thus adversely affecting our revenues and profitability.

In
addition, fee levels can vary significantly among different types of investments. We generally earn higher fees on liquid alternatives and equity investments vs. fixed income
investments and on actively managed investments vs. indexed or passive investment strategies. Therefore, our fee revenue is impacted by both the value and the composition of our AUM. Investor
preferences with respect to asset classes and investment strategies may shift over time due to market conditions, tax law changes, regulatory changes and various other factors. Changes in the
composition of our assets under management may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.



Guarantees within certain of our products that protect policyholders may decrease our earnings or increase
the volatility of our results of operations or financial position under U.S. GAAP if our hedging or risk management strategies prove ineffective or insufficient.

Certain of our variable annuity products include guaranteed minimum death benefits and/or guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits. Periods of
significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit or policyholder
account balance liabilities associated with such products, resulting in a reduction to net income. We use derivative instruments to attempt to mitigate changes in the liability exposure related to
interest rate, equity market and volatility movements, and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities. However, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that
derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. The liability exposure and volatility of net income may also be influenced by changes in market credit spreads reflecting our own
creditworthiness, for which we do not attempt to hedge. In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder
behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. These, individually or collectively, may have a
material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity. We are also subject to the risk that the cost of hedging these guaranteed minimum benefits increases as implied volatilities
increase and/or interest rates decrease, resulting in a reduction to net income.

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees and sales representatives and develop new
distribution sources, our results of operations, financial condition and sales of our products may be adversely impacted.

Our continued success is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We face intense competition in attracting
and retaining key employees, including investment, marketing, finance, legal, compliance and other professionals. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our results of operations
and financial condition may be adversely impacted.

We
distribute our asset accumulation, asset management and life and specialty benefit insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels, including our own
internal sales representatives, independent brokers, banks, broker-dealers and other third party marketing organizations. We must attract and retain sales representatives to sell our products. Strong
competition exists among financial services companies for efficient sales representatives. We compete with other financial services companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our
financial position, support services and compensation and product features. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient sales representatives to sell our products, our ability to compete and
revenues from new sales would suffer.

Our
ability to increase and retain AUM is directly related to the performance of our investments as measured against market averages and the performance of our competitors. If we are
unable to attract and retain qualified portfolio managers, we may face reduced sales and increased cash outflows in our asset accumulation and asset management businesses.

Our international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that could reduce our
profitability in those businesses.

Our international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in our operations in the U.S. We face the
risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations
out of the locations in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some of our international businesses are, and are likely to continue to be, in
emerging or potentially volatile markets. In addition, we rely on local staff, including local sales forces, in those locations where there is a risk we may encounter labor problems with local staff,
especially in locations where workers' associations and trade unions are strong. Some of our international businesses are joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest. In these joint ventures,
we lack complete management and operational control over the operations, which may limit our ability to take action to protect or increase the value of our investment in the joint venture.

We may need to fund deficiencies in our Closed Block assets.

In connection with its conversion in 1998 into a stock life insurance company, Principal Life established an accounting mechanism, known as a
"Closed Block" for the benefit of participating ordinary life insurance policies that had a dividend scale in force on July 1, 1998. Dividend scales are the actuarial formulas used by life
insurance companies to determine amounts payable as dividends on participating policies based on experience factors relating to, among other things, investment results, mortality, lapse rates,
expenses, premium taxes and policy loan interest and utilization rates. The Closed Block was designed to provide reasonable assurance to policyholders
included in the Closed Block that, after the conversion, assets would be available to maintain the aggregate dividend scales in effect for 1997 if the experience underlying such scales were to
continue.

We
allocated assets to the Closed Block as of July 1, 1998, in an amount such that we expected their cash flows, together with anticipated revenues from the policies in the Closed
Block, to be sufficient to support the Closed Block business, including payment of claims, certain direct expenses, charges and taxes and to provide for the continuation of



aggregate
dividend scales in accordance with the 1997 policy dividend scales if the experience underlying such scales continued, and to allow for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the
experience changed. We bear the costs of administrative expenses associated with Closed Block policies and, accordingly, these costs were not funded as part of the assets allocated to the Closed
Block. Any increase in such costs in the future will be borne by us. As of December 31, 2016, Closed Block assets and liabilities were $3,893.7 million and $4,442.8 million,
respectively.

We
will continue to pay guaranteed benefits under the policies included in the Closed Block, in accordance with their terms. The Closed Block assets, cash flows generated by the Closed
Block assets and anticipated revenues from policies included in the Closed Block may not be sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies. If they are not sufficient, we must
fund the shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose for business reasons to support dividend payments on policies in the Closed Block with our general account funds.

The
Closed Block assets, cash flows generated by the Closed Block assets and anticipated revenues from policies in the Closed Block will benefit only the holders of those policies. In
addition, to the extent these amounts are greater than the amounts estimated at the time we funded the Closed Block, dividends payable in respect of the policies included in the Closed Block may be
greater than they would have been in the absence of a Closed Block. Any excess net income will be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders but will not be available to our
stockholders. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6, Closed Block" for further details.

A pandemic, terrorist attack, military action or other catastrophic event could adversely affect our net
income.

Our mortality and morbidity experience could be adversely impacted by a catastrophic event. In addition, a severe catastrophic event may cause
significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The resulting macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows, as well as the
value and liquidity of our invested assets. We may also experience operational disruptions if our employees are unable or unwilling to come to work due to a pandemic or other catastrophe.

Our reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates, which could adversely impact our
net income and financial condition.

We cede life, disability, health and long-term care insurance to other insurance companies through reinsurance. See Item 8. "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies." The collectability of reinsurance recoverables
is largely dependent on the solvency of the individual insurers. We remain liable to the policyholder, even if the reinsurer defaults on its obligations with respect to the ceded business. In
addition, a reinsurer's insolvency may cause us to lose our reserve credits on the ceded business, in which case we would be required to establish additional reserves.

The
premium rates we charge are based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a certain cost. Most of our reinsurance contracts contain provisions that limit
the reinsurer's ability to increase rates on in-force business; however, some do not. If a reinsurer raises the rates it charges on a block of in-force business, our profitability may be negatively
impacted if we are not able to pass the increased costs on to the customer. If reinsurers raise the rates they charge on new business, we may be forced to raise the premiums we charge, which could
have a negative impact on our competitive position.

We face risks arising from acquisitions of businesses.

We have acquired businesses in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future. We face a number of risks arising from acquisition
transactions, including difficulties in integrating the acquired business into our operations, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the
existing customers of the acquired entity, unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired business, unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth
expectations for the acquired business and sustained declines in the equity market that could reduce the AUM and fee revenues for certain acquired businesses. These risks may prevent us from realizing
the expected benefits from acquisitions and could result in the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of acquisition.

For
additional information on our goodwill and other intangible assets, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

A computer system failure or security breach could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and adversely
impact our profitability.

We rely on computer systems to conduct business, including customer service, marketing and sales activities, customer relationship management
and producing financial statements. While we have policies, procedures, automation and backup plans designed to prevent or limit the effect of failure, our computer systems may be vulnerable to
disruptions or breaches as the result of natural disasters, man-made disasters, criminal activity, pandemics, or other



events
beyond our control. The failure of our computer systems for any reason could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of customer business and adversely impact our profitability.

We
retain confidential information on our computer systems, including customer information and proprietary business information. Any compromise of the security of our computer systems
that results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation, increase regulatory scrutiny and require us to incur significant
technical, legal and other expenses.

Loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect information of our customers or employees
could adversely affect our business or result in losses.

We rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the United States and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of computer
hardware and software and vendors of services. In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to
protect personal information of our customers or employees, we may suffer operational impairments, reputational damage and financial losses.

Our enterprise risk management framework may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating all of the
risks to which we are exposed.

We utilize an integrated risk management framework, which is designed to manage material risks within established risk appetites and risk
tolerances. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. Many of our methods for managing and mitigating risk
rely on models and assumptions that are based, in part, on observed historical data. As a result, these methods may not accurately predict future exposures, which may be significantly greater than our
historical measures indicate. We may be exposed to unanticipated risks as a result of changes in market conditions, new products or new business strategies, catastrophes or other unforeseen
circumstances. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we may suffer unexpected losses, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our financial results may be adversely impacted by global climate changes.

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution, resulting
in a gradual increase in global average temperatures and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. These trends are expected to continue in the future and have the potential to
impact nearly all sectors of the economy to varying degrees. Our initial research indicates that climate change does not pose an imminent or significant threat to our operations or business, but we
will continue to monitor new developments in the future.

Potential
impacts may include the following:

•

Changes in temperatures and air quality may adversely impact our mortality and morbidity rates. For example, increases in the level of
pollution and airborne allergens may cause an increase in upper respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, leading to increased claims in our insurance businesses. However, the risk of increased
mortality on our life insurance business may be partly offset by our payout annuity business, where an increase in mortality results in a decrease in benefit payments.

•

Climate change may impact asset prices, as well as general economic conditions. For example, rising sea levels may lead to decreases in real
estate values in coastal areas. Additionally, government policies to slow climate change (e.g., setting limits on carbon emissions) may have an adverse impact on sectors such as utilities,
transportation and manufacturing. Changes in asset prices may impact the value of our fixed income, real estate and commercial mortgage investments. We manage our investment risks by maintaining a
well-diversified portfolio, both geographically and by sector. We also monitor our investments on an ongoing basis, allowing us to adjust our exposure to sectors and/or geographical areas that face
severe risks due to climate change.

•

A natural disaster that affects one of our office locations could disrupt our operations and pose a threat to the safety of our employees.
However, we have extensive Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery planning programs in place to help mitigate this risk.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

As of December 31, 2016, we owned 33 properties in our home office complex in Des Moines, Iowa, and in various other locations. Of these
33 properties, 17 are office buildings, 1 is a warehouse facility, 12 are parking lots and ramps, 1 is a park/green space, 1 is a childcare center and 1 is a power generation plant. Of the
office and warehouse space, we occupy approximately 92% of the 2.6 million square feet of space in these buildings. The balance of the space in these buildings is rented to commercial tenants
or is occupied by the property management company servicing these properties.



We
lease office space for various offices located throughout the U.S. and internationally. We believe that our owned and leased properties are suitable and adequate for our current business
operations.

For
a discussion of items materially affecting the comparability of 2016, 2015 and 2014, please see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations."

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following analysis discusses our financial condition as of December 31, 2016, compared with December 31, 2015, and our
consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance. The discussion should
be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this
Form 10-K.

Forward-Looking Information

Our narrative analysis below contains forward-looking statements intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our future financial
performance. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that represent our beliefs concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments, and
contain words and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current
expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.



Actual
results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not
limited to, the risk factors listed in Item 1A. "Risk Factors."

Overview

We provide financial products and services through the following reportable segments:

•

Retirement and Income Solutions;

•

Principal Global Investors;

•

Principal International and

•

U.S. Insurance Solutions.

We
also have a Corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment. See Item 1. "Business" for a description of our
reportable segments.

Economic Factors and Trends

Positive market performance and net customer cash flows led to account value increases in our Retirement and Income Solutions segment and AUM
increases in our Principal Global Investors segment. Since account values and AUM are the base by which these businesses generate revenues, the increase in account values and AUM has contributed to
the overall improvement of our operating revenues in these segments.

In
our Principal International segment, we continued to grow our business organically through our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures and through strategic acquisitions. Local
currency AUM, a key indicator of earnings growth for the segment, increased significantly as a result of positive net customer cash flows and market performance. The financial results for the
Principal International segment are also impacted by fluctuations of the foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for the locations in which we have business.

The
U.S. Insurance Solutions segment has been impacted by lower interest rates for the past few years, which has caused spread compression and led to higher reserves. This has resulted
in changes to our product offerings.

Profitability

Our profitability depends in large part upon our:

•

amount of AUM;

•

ability to manage the difference between the investment income we earn and the interest we credit to policyholders;

•

ability to generate fee revenues by providing administrative and investment management services;

•

ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the related
expenses;

•

ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or
impairments of invested assets;

•

ability to effectively hedge fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates on certain transactions and

•

ability to manage our operating expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our
accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature
of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies." We have identified critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment and estimates about matters that are inherently
uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to
changes in estimates and changes in guidance. The identification, selection and disclosure of critical accounting estimates and policies have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors.

Valuation and Impairment of Fixed Income Investments

Fixed Maturities.

Fixed maturities include bonds, asset-backed securities ("ABS"), redeemable preferred stock and certain
non-redeemable preferred
securities. We classify our fixed maturities as either AFS or trading and, accordingly, carry them at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. Volatility in net income can
result from



changes
in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading. Volatility in other comprehensive income can result from changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as AFS.

The
fair values of our public fixed maturities are primarily based on market prices from third party pricing vendors. We have regular interactions with these vendors to ensure we
understand their pricing methodologies and to confirm they are utilizing observable market information. In addition, 6% of our invested asset portfolio as of December 31, 2016, was invested in
privately placed fixed maturities with no readily available market quotes to determine the fair market value. The majority of these assets are valued using a matrix pricing valuation approach that
utilizes observable market inputs. In the matrix approach, securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by sector, rating and average life. Each pricing category is assigned a risk spread
based on studies of observable public market data from the investment professionals assigned to specific security classes. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted back at the
current Treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread. Although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an individual security within each
pricing category may actually be impacted by company specific factors.

If
we are unable to price a fixed maturity security using prices from third party pricing vendors or other sources specific to the asset class, we may obtain a broker quote or utilize an
internal pricing model specific to the asset utilizing relevant market information, to the extent available and where at least one significant unobservable input is utilized. These are reflected in
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and can include fixed maturities across all asset classes. As of December 31, 2016, less than 1% of our total fixed maturities were Level 3
securities valued using internal pricing models. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Fair Value Measurements"
for further discussion.

The
$257.4 million increase in net unrealized gains from U.S. investment operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, can primarily be attributed to tightening of
credit spreads, partially offset by an approximate 9 basis point increase in interest rates. For additional information about interest rate risk see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk".

Fixed
maturities classified as AFS are subject to impairment reviews. When evaluating fixed maturities for impairment, we consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether
a credit or interest rate-related impairment of a security is other than temporary. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has
been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events;
(4) for structured
securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows and (5) our intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its
amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. To the extent we determine a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. See item 8.
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments" for further discussion.

A
number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks and
uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that
issuer; (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; (3) the risk that our investment professionals are
making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and
circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period. As of
December 31, 2016, we had $17,466.4 million in AFS fixed maturities with gross unrealized losses totaling $648.8 million. Included in the gross unrealized losses are losses
attributable to both movements in market interest rates as well as movement in credit spreads.

Mortgage Loans.

Mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. As of December 31, 2016, the
carrying value of
our commercial mortgage loans was $12,027.8 million. Commercial mortgage loans on real estate are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts,
computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances.

Commercial
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to
contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we determine a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the
estimated value reduced by the cost to sell. Estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's
observable market price or fair value of the collateral. Subsequent changes in the estimated value are reflected in the valuation allowance. Amounts on loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off
and removed from the valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance provision is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated statements of operations.

The
valuation allowance is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Management's periodic evaluation and assessment of the
valuation allowance adequacy is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of



the
underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, portfolio delinquency information, underwriting standards, peer group information, current economic conditions, loss experience and other
relevant factors. The evaluation of our impaired loan component is subjective, as it requires the estimation of timing and amount of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. For
more detailed information concerning mortgage loan valuation allowances and impairments, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 4, Investments — Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowance."

We
have a large experienced commercial real estate staff centrally located in Des Moines, which includes commercial mortgage underwriters, loan closers, loan servicers, engineers,
appraisers, credit analysts, research staff, legal staff,
information technology personnel and portfolio managers. Experienced commercial real estate senior management adheres to a disciplined process in reviewing all transactions for approval on a
consistent basis. During 2016, the typical new commercial mortgage loan at origination averaged 52% loan-to-value with a 2.6 times debt service coverage ratio and was internally rated A on a bond
equivalent basis. Our entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held in our Principal Global Investors segment, averaged 46% loan-to-value ratio with a 2.7 times debt service
coverage ratio as of December 31, 2016. The large equity cushion and strong debt service coverage in our commercial mortgage loan investments will help insulate us from stress during times of
weak commercial real estate fundamentals.

Derivatives

We primarily use derivatives to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks. The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives are determined through
quoted market prices. The fair values of derivative instruments cleared through centralized clearinghouses are determined through market prices published by the clearinghouses. The fair values of
non-cleared over-the-counter ("OTC") derivative instruments are determined using either pricing valuation models that utilize market observable inputs or broker quotes. On an absolute fair value basis
as of December 31, 2016, 53% of our OTC derivative assets and liabilities were valued using pricing valuation models, 43% using clearinghouse prices and the remaining 4% using broker quotes.
See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Fair Value Measurements" for further discussion. The fair values of our
derivative instruments can be impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity indices and volatility, as well as other contributing factors. For additional
information see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk".

We
also issue certain annuity contracts and other insurance contracts that include embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated from the host contract. They are valued using a
combination of historical data and actuarial judgment. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Fair Value
Measurements" for further discussion. We include our assumption for own non-performance risk in the valuation of these embedded derivatives. As our credit spreads widen or tighten, the fair value of
the embedded derivative liabilities decrease or increase, leading to an increase or decrease in net income. If the current market credit spreads reflecting our own creditworthiness move to zero
(tighten), the reduction to net income would be approximately $76.7 million, net of DAC and income taxes, based on December 31, 2016, reported amounts. In addition, the policyholder
behavior assumptions used in the valuation of embedded derivatives include risk margins, which increase the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities.

The
accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the applicable accounting standards continue to evolve. Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment. Judgment and estimates are used to determine the fair value of some of our derivatives. Volatility in net income
can result from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting and changes in fair value of embedded derivatives.

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances

Incremental direct costs of contract acquisition as well as certain costs directly related to acquisition activities (underwriting, policy
issuance and processing, medical and inspection and sales force contract selling) for the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and investment contract business are capitalized
to the extent recoverable. Commissions and other incremental direct costs of contract acquisition for the acquisition of long-term service contracts are also capitalized to the extent recoverable.
Maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to net income as incurred.

Amortization Based on Estimated Gross Profits.

DAC for universal life-type insurance contracts and certain investment contracts
are amortized over
the expected lifetime of the contracts in relation to estimated gross profits ("EGPs"). As of December 31, 2016, these policies accounted for 62% of our total DAC balance. In addition to DAC,
the following actuarial balances are also amortized in relation to EGPs.

•

Sales inducement asset — Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the contractholder's account balance as an
inducement to purchase the contract. Like DAC, the cost of the sales inducement is capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract, in proportion to EGPs.



•

Unearned revenue liability — An unearned revenue liability is established when we collect fees or other policyholder
assessments that represent compensation for services to be provided in future periods. These revenues are deferred and then amortized over the expected life of the contract, in proportion to EGPs.

•

Reinsurance asset or liability — For universal-life type products that are reinsured, a reinsurance asset or liability is
established to spread the expected net reinsurance costs or profits in proportion to the EGPs on the underlying business.

We
also have additional benefit reserves that are established for annuity or universal life-type contracts that provide benefit guarantees, or for contracts that are expected to produce
profits followed by losses. The liabilities are accrued in relation to estimated contract assessments.

Key
assumptions used in the calculation of EGPs include mortality, morbidity, lapses, equity returns, general account investment yields and expenses as well as the change in our
liability for certain guarantees and the difference between actual and expected reinsurance premiums and recoveries, depending on the nature of the contract. Our general account investment yield
assumption reflects our long-term projections of interest rates and net realized capital gains (losses). We develop an estimate of EGPs at issue and each valuation date. As actual experience and
market conditions emerge, the gross profits may vary from those expected either in magnitude or timing, in which case a true-up of actuarial balances occurs as a charge or credit to current net
income. In addition, we are required to revise our assumptions regarding future experience if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised; we refer to this as
unlocking. Both actions, reflecting actual experience and market conditions and changing future estimates, can change both the current amount and the future amortization pattern of the DAC asset and
related actuarial balances.

For
individual variable life insurance, individual variable annuities and group annuities that have separate account U.S. equity investment options, we utilize a mean reversion
methodology (reversion to the mean assumption), a common industry practice, to determine the future domestic equity market growth rate assumption used for the calculation of EGPs. If actual annualized
U.S. equity market performance varies from our 8% long-term assumption, we assume different performance levels in the short-term such that the weighted average return is equal to the long-term
assumption over the mean reversion period. However, our mean reversion process generally limits assumed returns to a range of 4-12% during the mean reversion period.

Amortization Based on Estimated Gross Revenues.

DAC and certain of the actuarial balances on a portion of our universal life
products are amortized
in proportion to estimated gross revenues rather than EGPs. Estimated gross revenues include similar assumptions as the revenue component of EGPs and the changes of future estimates and reflection of
actual experience and market conditions is done in the same manner as EGPs discussed above. As of December 31, 2016, these policies accounted for 8% of our total DAC balance.

Amortization Based on Estimated Gross Margins.

DAC for participating life insurance products are amortized in proportion to
estimated gross margins
("EGMs") rather than EGPs. EGMs include similar assumption items as EGPs, and amortization schedules were developed using models last updated when we stopped selling participating business in
the early 2000s. Some products allow for underwritten death benefit increases and cost of living adjustments, resulting in a material amount of new DAC each year, and the amortization schedules are
modified as appropriate. As of December 31, 2016, these policies accounted for 4% of our total DAC balance.

Amortization Based on Premium-Paying Period.

DAC for non-participating term life insurance and individual disability policies
are amortized over the
premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policyholder liabilities. Once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of
policies, they will not be changed over the life of the policy unless a loss recognition event occurs. As of December 31, 2016, these policies accounted for 21% of our total DAC balance.

Amortization Based on Service Period.

DAC for long-term service contracts are amortized in proportion to the revenue recognized
or straight-line if
no pattern of revenue recognition can be reasonably predicted. We amortize capitalized
costs of long-term service contracts on a straight-line basis, reflecting lapses as they are incurred, over the expected contract life. As of December 31, 2016, these contracts accounted for 5%
of our total DAC balance.

Internal Replacements.

We review policies for modifications that result in the exchange of an existing contract for a new
contract. If the new
contract is determined to be an internal replacement that is substantially changed from the replaced contract, any unamortized DAC and related actuarial balances are written off and acquisition costs
related to the new contract are capitalized as appropriate. If the new contract is substantially unchanged from the replaced contract, we continue to amortize the existing DAC and related actuarial
balances.

Recoverability.

DAC and sales inducement assets are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss
recognition testing on an
annual basis, or when an event occurs that may warrant loss recognition. If loss recognition or impairment is necessary, the asset balances are written off to the extent it is determined that future
policy premiums and investment income or gross profits are not adequate to cover related losses and expenses.

Actuarial Assumption Updates.

We periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are inputs to the models for DAC and
other actuarial
balances and make model refinements as necessary. For more information see "Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations — Other — Actuarial
Assumption Updates."



Sensitivities.

As of December 31, 2016, the net balance of DAC and related actuarial balances, excluding balances affected
by changes in other
comprehensive income ("OCI"), was a $1,445.1 million asset. We perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact that certain assumptions have on these balances. The following table shows the
estimated immediate impact of various assumption changes on our DAC and related actuarial balances.

subsidiaries are not included in the total DAC balance listed above as they are not fully consolidated.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets recorded
in connection with acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, we test the carrying value for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is tested at the
reporting unit level, which is a business one level below the operating segment. We formally conduct our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing during the third quarter. Under
certain circumstances, interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
value.

The
operating segments and associated reporting units at which we perform our testing are as follows:

•

Retirement and Income Solutions: Retirement and Income Solutions — Fee and Retirement and Income
Solutions — Spread

•

Principal Global Investors: Equity Investments, Fixed Income Investments, Real Estate and Other Alternative Investments, Mutual Funds Complex

•

Principal International: countries in which Principal International does business

•

U.S. Insurance Solutions: Specialty Benefits Insurance and Individual Life Insurance

•

Corporate: Corporate subsidiaries

Goodwill.

U.S. GAAP permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not
that the fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test of the two-step goodwill impairment test. We
continue to perform a two-step test in our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill.

In
Step 1 of the evaluation, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is greater than the carrying
value, the carrying value of the reporting unit is deemed to be recoverable, and Step 2 is not required. After completion of our 2016 Step 1 analysis, it was determined that fair values exceeded the
carrying amounts for all businesses one level below the operating segment and we did not have any business at risk of failing the Step 1 goodwill impairment test. If the fair value estimate had been
less than the carrying value, it is an indicator that impairment may exist, and Step 2 would be required. In Step 2, the reporting unit's goodwill implied fair value is determined. The reporting
unit's fair value as determined in Step 1 is assigned to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination as of the date of the
impairment test. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and written down to its implied fair value.

The
determination of fair value for our reporting units is primarily based on an income approach whereby we use discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. When available, and as
appropriate, we use market approaches or other valuation techniques to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow model used for each reporting unit is based on either income
or distributable cash flow, depending on the reporting unit being valued. We use different discount rates based upon the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the
operations.

For
the income model, we determine fair value based on the present value of the most recent income projections for each reporting unit and calculate a terminal value utilizing a terminal
growth rate. The significant assumptions in the operating income model include: income projections, including the underlying assumptions; discount rate and terminal growth rate.

For
the distributable cash flow model, we determine fair value based on the present value of projected statutory net income and changes in required capital to determine distributable
income for the respective reporting unit. The significant assumptions in the distributable cash flow model include: required capital levels; income projections, including



the
underlying assumptions; discount rate; new business projection period and new business production growth. We did not recognize an impairment in our 2016 consolidated statement of operations.

Other Intangible Assets.

U.S. GAAP permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
more-likely-than-not that
the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is less than its carrying amount to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment. We utilize the qualitative
approach on a limited basis for testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized as related benefits emerge and are reviewed periodically for
indicators of impairment in value. If facts and circumstances suggest possible impairment, the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is
compared to the current carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of
assets over their fair value. For those assets amortized as related benefits emerge, the most significant assumptions involved in the estimation of future benefits include surrender/lapse rates and
interest margins. We did not recognize an impairment in our 2016 consolidated statement of operations.

Sensitivities.

In connection with our annual impairment testing process, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill
impairment with respect to
each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The most significant goodwill and
other intangible assets within our 2016 consolidated statement of financial position resulted from our 2013 acquisition of Cuprum, whereby we recorded $631.8 million of goodwill, and from our
2006 purchase of WM Advisors, Inc., whereby we acquired $608.0 million of investment management contracts which are considered an indefinite-lived intangible. We cannot predict certain
future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets that totaled $1,020.8 million and $1,325.3 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2016. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our
customer base, interest rate movements, declines in the equity markets, the legal environment in which the businesses operate or a material negative change in our relationships with significant
customers. For further information see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Nature of Operations and Significant
Accounting Policies," and "Note 2, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

Insurance Reserves

Reserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due, at some point in the future, to or on behalf of our
policyholders. U.S. GAAP, allowing for some degree of managerial judgment, provides guidance for establishing reserves.

Future
policy benefits and claims include reserves for individual traditional and group life insurance, disability, health and long-term care insurance and individual and group annuities
that provide periodic income payments. These reserves are computed using assumptions of mortality, morbidity, lapse, investment performance and expense. These assumptions are based on our experience,
industry results, emerging trends and future expectations. For long-duration insurance contracts, once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies, they will not be changed over
the life of the policy. However, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. Premium
deficiency reserves may
also be established for short-duration contracts to provide for expected future losses. Our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis including, among other things,
experience studies, claim development analysis and annual loss recognition analysis. To the extent experience indicates potential loss recognition, we recognize losses on certain lines of business.
The ultimate accuracy of the assumptions on these long-tailed insurance products cannot be determined until the obligation of the entire block of business on which the assumptions were made is
extinguished. Short-term variances of actual results from the assumptions used in the computation of the reserves are reflected in current period net income and can impact quarter-to-quarter net
income.

Future
policy benefits and claims also include reserves for incurred but unreported health, disability, dental, vision and life insurance claims. We recognize claims costs in the period
the service was provided to our policyholders. However, claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive, process and pay the claims. We determine the
amount of this liability using actuarial methods based on historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging cost trends, where applicable, to determine our estimate of claim liabilities. We also
look back to assess how our prior periods' estimates developed. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claim expense. Historically, the
amount of the claim reserve adjustment made in subsequent reporting periods for prior period estimates have been within a reasonable range given our normal claim fluctuations.

We
periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are used to compute reserves. For more information see "Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of
Operations — Other — Actuarial Assumption Updates."

Benefit Plans

The reported expense and liability associated with pension and OPEB plans requires the use of assumptions. Numerous assumptions are made
regarding the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, turnover,



expected
compensation increases, health care claim costs, health care cost trends, retirement rates and mortality. The discount rate and the expected return on plan assets have the most significant
impact on the level of expense.

The
assumed discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments inherent in the Projected Benefit Obligation and discounting those cash flows using a spot yield curve for
high quality corporate bonds. Our assumed discount rates were 4.15% for our pension plans and 3.75% for our OPEB plans as of December 31, 2016. Typically a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate
would increase the pension benefits Projected Benefit Obligation and the Net Periodic Pension Cost ("NPPC") by approximately $114.0 million and $6.6 million, respectively. Typically a
0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase the other postretirement benefits Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation by approximately $2.4 million and would have a nominal impact
on the Net Periodic Benefit Cost ("NPBC"). Typically a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would result in decreases in benefit obligations and expenses at a level generally commensurate with those
noted above.

The
assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is set at the long-term rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans and the various classes of
the invested funds. Historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk-free real rate of return and risk premiums for each
asset class. The overall long-term rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component, the real risk free rate of return and the associated risk premium. A weighted
average rate was developed based on long-term returns for each asset class, the plan's target asset allocation policy and the tax structure of the trusts. For the 2016 NPPC and 2016 NPBC, a 7.20% and
5.24% weighted average long-term rate of return was used, respectively. For the 2017 NPPC and 2017 NPBC, a 6.70% and 4.40% weighted average long-term rate of return assumption, respectively, will be
used. Typically a 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return would increase the NPPC by approximately $5.4 million and the NPBC by approximately $1.6 million. Typically a
0.25% increase in this rate would result in a decrease to expense at the same levels. The assumed return on plan assets is based on the fair market value of plan assets as of December 31, 2016.

The
compensation increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation.

Actuarial
gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of employees, which is approximately 10 years for
pension costs and approximately 4 years for other postretirement benefit costs. The qualified pension plan does not utilize the allowable corridor, while the nonqualified pension plan and OPEB
plans utilize the 10% corridor. Prior service costs are amortized on a weighted average basis over approximately 1 year for pension costs and 2 years for OPEB costs. See Item 8.
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Employee and Agent Benefits" for further discussion.

Income Taxes

We provide for income taxes based on our estimate of the liability for taxes due. Our tax accounting represents management's best estimate of
various events and transactions, such as completion of tax audits or establishment of, or changes to, a valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets, which could affect our
estimates and effective income tax rate in a particular quarter or annual period. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. We are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred
tax assets each quarter and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realizable. In determining the need for a
valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and
carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies management would employ to realize the tax benefit.

U.S.
federal and state deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,088.4 million and $1,004.6 million of accumulated but undistributed earnings from
operations of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We do not record U.S. federal and state deferred income taxes on foreign earnings not expected to be
distributed to the U.S. We apply an exception to the general rule, which under U.S. GAAP otherwise requires the recording of U.S. deferred income taxes on the anticipated repatriation of
foreign earnings as recognized for financial reporting purposes. The exception permits us to not record a U.S. deferred income tax liability on foreign earnings we expect to be indefinitely reinvested
in our foreign operations. The related deferred income taxes will be recorded in the period it becomes apparent we can no longer positively assert some or all the undistributed earnings will remain
invested into the foreseeable future.

Inherent
in the provision for income taxes are estimates and our expectations regarding the deductibility of certain items, the timing of income and expense recognition, future
performance and the current or future realization of operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credits. We regularly evaluate the capital needs of our domestic and foreign operations
considering all available information, including operating and capital plans, regulatory capital requirements, parent company financing and cash flow needs, as well as tax laws applicable to our
domestic and foreign subsidiaries. In the event these estimates differ from our prior estimates due to the receipt of new
information, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Any such change



could
significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these estimates change. A significant decline in value of financial assets could lead to
establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets having an adverse effect on current and future results. In management's judgment, total deferred income tax assets are
more-likely-than-not to be realized.

In
addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits in the U.S. as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized for book purposes when the
more-likely-than-not threshold is met with regard to the validity of an uncertain tax position. Once this threshold is met, for each uncertain tax position we recognize in earnings the largest amount
of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the Internal Revenue Service or other income taxing authorities for audits ongoing or not yet commenced.

We
had $242.9 million and $229.9 million of current income tax receivables associated with outstanding audit issues reported as other assets in our consolidated statements
of financial position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We believe there are adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution of
contested issues could take several years while legal remedies are pursued. Consequently, we do not anticipate the ultimate resolution of audits ongoing or not yet commenced to have a material impact
on our net income.

Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations

Acquisitions

We entered into acquisition agreements for the following businesses.

AXA Hong Kong Pension Business.

On September 1, 2015, we finalized the purchase of AXA's MPF and ORSO pension business in
Hong Kong for
$335.5 million. As part of the transaction, we entered into an exclusive 15-year distribution agreement with AXA to provide co-branded pension products through AXA's extensive agency network in
Hong Kong. We more than doubled the AUM in our Hong Kong pension business to $5.9 billion. AXA's MPF and ORSO pension business is consolidated within our Principal International segment.

Columbus Circle Investors.

On September 30, 2014, we acquired an additional 24.65% interest in Columbus Circle Investors
from the minority
shareholder partners and contracted to purchase the remaining interest from the minority shareholder partners in two installments. The first installment for an additional 2.5% interest was paid on
April 28, 2015. The second installment for the remaining 2.5% interest was paid on April 28, 2016. We now own 100% of Columbus Circle Investors, which is consolidated within our
Principal Global Investors segment.

Other

Actuarial Assumption Updates.

We periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are inputs to the models for DAC and
other actuarial
balances and make model refinements as necessary. During the third quarter of 2016, assumption updates and model refinements were made resulting in an unlocking of DAC and other actuarial balances
that decreased total company net income by $68.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The pre-tax operating earnings impact was $(33.2) million for our U.S. Insurance Solutions
segment, $(31.6) million for our Retirement and Income Solutions segment and $(8.9) million for our Principal International segment for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During
the third quarter of 2015, assumption updates and model refinements were made resulting in an unlocking of DAC and other actuarial balances that increased total company net income
by $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The pre-tax operating earnings impact was $76.8 million for our U.S. Insurance Solutions segment and $(28.7) million for our
Retirement and Income Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2015.

During
the third quarter of 2014, assumption updates and model refinements were made resulting in an unlocking of DAC and other actuarial balances that increased total company net income
by $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The pre-tax operating earnings impact was $60.0 million for our U.S. Insurance Solutions segment and $2.6 million for
our Retirement and Income Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The
individual life insurance business actuarial assumption updates and model refinements had the most significant impact and affected several line items within our income statement. The
following table presents the increase (decrease) on the individual life insurance income statement line items for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Chilean Legal Entity Merger.

In January 2015, we received regulatory approval and executed upon the merger of two of our Chilean
legal entities. As a
result of the merger, we recognized a $105.2 million benefit in net income available to common stockholders in first quarter 2015 to reflect a change in deferred tax balances related to the
merged entity.

Other Factors Affecting Comparability

Fluctuations in Foreign Currency to U.S. Dollar Exchange Rates

Fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for locations in which we have operations can affect reported financial results.
In years when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in fewer U.S. dollars to be reported. When foreign currencies strengthen,
translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in more U.S. dollars to be reported.

Foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations create variances in our financial statement line items. The most significant impact occurs within our Principal International segment where
pre-tax operating earnings were negatively impacted $25.3 million and $69.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of fluctuations in
foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. This impact was calculated by comparing (a) the difference between current year results and prior year results to (b) the difference
between current year results and prior year results translated using current year exchange rates for both periods. We use this approach to calculate the impact of exchange rates on all revenue and
expense line items. For a discussion of our approaches to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk — Foreign Currency Risk."

Effects of Inflation

The impact of inflation has not had a material effect on our annual consolidated results of operations over the past three years. However, we
may be materially affected by inflation in the future.

Variable Investment Income

Variable investment income includes certain types of investment returns such as prepayment fees and income (loss) from certain elements of our
other alternative asset classes, including results of value-add real estate sales activity. Due to its unpredictable nature, variable investment income may or may not be material to our financial
results for a given reporting period and may create variances when comparing different reporting periods. For additional information, see "Investments — Investment Results."

Recent Regulatory Changes

On April 6, 2016, the DOL released its final fiduciary definition regulation package. The regulation broadens the definition of a
fiduciary under ERISA to include persons providing investment advice to an employee benefit plan or an IRA for a fee or other compensation. The DOL also released two new prohibited transaction class
exemptions and amendments to current prohibited transaction exemptions. Broker-dealers and advisors are in various stages of determining the implications of the regulations on their business models,
and how they proceed could impact our business. Even with this fluid environment, our preliminary assessment of the new regulation's impact to our business and future financial results indicates the
costs will not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As the rules become applicable and are operationalized, we will assess what business impacts need to be
addressed and how they affect the organization.

Recent Accounting Changes

For recent accounting changes, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders increased $158.4 million as a result of after-tax net realized capital gains in 2016 as
compared to after-tax net realized capital losses in 2015 primarily related to derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. In addition, net income available to common stockholders increased due
to a $128.8 million increase in after-tax net investment income attributable to higher average invested assets in our U.S. operations and a $45.6 million increase in after-tax variable
investment income. These increases were partially offset by a $105.2 million benefit from a change in deferred tax balances related to the merger of two of our Chilean legal entities in 2015
and a $95.0 million after-tax decrease related to actuarial assumption updates and model refinements that had an unfavorable impact on net income in 2016 as compared to a favorable impact in
2015. Additionally, these increases were partially offset by a $49.1 million decrease attributable to lower investment yields on invested assets in our U.S. operations.

Total Revenues

Premiums decreased $150.5 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to lower sales of individual annuities
with life contingencies. Premiums increased $117.7 million for the U.S. Insurance Solutions segment primarily resulting from growth in the business. Premiums increased for the Principal
International segment primarily in Latin America due to $28.0 million higher sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies in Chile partially offset by $6.3 million weakening
of the Chilean peso against the U.S. dollar.

Fees
and other revenues decreased $75.8 million for the Corporate segment primarily due to income on a tax indemnification recognized in 2015. Fees and other revenues decreased
$35.5 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to challenging equity market performance. Fees and other revenues increased $42.3 million for the U.S.
Insurance Solutions segment primarily resulting from growth in the business. Fees and other revenues increased $37.7 million for the Principal Global Investors segment primarily due to
increased AUM.



Net
investment income increased primarily due to $198.1 million attributable to higher average invested assets in our U.S. operations and a $70.1 million increase in
variable investment income. These increases were partially offset by a $75.6 million decrease attributable to lower investment yields on invested assets in our U.S. operations. For additional
information, see "Investments — Investment Results — Net Investment Income."

Net
realized capital gains (losses) can be volatile due to other-than-temporary impairments of invested assets, mark-to-market adjustments of certain invested assets and our decision to
sell invested assets. We had net realized capital gains in 2016 as compared to net realized capital losses in 2015 primarily due to change in derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. For
additional information, see "Investments — Investment Results — Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)."

Total Expenses

Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased for the U.S. Insurance Solutions segment primarily due to a $117.3 million increase
resulting from an unfavorable unlocking impact associated with actuarial assumption updates and model refinements in 2016 as compared to a favorable unlocking impact in 2015. Additionally, benefits,
claims and settlement expenses increased $90.1 million for the U.S. Insurance Solutions segment resulting from growth in our specialty benefits insurance business.

Operating
expenses increased for the Corporate segment primarily due to $86.4 million of one-time costs incurred to extinguish long-term debt in 2016 and $10.0 million
higher interest expense in 2016 associated with the issuance of long-term debt in 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $42.8 million negative impact of a court ruling on some
uncertain tax positions in 2015.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 14% and 12% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Item 8.
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10, Income Taxes — Effective Income Tax Rate" for further discussion.

Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders increased primarily due to a $105.2 million change in deferred tax balances related to the
merger of two of our Chilean legal entities and a $44.2 million impairment of Liongate, an equity method investment, in 2014. These increases were partially offset by a $35.9 million
after-tax decrease in gains on sales of real estate investments and joint venture real estate, net losses in 2015 compared to net gains in 2014 resulting from a $17.6 million after-tax decrease
in equity securities, trading and a $14.2 million after-tax write-off of unamortized book value on corporate owned real estate in 2015.

Total Revenues

Premiums increased $1,426.9 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to higher sales of single premium group
and individual annuities with life contingencies. The single premium group annuity product, which is typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations, can generate large premiums from very few
customers and therefore premiums tend to vary from period to period.

Fee
revenues increased $88.5 million for the Principal Global Investors segment primarily due to higher management fee revenue as a result of increased AUM. Fee revenues increased
$52.9 million for the Corporate segment primarily due to income on a tax indemnification.

Net
investment income decreased primarily due to a $97.5 million decrease attributable to lower investment yields on invested assets and cash in our U.S. operations. In addition,
net investment income decreased $85.6 million due to the weakening of the Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar. For additional information, see "Investments —
Investment Results — Net Investment Income."

Net
realized capital gains (losses) can be volatile due to other-than-temporary impairments of invested assets, mark-to-market adjustments of certain invested assets and our decision to
sell invested assets. We had net realized capital losses in 2015 as compared to net realized capital gains in 2014 primarily due to a $55.2 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate
investments and joint venture real estate, net losses in 2015 compared to net gains in 2014 resulting from a $25.1 million decrease in equity securities, trading, a $21.9 million
write-off of unamortized book value on corporate owned real estate in 2015 and $11.4 million of increased losses on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. This was partially offset
by a $44.2 million impairment of Liongate, an equity method investment, in 2014. For additional information, see "Investments — Investment Results — Net
Realized Capital Gains (Losses)."



Total Expenses

Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $1,391.5 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to an
increase in reserves resulting from higher sales of single premium group and individual annuities with life contingencies.

Operating
expenses increased for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to a $30.6 million increase resulting from unfavorable DAC unlocking associated with the
review and update of our actuarial assumptions in 2015 and a $26.5 million increase in staff related costs including pension and OPEB. Operating expenses increased $48.1 million for the
Principal Global Investors segment primarily due to expenses supporting growth in the business.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 12% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective income tax
rate decreased to 12% from 21% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to a 7% change in deferred tax balances related to the merger of two of our Chilean
legal entities and a 4% change in net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the third quarter 2014 enactment of tax legislation in Chile not replicated in 2015, partially offset by the 3% negative
impact of a court ruling on some uncertain tax positions. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10, Income
Taxes — Effective Income Tax Rate" for further discussion.

Results of Operations by Segment

For results of operations by segment see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 16, Segment Information."

Retirement and Income Solutions Segment

Retirement and Income Solutions Trends

Several key factors impact revenue and earnings growth in the Retirement and Income Solutions segment. These factors include: the ability of our
distribution channels to generate new sales and retain existing business; pricing decisions that take account of competitive conditions, persistency, investment returns, mortality trends, and
operating expense levels; investment management performance; equity market returns and interest rate changes. Profitability ultimately depends on our ability to price products and invest assets at a
level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products.

Net
revenue is a key metric used to understand Retirement and Income Solutions earnings growth. Net revenue is defined as operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses
less dividends to policyholders. Net revenue from Retirement and Income Solutions — Fee is primarily fee based and is impacted by changes in the equity markets. Net revenue from
Retirement and Income Solutions — Spread is driven by the difference between investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited to the
contracts.

Principal Global Investors Segment Summary Financial Data

AUM is a key indicator of earnings growth for the Principal Global Investors segment, as AUM is the base by which we generate revenues. Net cash
flow and market performance are the two main drivers of AUM growth. Net cash flow reflects our ability to attract and retain client deposits. Market performance reflects equity, fixed income, real
estate and other alternative investment market performance. The percentage growth in revenues of the segment will generally track with the percentage growth in AUM. This trend may vary due to changes
in business and/or product mix.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015

Pre-Tax Operating Earnings

Pre-tax operating earnings increased due to a $31.0 million increase in management fee revenue as a result of increased AUM and a
$19.1 million increase in performance fee revenue largely in our real estate business.

Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014

Pre-Tax Operating Earnings

Pre-tax operating earnings increased due to $91.0 million higher management fee revenue as a result of increased AUM, approximately
$10.0 million from performance fees primarily realized in our real estate business and $8.5 million from our increased ownership in Columbus Circle Investors. These increases were
partially offset by $70.0 million increased expenses to support our business.

Principal International Segment

Principal International Trends

Our Principal International businesses focus on locations with growing middle classes, favorable demographics and increasing long-term savings,
ideally with voluntary or mandatory pension markets. With variations depending upon the specific location, we have targeted these markets for sales of retirement and related products and services,
including mutual funds, asset management, income annuities and life insurance accumulation products to businesses and individuals.

We
have pursued our international strategy through a combination of acquisitions, start-up operations and joint ventures, which require infusions of capital consistent with our strategy
of long-term growth and profitability.

Principal International Segment Summary Financial Data

AUM is generally a key indicator of earnings growth for the segment, as AUM is the base by which we can generate local currency profits. The
Cuprum business in Chile differs in that the majority of fees are collected with each deposit by the mandatory retirement customers, based on a capped salary level, as opposed to asset levels. Net
customer cash flow and market performance are the two main drivers of local currency AUM growth. Net customer cash flow reflects our ability to attract and retain client deposits. Market performance
reflects the investment returns on our underlying AUM. Our financial results are also impacted by fluctuations of the foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for the locations in which we have
business. AUM of our foreign subsidiaries is translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the end of the reporting period using the spot foreign exchange rates. Revenue and expenses for our foreign
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the average foreign exchange rates for the reporting period.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015

Pre-Tax Operating Earnings

Pre-tax operating earnings increased in Asia due to $22.4 million from higher earnings in our equity method investment in China. Pre-tax
operating earnings decreased in Latin America due to $23.8 million from weakening of currencies against the U.S. dollar. This decrease was partially offset by $22.0 million higher
earnings in our equity method investment in Brazil.

Net Revenue

Net revenue increased in Asia due to $24.6 million from higher revenues in Hong Kong following the AXA acquisition in September 2015 and
$22.4 million higher earnings in our equity method investment in China. Net revenue in Latin America decreased due to $36.4 million weakening of currencies against the U.S. dollar and a
$7.4 million unfavorable 2016 impact associated with assumption updates and model refinements in Mexico. These decreases were partially offset by $22.0 million higher earnings in our
equity method investment in Brazil.



Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased in Asia due to $22.0 million growth in Hong Kong following the AXA acquisition in September 2015. Operating
expenses decreased in Latin America due to $23.0 million intangible asset impairments in our mutual fund company in Brazil during third quarter 2015.

Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014

Pre-Tax Operating Earnings

Pre-tax operating earnings decreased in Latin America primarily due to $67.7 million weakening of the currencies against the U.S. dollar,
$19.9 million due to unfavorable relative market changes on our required regulatory investment in the pension funds of our Chilean pension company and $18.5 million from the intangible
asset impairments in our mutual fund company in Brazil in third quarter 2015. These decreases were partially offset by $40.2 million higher earnings in our equity method investment in Brazil.
Pre-tax operating earnings increased in Asia due to $14.2 million higher earnings in our equity method investment in China.

Net Revenue

Net revenue decreased in Latin America due to $119.6 million weakening of currencies against the U.S. dollar and $20.9 million
unfavorable relative market performance on our required regulatory investments in the pension funds of our Chilean pension company. These decreases were partially offset by $40.2 million higher
earnings in our equity method investment in Brazil. Net revenue increased in Asia due to $15.7 million from higher revenues in Hong Kong following the AXA acquisition in September 2015 and
$14.2 million higher earnings in our equity method investment in China.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased in Latin America due to the $23.0 million intangible asset impairments in our mutual fund company in Brazil
in third quarter 2015.

U.S. Insurance Solutions Segment

Several key drivers impact earnings growth in the U.S. Insurance Solutions segment. The ability of our distribution channels to generate new
sales and retain existing business drives growth in our premium and fees. Our earnings growth also depends on our ability to price our products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the
cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products. Factors impacting
pricing decisions include competitive conditions, economic trends, retention, our ability to assess and manage trends in mortality and morbidity and our ability to manage operating expenses.

U.S. Insurance Solutions Insurance Trends

Premium and fees are a key metric for growth in the U.S. Insurance Solutions segment. We receive premiums on our specialty benefits insurance
products as well as our traditional life insurance products. Fees are generated from our specialty benefits fee-for-service products as well as our universal life and variable universal life insurance
products.

Premium
and fees are influenced by economic, industry and regulatory trends. In our specialty benefits insurance business, premium and fees growth is a result of strong retention and
sales, as well as continued in-group growth. In our individual life insurance business, we have intentionally decreased sales of certain interest sensitive products in favor of more traditional
products due to the low interest rate environment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity and capital resources represent the overall strength of a company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at a
competitive rate and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. Our legal entity structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. Following is a simplified
organizational structure.

Liquidity

Our liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be met by funds from consolidated operations as well as the issuance of commercial
paper, common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from credit facilities. We believe the cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements
of our operations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies.

We
maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is believed to be adequate to meet anticipated short-term and
long-term payment obligations. We will continue our prudent capital management practice of regularly exploring options available to us to maximize capital flexibility, including accessing the capital
markets and careful attention to and management of expenses.

We
perform rigorous liquidity stress testing to ensure our asset portfolio includes sufficient high quality liquid assets that could be utilized to bolster our liquidity position under
increasingly stressed market conditions. These assets could be utilized as collateral for secured borrowing transactions with various third parties or by selling the securities in the open market if
needed.

We
also manage liquidity risk by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised against the company at inopportune times. For
example, as of December 31, 2016, approximately $9.5 billion, or 99%, of our institutional guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements cannot be redeemed by contractholders
prior to maturity. Our individual annuity liabilities also contain surrender charges and other provisions limiting early surrenders.

The
following table summarizes the withdrawal characteristics of our domestic general account investment contracts as of December 31, 2016.

Universal
life insurance and certain traditional life insurance policies are also subject to discretionary withdrawals by policyholders. However, life insurance policies tend to be less
susceptible to withdrawal than our investment contracts because policyholders may be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new life insurance policy. In addition, our life
insurance liabilities include surrender charges to discourage early surrenders.

As
of both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had short-term credit facilities with various financial institutions in an aggregate amount of
$1,005.0 million. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $51.4 million and $181.1 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings, with no assets
pledged as support as of December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we extended or renewed $869.0 million of our revolving credit facilities. The facilities and their new
maturity dates include a $400.0 million 5-year facility with PFG, PFS and Principal Life as co-borrowers, of which $20.0 million matures March 2020 and $380.0 million matures
March 2021, a $300.0 million 364-day facility with Principal Life as borrower that matures March 2017 and a $200.0 million 5-year credit



facility,
with PFG, PFS, Principal Life and Principal Financial Services V (UK) LTD as co-borrowers, of which $11.0 million matures March 2020 and $189.0 million matures March
2021. The revolving credit facilities are committed and provide 100% back-stop support for our commercial paper program. The $400.0 million facility is supported by sixteen banks through March
2020, reduced to $380.0 million supported by fifteen banks thereafter; the $300.0 million facility is supported by fifteen banks and the $200.0 million facility is supported by
fifteen banks through March 2020, reduced to $189.0 million supported by fourteen banks thereafter. Most of the banks have other relationships with us. In addition to the revolving credit
facilities, Principal International Chile has the capacity to access up to $60.0 million in unsecured lines of credit offered by Chilean financial institutions and Principal Life has a
$45.0 million unsecured line of credit. Due to the financial strength and the strong relationships we have with these
providers, we are comfortable we have very low risk the financial institutions would be unable or unwilling to fund these facilities.

The Holding Companies: Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Principal Financial Services, Inc.

The principal sources of
funds available
to our parent holding company, PFG, to meet its obligations, including the payments of dividends on common stock, debt service and the repurchase of stock, are dividends from subsidiaries as well as
its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise capital to meet operating and growth needs. The declaration and payment of common stock dividends by us is subject to the discretion of our
Board of Directors and will depend on our overall financial condition, results of operations, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, receipt of dividends from Principal Life (as
described below), risk management considerations and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. No significant restrictions limit the payment of dividends by PFG, except those generally applicable to
corporations incorporated in Delaware. Dividends from Principal Life, our primary subsidiary, are limited by Iowa law.

Under
Iowa law, Principal Life may pay dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of
Iowa ("the Commissioner") to pay stockholder dividends or make any other distribution if such distributions would exceed certain statutory limitations. Iowa law gives the Commissioner discretion to
disapprove requests for distributions in excess of these limits. Extraordinary dividends include those made within the preceding twelve months that exceed the greater of (i) 10% of Principal
Life's statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year-end or (ii) the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year. Based on statutory results for the year ended
December 31, 2016, the dividend limitation for Principal Life is approximately $1,143.3 million in 2017.

In
2016, total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent were $1,175.0 million, of which $650.0 million was extraordinary and approved by the Commissioner.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $1,309.8 million of cash and liquid assets held in our holding companies and other subsidiaries, which is available for corporate purposes. Corporate
balances held in foreign holding companies meet the indefinite reinvestment exception (see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 10, Income Taxes") such that deferred income taxes are not provided as the accumulated earnings would be used offshore and not otherwise repatriated to the U.S.

In
2015, total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent were $504.4 million, all of which were extraordinary and approved by the Commissioner.

In
2014, total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent were $850.0 million, of which $400.0 million was extraordinary and was approved by the
Commissioner.

Operations.

Our primary consolidated cash flow sources are premiums from insurance products, pension and annuity deposits, asset
management fee
revenues, administrative services fee revenues, income from investments and proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments. Cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders
and beneficiaries, income and other taxes, current operating expenses, payment of dividends to policyholders, payments in connection with investments acquired, payments made to acquire subsidiaries,
payments relating to policy and contract surrenders, withdrawals, policy loans, interest payments and repayment of short-term debt and long-term debt. Our investment strategies are generally intended
to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. For a discussion of our investment objectives and strategies, see "Investments."

Cash Flows.

Activity, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, provides relevant information regarding our
sources and uses of cash.
The following discussion of our operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows excludes cash flows attributable to the separate accounts.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $3,857.8 million, $4,377.1 million and $3,102.9 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our
insurance business typically generates positive cash flows from operating activities, as premiums collected from our insurance products and income received from our investments exceed acquisition
costs, benefits paid, redemptions and operating expenses. These positive cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance and investment products and required capital
supporting these products. Our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees and investment income received and benefits and expenses paid. The decrease in cash
provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was the result of fluctuations in receivables and payables associated with the timing of settlements. The increase in cash provided by
operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to growth in the business including higher sales of single premium group annuities and individual annuities with life contingencies.



Net
cash used in investing activities was $5,153.9 million, $3,167.6 million and $1,172.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was the result of increased purchases of available-for-sale securities primarily in the spread businesses. Cash
used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 increased due to higher net purchases of fixed maturity securities and the acquisition of AXA's MPF and ORSO pension business in Hong Kong in
2015.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $1,450.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of
$508.6 million and $2,438.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was the result of net
investment contract deposits in 2016 as compared to net investment contract withdrawals in 2015 primarily due to new issuances in the investment only business in 2016. The increase was partially
offset by the net redemption of long-term debt in 2016 as compared to the net issuance of long-term debt in 2015. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was the
result of decreased net withdrawals of investment contracts and the issuance of long-term debt in 2015. The proceeds of the debt issuance were primarily used for the redemption of preferred stock in
2015.

Shelf Registration.

On May 7, 2014, our shelf registration statement was filed with the SEC and became effective. The shelf
registration
replaced the shelf registration that had been in effect since May 2011. Under our current shelf registration, we have the ability to issue, in unlimited amounts, unsecured senior debt securities or
subordinated debt securities; junior subordinated debt; preferred stock; common stock; warrants; depository shares; stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of PFG; trust preferred securities
of three subsidiary trusts and guarantees by PFG of these trust preferred securities. Our wholly owned subsidiary, PFS, may guarantee, fully and unconditionally or otherwise, our obligations with
respect to any non-convertible securities, other than common stock, described in the shelf registration. For information on senior notes issued from our shelf registration, see Item 8.
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9, Debt."

Short-Term Debt.

For short-term debt information, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to
Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 9, Debt."

Long-Term Debt.

On November 10, 2016, we issued $650.0 million of senior notes, in two tranches. The proceeds from the
issuance of
these notes were used to redeem our notes payable due in 2017 and 2019. On November 18 and December 5, 2016, we used available cash to purchase approximately $94.4 million in
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in 2036. On May 7, 2015, we issued $400.0 million of senior notes and $400.0 million of junior subordinated notes, which are
subordinated to all our senior debt. The proceeds from these notes were used primarily to redeem our series A and series B preferred stock. For additional long-term debt information
regarding these debt issuances, purchases and redemptions, and all outstanding long-term debt, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 9, Debt."

Stockholders' Equity.

On June 30, 2015, we redeemed our 3.0 million shares of series A preferred stock for
$300.0 million
and our 10.0 million shares of series B preferred stock for $250.0 million. Proceeds from the issuance of our common stock were $37.8 million, $76.1 million and
$77.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

obligations exclude short-term liabilities, other policyholder funds, taxes and short-term debt as these are not long-term and/or not contractual in
nature. Contractual obligations also exclude obligations under our pension and OPEB plans as we do not anticipate contributions will be needed to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of ERISA for
our qualified pension plan. In addition, separate account liabilities are excluded. Separate account liabilities represent the fair market value of the assets of the funds that are separately
administered by us. Generally, the separate account contract owner, rather than us, bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account liabilities are legally segregated and are not
subject to claims that arise out of any other business of ours. Net deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are not reflected in
the consolidated statements of operations. The separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets.

(2)

Contractholder
funds include GICs, funding agreements, individual fixed annuities, universal life insurance and other investment contracts. See Item 8.
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8, Insurance Liabilities" for additional information.

Amounts
included in the contractholder funds line item reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. The sum of the cash outflows shown
for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount included in our consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2016. The liability amount in our
consolidated statements of financial position reflects either the account value (in the case of individual fixed annuities, universal life insurance and GICs) or the par value plus accrued interest
and other adjustments (in the case of funding agreements and other investment contracts).

(3)

Amounts
included in the future policy benefits and claims line item reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. The sum of the cash outflows shown
for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount included in our consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2016. The liability amount in our
consolidated statements of financial position reflects estimated cash payments to policyholders, reductions for expected future premiums, assumptions with regard to the timing of cash payments and
discounting for interest.

(4)

For
long-term debt information, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9, Debt."

(5)

Amounts
included in the certificates of deposit line item reflect estimated cash payments to be made, including expected interest payments. Certificates of deposit
are reported with other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position.



(6)

Amounts
included in the other long-term liabilities line item are contractual, non-cancelable and long-term in nature. The total payments primarily relate to savings
deposits as well as premium associated with purchased option contracts where payments are made over the life of the contract. This line item excludes accruals, short-term items and items not
contractual in nature.

(7)

Amounts
included in the capital leases line item represent future minimum lease payments due under capital leases for buildings and hardware storage equipment. For
capital lease information, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12, Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications"
under the caption, "Capital Leases."

(8)

Amounts
included in the operating leases line item represent payments due under various operating leases for office space, data processing equipment and office
furniture and equipment. For operating lease information, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12, Contingencies,
Guarantees and Indemnifications" under the caption, "Operating Leases."

(9)

Purchase
obligations include material contracts where we have a non-cancelable commitment to purchase goods and services in addition to commitments to originate
loans and purchase investments.

Pension and OPEB Plan Funding

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our U.S. employees and certain agents. See Item 8. "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Employee and Agent Benefits" for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

We
report the net funded status of our pension and OPEB plans in the consolidated statements of financial position. The net funded status represents the difference between the fair value
of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension and OPEB plans. The measurement of the net funded status can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and
the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below. The net underfunded status of the pension and OPEB obligation was $346.6 million pre-tax and $424.6 million pre-tax as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Nonqualified pension plan assets are not included as part of the funding status mentioned above. The nonqualified pension plan assets are held in Rabbi
trusts for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. The assets held in a Rabbi trust are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy. Therefore,
these assets are fully consolidated in our consolidated statements of financial position and are not reflected in our funded status as they do not qualify as plan assets under U.S. GAAP.
The market value of assets held in these trusts was $341.0 million and $330.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our
funding policy for the qualified pension plan is to fund the plan annually in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contributions required under ERISA and, generally, not
greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. We do not anticipate contributions will be needed to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of ERISA for our
qualified pension plan. We are unable to estimate the amount that may be contributed, but it is possible that we may fund the plans in 2017 up to $125 million. This includes funding for both
our qualified and nonqualified pension plans. We may contribute to our OPEB plans in 2017 pending further analysis.

Contractual Commitments

In connection with our banking business, we have made commitments to extend credit under home equity lines of credit, which are agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require
payment of a fee. A majority of these lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash funding
requirements. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The total commitments to fund home equity loans were $3.4 million as of December 31, 2016.

We
have made commitments to provide liquidity for certain benefit plans transitioning to us from another provider. As funds from the plans become available, they will be used to pay down
outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of unfunded commitments was $17.0 million.

We
have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships and other funds interests in which we are not the general partner or investment manager. As of December 31, 2016, the
amount of unfunded commitments was $658.1 million. We are only required to fund additional equity under these commitments when called upon to do so by the partnership or fund; therefore, these
commitments are not liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Variable Interest Entities.

We have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and other entities where we
have a variable interest
as described in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Variable Interest Entities." We have made commitments to fund
certain limited partnerships, as previously discussed in "Contractual Commitments", some of which are classified as unconsolidated variable interest entities.

Guarantees and Indemnifications.

As of December 31, 2016, no significant changes to guarantees and indemnifications have
occurred since
December 31, 2015. For guarantee and indemnification information, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12,
Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications" under the caption, "Guarantees and Indemnifications."



Financial Strength and Credit Ratings

Our ratings are influenced by the relative ratings of our peers/competitors as well as many other factors including our operating and financial
performance, capital levels, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), risk exposures, operating leverage and other factors.

In
January 2017, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength ratings of Principal Life and PNLIC at 'A+'. The outlook remains 'stable' for all ratings. The affirmation reflects
continued solid risk-adjusted capitalization, well-managed balance sheet, strong business profile and consistently favorable operating results.

In
November 2016, Moody's affirmed the financial strength ratings of Principal Life and PNLIC at 'A1'. The outlook remains 'stable'. The affirmation is based on the leading, broad-based
position of Principal Life in the U.S. group pension market, with earnings diversification from retail life and annuity businesses.

In
October 2016, Fitch affirmed the financial strength ratings of Principal Life and PNLIC at 'AA–'. The outlook remains 'stable'. The affirmation reflects PFG's strong
capitalization and stable, balanced operating profitability, partially offset by above-average exposure to direct mortgages, structured mortgage securities and direct real estate investments.

In
April 2016, S&P affirmed PFG's credit ratings and the financial strength ratings of Principal Life and PNLIC at 'A+'. The outlook remains 'stable' for all ratings. Principal Life's
enterprise risk management rating was affirmed as 'Strong'. The rating affirmation reflects S&P's view that we are a leading competitor in the U.S. small to midsize 401(k) market, with strong asset
management and insurance solution capabilities, strong competitive position supported by respected brand, diversified and sophisticated product portfolio and positive operating performance.

A.M.
Best, Moody's and Fitch have changed their outlook on the U.S. life insurance sector to 'negative' from 'stable'. Continued low interest rates, an uncertain regulatory environment,
exposure to asset management and international risks and low domestic growth are pressuring the sector. S&P maintains a 'stable' outlook on the U.S. life insurance sector. S&P's view is that insurers
have strong levels of capital that will offset credit quality impacts from the interest rate environment. Any deterioration in capitalization will not be to a level that will impact near-term ratings.

The
following table summarizes our significant financial strength and debt ratings from the major independent rating organizations. The debt ratings shown are indicative ratings.
Outstanding issuances are rated the same as indicative ratings unless otherwise noted. Actual ratings can differ from indicative ratings based on contractual terms. A security rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such a rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating.

Impacts of Income Taxes

For income tax information, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 10, Income Taxes."

Fair Value Measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable
inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety considering factors specific to the asset or liability. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 14, Fair Value Measurements" for further details, including a reconciliation of changes in Level 3 fair value measurements.



As
of December 31, 2016, 41% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 55% were Level 2 and 4% were Level 3. Excluding separate account assets as of
December 31, 2016, 3% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 96% were Level 2 and 1% were Level 3.

As
of December 31, 2015, 39% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 57% were Level 2 and 4% were Level 3. Excluding separate account assets as of
December 31, 2015, 4% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 95% were Level 2 and 1% were Level 3.

Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements

Net assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of
December 31, 2016, were $7,779.6 million as compared to $7,318.6 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to gains on other invested assets and
real estate included in our separate account assets and net purchases of certain structured securities. The increase was partially offset by net sales in our separate accounts assets.

Net
assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of December 31, 2015, were $7,318.6 million
as compared to $6,350.1 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily related to gains on other invested assets and real estate included in our separate account assets.

Investments

We had total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2016, of $228,014.3 million, of which $75,835.5 million were invested
assets. The rest of our total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk; therefore, the discussion and financial information below
does not include such assets.

Overall Composition of Invested Assets

Invested assets as of December 31, 2016, were predominantly high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit,
industry and geographic location. Asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products. As shown in the following table, the major categories of invested
assets are fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans. The remainder is invested in other investments,
equity securities, real estate and residential mortgage loans. In addition, policy loans are included in our invested assets.

Investment Results

Net Investment Income

The following table presents the yield and investment income, excluding net realized capital gains and losses, for our invested assets for the
years indicated. We calculate annualized yields using a simple average of asset classes at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The yields for available-for-sale fixed maturities and
available-for-sale equity



securities
are calculated using amortized cost and cost, respectively. All other yields are calculated using carrying amounts.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015

Net investment income increased primarily due to higher average invested assets in our U.S. operations and an increase in variable investment
income primarily related to the sale of joint venture real estate and certain other real estate. These increases were partially offset by lower investment yields on invested assets in our U.S.
operations.

Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014

Net investment income decreased primarily due to lower investment yields and prepayments on invested assets and cash in our U.S. operations. In
addition, net investment income decreased due to the weakening of the Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar, lower inflation-based investment returns on average invested assets and cash as
a result of lower inflation in Chile and unfavorable relative market performance on our required regulatory investment in the pension funds of our Chilean pension company.

Includes
credit impairments as well as losses on sales of fixed maturities to reduce credit risk, net of realized credit recoveries on the sale of previously
impaired securities. Credit gains on sales, excluding associated foreign currency fluctuations that are included in derivatives and related hedging activities, were a net gain of $0.2 million,
$0.3 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015

Net realized capital losses on fixed maturities, available-for-sale — credit impairments increased primarily due to higher
impairments on corporate fixed maturities in the energy sector and structured fixed maturities.

Net
realized capital gains on fixed maturities, available-for-sale and trading — noncredit increased primarily due to the sale of a long dated structured security in
2016 and gains versus losses on trading securities related to changes in interest rates and credit spreads.

Derivatives
and related hedge activities had net gains in 2016 as compared to net losses in 2015 primarily due to increased gains on interest rate swap derivatives not designated as
hedging instruments due to changes in interest rates. In addition, currency forwards and currency swaps had gains in 2016 versus losses in 2015 due to changes in exchange rates and on credit related
derivatives.



Other
gains (losses) reflected gains in 2016 as compared to losses in 2015 primarily due to a write-off of unamortized book value on corporate owned real estate in 2015 and gains in 2016
versus losses in 2015 on equity securities, trading.

Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014

Net realized capital losses on fixed maturities, available-for-sale — credit impairments decreased primarily due to decreased
losses on structured fixed maturities as a result of improved market conditions. This was partially offset by losses versus gains on corporate fixed maturities.

Net
realized capital gains on fixed maturities, available-for-sale and trading — noncredit decreased primarily due to losses versus gains on trading securities related
to changes in interest rates and credit spreads and a gain from the sale of a long dated structured security in 2014.

Net
realized capital losses on derivatives and related hedge activities increased primarily due to losses versus gains on the GMWB embedded derivative, including changes in the spread
reflecting our own creditworthiness, and related hedging instruments. This was partially offset by decreased losses on credit related derivatives.

Other
gains (losses) reflected losses in 2015 as compared to gains in 2014 primarily due to decreased gains on sales of real estate investments and joint venture real estate and a
write-off of unamortized book value on corporate owned real estate in 2015. This was partially offset by an impairment of Liongate, an equity method investment, in 2014.

U.S. Investment Operations

Of our invested assets, $68,808.2 million were held by our U.S. operations as of December 31, 2016. Our U.S. invested assets are
managed primarily by our Principal Global Investors segment. Our primary investment objective is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters. We seek to protect
policyholders' benefits by optimizing the risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, through asset/liability matching, reducing the credit risk, avoiding high levels of investments that may be
redeemed by the issuer, maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification. We are exposed to two primary sources of investment
risk:

•

credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of an obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest
and

•

interest rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves.

Our
ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. We devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. We manage credit
risk through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. Our Investment Committee, appointed by our Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing all investment policies and approving or
authorizing all investments, except the Executive Committee of the Board must approve any investment transaction exceeding $500.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, eleven members served
on the Investment Committee, one of whom is a member of our Board of Directors. The remaining members were senior management members representing various areas of our company.

We
purchase credit default swaps to hedge certain credit exposures in our investment portfolio and total return swaps and futures to hedge a portion of our investment portfolio from
credit losses. We economically hedged credit exposure in our portfolio by purchasing credit default swaps with a notional amount of $176.5 million and $213.2 million, total return swaps
with a notional of $90.0 million and $90.0 million, and futures with a notional of $11.9 million and $13.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. We sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors when entering into synthetic replicating transactions. When selling credit protection, if there is an event of
default by the referenced name, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security. For further information on credit
derivatives sold, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments" under the caption,
"Credit Derivatives Sold."

We
also seek to manage call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates. We assess and price for call or prepayment risks in all of our investments and monitor these risks
in accordance with asset/liability management policies.

The
amortized cost and weighted average yield, calculated using amortized cost, of non-structured fixed maturity securities that will be callable at the option of the issuer, excluding
securities with a make-whole provision, were $2,075.9 million and 3.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 and $1,554.9 million and 3.9%, respectively, as of
December 31, 2015. In addition, the amortized cost and weighted average yield of residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities, residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and
asset-backed securities — home equity with material prepayment risk were $4,891.3 million and 3.2%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 and $4,391.9 million
and 3.3%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.

Our
Fixed Income Securities Committee, consisting of fixed income securities senior management members, approves the credit rating for the fixed maturities we purchase. Teams of security
analysts, organized by industry, analyze and monitor these investments. In addition, we have teams who specialize in RMBS, CMBS, ABS, municipals and below investment grade securities. Our analysts
monitor issuers held in the portfolio on a continuous basis with a formal review documented annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer. The analysis includes both fundamental and



technical
factors. The fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer. The qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management
aggressiveness of the issuer. In addition, technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap levels are monitored.

Our
Fixed Income Securities Committee also reviews private transactions on a continuous basis to assess the quality ratings of our privately placed investments. We regularly review our
investments to determine whether we should re-rate them, employing the following criteria:

•

material changes in the issuer's revenues or margins;

•

significant management or organizational changes;

•

significant changes regarding the issuer's industry;

•

debt service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry-specific thresholds;

•

violation of financial covenants and

•

other business factors that relate to the issuer.

Our
use of derivatives exposes us to counterparty risk, or the risk that the counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative contract. We actively manage this risk
by:

•

obtaining approval of all new counterparties by the Investment Committee;

•

establishing exposure limits that take into account non-derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure;

•

performing similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long-term basis;

•

diversifying our risk across numerous approved counterparties;

•

implementing credit support annex (collateral) agreements ("CSAs") for over-the-counter derivative transactions or similar agreements with a
majority of our counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures, which provide for netting of exposures;

•

limiting exposure to A credit or better for over-the-counter derivative counterparties without CSAs;

•

conducting stress-test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction;

•

daily monitoring of counterparty credit ratings, exposures and associated collateral levels and

•

trading mandatorily cleared contracts through centralized clearinghouses.

We
manage our exposure on a net basis, whereby we net positive and negative exposures for each counterparty with agreements in place. For further information on derivative exposure, see
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments" under the caption, "Balance Sheet Offsetting."

A
dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. We apply a variety of strategies to minimize credit risk in our
commercial mortgage loan portfolio. When considering new commercial mortgage loans, we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property, make a physical assessment of the underlying security, conduct
a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices. We use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and substantially all existing loans within the portfolio.
The proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns. Our lending guidelines are typically 75% or less loan-to-value ratio and a debt
service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times. We analyze investments outside of these guidelines based on cash flow quality, tenancy and other factors. The following table presents loan-to-value and
debt service coverage ratios for our brick and mortar commercial mortgages, excluding Principal Global Investors segment mortgages:

Our
investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation. In addition, we diversify our product portfolio
offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates. Those features include adjustable crediting rates, policy surrender charges and market
value adjustments on liquidations. For further information on our management of interest rate risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk —
Interest Rate Risk."

We
believe it is desirable to hold residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification characteristics. Our
portfolio is comprised of Government National Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
pass-through securities. In addition, our residential collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio offers structural features that allow cash flows to be matched to our liabilities.

CMBS
provide varying levels of credit protection, diversification and reduced event risk depending on the securities owned and composition of the loan pool. CMBS are predominantly
comprised of large pool securitizations that are diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion. The risks to any CMBS deal are determined by the credit quality of the underlying loans
and how those loans perform over time. Another key risk is the vintage of the underlying loans and the state of the markets during a particular vintage. In the CMBS market, there is a material
difference in the outlook for the performance of loans originated in 2004 and earlier relative to loans originated in 2005 through 2008. For loans originated prior to 2005, underwriting assumptions
were more conservative regarding required debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios. For the 2005 through 2008 vintages, real estate values peaked and the underwriting expectations were that
values would continue to increase, which makes those loan values more sensitive to market declines. The 2009 through 2016 vintages represent a return to debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-value
ratios that more closely resemble loans originated prior to 2005.

We
purchase ABS to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturities portfolio and to provide attractive returns. The principal risks in holding ABS are structural and credit
risks. Structural risks include the security's priority in



the
issuer's capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. Credit risks involve collateral and issuer/servicer risk where
collateral and servicer performance may deteriorate. Our ABS portfolio is diversified both by type of asset and by issuer. We actively monitor holdings of ABS to recognize adverse changes in the risk
profile of each security. Prepayments in the ABS portfolio are, in general, insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated from such changes by call protection features. In the event we are
subject to prepayment risk, we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those ABS. In addition, we hold a diverse class of securities, which limits our exposure
to any one security.

The
international exposure held in our U.S. operation's fixed maturities portfolio was 21% of total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2016 and 22% as of December 31,
2015. It is comprised of corporate and foreign government fixed maturities. The following table presents the carrying amount of our international exposure for our U.S. operation's fixed maturities
portfolio for the years indicated.

Includes
exposure from two countries and various supranational organizations as of both December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015.

International
fixed maturities exposure is determined by the country of domicile of the parent entity of an individual asset. All international fixed maturities held by our U.S.
operations are either denominated in U.S. dollars or have been swapped into U.S. dollar equivalents. Our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment
professionals. We control concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks, which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country. Our investment policy limits total
international fixed maturities investments and we are within those internal limits. Exposure to Canada is not included in our international exposure. As of December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, our investments in Canada totaled $1,604.5 million and $1,310.5 million, respectively.

Fixed Maturities Credit Concentrations.

Fixed Maturities Valuation and Credit Quality.

Valuation techniques for the fixed maturities portfolio vary by security type and
the availability of
market data. The use of different pricing techniques and their assumptions could produce different financial results. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Fair Value Measurements" for further details regarding our pricing methodology. Once prices are determined, they are reviewed by pricing analysts for
reasonableness based on asset class and observable market data. Investment analysts who are familiar with specific securities review prices for reasonableness through direct interaction with external
sources, review of recent trade activity or use of internal models. All fixed maturities placed on the "watch list" are periodically analyzed by investment analysts or analysts that focus on troubled
securities ("Workout Group"). This group then meets with the Chief Investment Officer and the Portfolio Managers to determine reasonableness of prices. The valuation of impaired bonds for which there
is no quoted price is typically based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received. Although we believe these values reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities, the
key assumptions about risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any) and other market factors involve qualitative and unobservable inputs.



The Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") of the NAIC monitors the bond investments of insurers for regulatory capital and reporting purposes and, when required,
assigns securities to one of six categories referred to as NAIC designations. Although NAIC designations are not produced to aid the investment decision making process, NAIC designations may serve as
a reasonable proxy for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations' ("NRSRO") credit ratings for certain bonds. For most corporate bonds, NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds generally
considered investment grade by such rating organizations. Bonds are considered investment grade when rated "Baa3" or higher by Moody's, or "BBB–" or higher by S&P. NAIC designations 3
through 6 include bonds generally referred to as below investment grade. Bonds are considered below investment grade when rated "Ba1" or lower by Moody's, or "BB+" or lower by S&P.

However,
for loan-backed and structured securities, as defined by the NAIC, the NAIC designation is not always a reasonable indication of an NRSRO rating as described below. For CMBS and
non-agency RMBS, Blackrock Solutions undertakes the modeling of those NAIC designations. Other loan-backed and structured securities may be subject to an intrinsic price matrix as provided by the
NAIC. This may result in a final designation being higher or lower than the NRSRO credit rating.

The
following table presents our total fixed maturities by NAIC designation as of the years indicated as well as the percentage, based on fair value, that each designation comprises.

Fixed
maturities included 25 securities with an amortized cost of $397.4 million, gross gains of $22.2 million, gross losses of $8.6 million and a carrying amount of
$411.0 million as of December 31, 2016, that were still pending a review and assignment of a designation by the SVO. Due to the timing of when fixed maturities are purchased, legal
documents are filed and the review by the SVO is completed, we will always have securities in our portfolio that are unrated over a reporting period. In these instances, an equivalent designation is
assigned based on our fixed income analyst's assessment.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities.

As of December 31, 2016, based on amortized cost, 97% of our CMBS portfolio had an
NAIC designation of
1 and 68% was issued during the more conservative underwriting periods prior to 2005 and after 2008.

Fixed Maturities Watch List.

We monitor any decline in the credit quality of fixed maturities through the designation of "problem
securities,"
"potential problem securities" and "restructured securities". We define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities: (i) with principal and/or interest payments in default
or where default is perceived to be imminent in the near term, or (ii) issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities. We define potential
problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal "watch list" for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt
payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured. The decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves
significant subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer. We define restructured securities in our fixed maturity
portfolio as securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered. We determine that
restructures should occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual
cash flows. If the present value of the restructured cash flows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured, a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost basis is
established.

The
following table presents the total carrying amount of our fixed maturities portfolio, as well as its problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities for the years
indicated.

Fixed Maturities Impairments.

We have a process in place to identify securities that could potentially have a credit impairment
that is other than
temporary. This process involves monitoring market events that could impact issuers' credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions and other similar factors.
This process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as
indicators of credit issues.

Each
reporting period, a group of individuals including the Chief Investment Officer, our Portfolio Managers, members of our Workout Group and representatives from Investment Accounting
review all securities to determine whether an other-than-temporary decline in value exists and whether losses should be recognized. The analysis focuses on each issuer's ability to service its debts
in a timely fashion. Formal documentation of the analysis and our decision is prepared and approved by management.

We
consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate- related impairment of a security is other than temporary. Relevant facts and circumstances
considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to
capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events; (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows and (5) our intent to sell
the security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. To the extent we
determine a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. For additional details, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments."



We
would not consider a security with unrealized losses to be other than temporarily impaired when it is not our intent to sell the security, it is not more likely than not that we would
be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost, which may be maturity, and we expect to recover the amortized cost basis. However, we do sell securities under certain
circumstances, such as when we have evidence of a change in the issuer's creditworthiness, when we anticipate poor relative future performance of securities, when a change in regulatory requirements
modifies what constitutes a permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. Sales
generate both gains and losses.

A
number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks and
uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our
assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer, (2) the risk that the economic outlook
will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated
information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not
sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period.

The
net realized loss relating to other-than-temporary credit impairments and credit related sales of fixed maturities was $95.1 million, $30.3 million, and
$83.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

This
exposure is all related to sub-prime mortgage loans.

Of
the $615.6 million in gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2016, $17.7 million in losses were attributed to securities scheduled to mature in one year or
less, $29.4 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between one to five years, $74.0 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between five to ten years,
$302.9 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature after ten years and $191.6 million related to mortgage-backed and other ABS that are not classified by maturity year. As of
December 31, 2016, we were in a $1,328.0 million net unrealized gain position as compared to a $1,070.6 million net unrealized gain position as of December 31, 2015. The
$257.4 million increase in net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2016, can primarily be attributed to tightening of credit spreads, partially offset by an approximate 9
basis point increase in interest rates.

Fixed Maturities Available-for-Sale Unrealized Losses.

We believe our long-term fixed maturities portfolio is well diversified
among industry types
and between publicly traded and privately placed securities. Each year, we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturities. Our current policy is to limit the
percentage of cash flow invested in below investment grade assets to 10% of cash flow.

We
invest in privately placed fixed maturities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable quality
public market securities. Generally, private placements provide broader access to management information, strengthened negotiated protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable,
a higher level of collateral. They are, however, generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets.



The following table presents our fixed maturities available-for-sale by investment grade and below investment grade and the associated gross unrealized gains and
losses, including the other-than-temporary impairment losses reported in AOCI, as of the years indicated.

Mortgage Loans

Mortgage loans consist of commercial mortgage loans on real estate and residential mortgage loans. The carrying amount of our commercial
mortgage loan portfolio was $11,940.5 million and $11,194.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The carrying amount of our residential
mortgage loan portfolio was $680.5 million and $596.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Commercial Mortgage Loans.

We generally report commercial mortgage loans on real estate at cost adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accrual of
discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances.

Commercial
mortgage loans play an important role in our investment strategy by:

•

providing strong risk-adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives;

•

enhancing total returns and

•

providing strategic portfolio diversification.

As
a result, we have focused on constructing a high quality portfolio of mortgages. Our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages originated with conservative loan-to-value ratios,
high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy.

Our
commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties. The mortgage portfolio is comprised primarily of
office properties, apartments, well anchored retail properties and general-purpose industrial properties.

Our
commercial mortgage loan portfolio is diversified by geography and specific collateral property type. Commercial mortgage lending in the state of California accounted for 18% of our
commercial mortgage loan portfolio before valuation allowance as of both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We are, therefore, exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk
of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may affect the region. Like other lenders, we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans. With
respect to California properties, however, we obtain an engineering report specific to each property. The report assesses the building's design specifications, whether it has been upgraded to meet
seismic building codes and the maximum loss that is likely to result from a variety of different seismic events. We also obtain a report that assesses, by building and geographic fault lines, the
amount of loss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio might suffer under a variety of seismic events.

The
typical borrower in our commercial loan portfolio is a single purpose entity or single asset entity. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total number of
commercial mortgage loans outstanding was 840 and 878, of which 55% and 60% were for loans with principal balances less than $10.0 million, respectively. The average loan size of our commercial
mortgage portfolio was $14.2 million and $12.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Commercial Mortgage Loan Credit Monitoring.

For further details on monitoring and management of our commercial mortgage loan
portfolio, see
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments — Mortgage Loan Credit Monitoring."

We
categorize loans that are 60 days or more delinquent, loans in process of foreclosure and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are delinquent as "problem"
loans. Valuation allowances or charge-offs have been recognized on most problem loans. We categorize loans that are delinquent less than 60 days where the default is expected to be cured and
loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are current as "potential problem" loans. The decision whether to classify a loan delinquent less than 60 days as a potential problem
involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower. We categorize loans for which the original note rate
has been reduced below market and loans for which the principal has been reduced as "restructured" loans. We also consider loans that are refinanced more than one year beyond the original maturity or
call date at below market rates as restructured.



The
following table presents the carrying amounts of problem, potential problem and restructured commercial mortgages relative to the carrying amount of all commercial mortgages for the
years indicated.

Commercial Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowance.

The valuation allowance for commercial mortgage loans includes loan specific
reserves for loans that
are deemed to be impaired as well as reserves for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property risk or market specific risk has not been identified but for which we anticipate a
loss may occur. For further details on the commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 4, Investments — Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowance."

Residential Mortgage Loans.

The residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of home equity mortgages with an amortized cost
of
$165.6 million and $218.8 million and first lien mortgages with an amortized cost of $531.9 million and $401.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. The home equity loans are generally second lien mortgages made up of closed-end loans and lines of credit. Non-performing residential mortgage loans, which are
defined as loans 90 days or greater delinquent plus non-accrual loans, totaled $12.2 million and $16.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.

We
establish the residential mortgage loan valuation allowance at levels considered adequate to absorb estimated probable losses within the portfolio based on management's evaluation of
the size and current risk characteristics of the portfolio. Such evaluation considers numerous factors, including, but not limited to net charge-off trends, loss forecasts, collateral values,
geographic location, borrower credit scores, delinquency rates, industry condition and economic trends. The changes in the valuation allowance are reported in net realized capital gains (losses) on
our consolidated statements of operations.

Our
residential mortgage loan portfolio, and in particular our home equity loan portfolio, experienced an increase in loss severity from sustained elevated levels of unemployment along
with continued depressed collateral values beginning in 2010. While these factors continue to drive charge-offs, loss rates overall have stabilized and the home equity loan portfolio balance continues
to decline. The following table represents our residential mortgage loan valuation allowance for the years indicated.

Real Estate

Real estate consists primarily of commercial equity real estate. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying
amount of our equity real estate investment was $1,365.2 million, or 2%, and $1,447.2 million, or 2%, of U.S.



invested
assets, respectively. Our commercial equity real estate is held in the form of wholly owned real estate, real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans and majority owned
interests in real estate joint ventures.

Equity
real estate is categorized as either "real estate held for investment" or "real estate held for sale." Real estate held for investment totaled $1,236.5 million and
$1,280.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairments whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Such impairment adjustments are recorded as net realized capital losses in our consolidated results
of operations. Impairment adjustments recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $0.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively.

The
carrying amount of real estate held for sale was $128.7 million and $166.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Once we
identify a real estate property to be sold and it is probable that it will be sold, we classify the property as held for sale. We establish a valuation allowance subject to periodic revisions, if
necessary, to adjust the carrying value of the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the fair value, less associated selling costs. The change in valuation allowance for the
year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.5 million. There was no change in valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2015.

We
use research, both internal and external, to recommend appropriate product and geographic allocations and changes to the equity real estate portfolio. We monitor product, geographic
and industry diversification separately and together to determine the most appropriate mix.

Equity
real estate is distributed across geographic regions of the country. As of December 31, 2016, our equity real estate portfolio was concentrated in the Pacific (35%), South
Atlantic (19%), East North Central (15%) and West South Central (15%) regions of the United States. By property type, we had a concentration in office (45%) and apartments (25%) as of
December 31, 2016.

Other Investments

Our other investments totaled $2,088.7 million as of December 31, 2016, compared to $1,877.4 million as of
December 31, 2015. Derivative assets accounted for $871.6 million and $659.6 million in other investments as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. The remaining invested assets are primarily related to equity method investments, which include real estate properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners
and sponsored investment funds.

International Investment Operations

Of our invested assets, $7,027.3 million were held by our Principal International segment as of December 31, 2016. The assets are
primarily managed by the local Principal International affiliate. Due to the regulatory constraints in each location, each company maintains its own investment policies. As shown in the following
table, the major category of international invested assets is fixed maturities. The following table excludes invested assets of the separate accounts.

Regulations
in certain locations require investment in the funds we manage. These required regulatory investments are classified as equity securities, trading within our consolidated
statements of financial position, with all mark-to-market changes reflected in net investment income. Our investment is primarily dictated by client activity and all investment performance is retained
by us.



Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk Exposures and Risk Management

Market risk is the risk we will incur losses due to adverse fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to
interest rates, equity markets and foreign currency exchange rates. The active management of market risk is an integral part of our operations. We manage our overall market risk exposure within
established risk tolerance ranges using several approaches, including:

•

rebalancing our existing asset or liability portfolios;

•

controlling the risk structure of newly acquired assets and liabilities and

•

using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets or liabilities or assets expected to be purchased.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises primarily from our
holdings in interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Changes in interest rates impact numerous aspects of our operations, including but not limited to:

•

yield on our invested assets;

•

rate of interest we credit to contractholder account balances;

•

timing of cash flows on assets and liabilities containing embedded prepayment options;

•

cost of hedging our GMWB rider;

•

discount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations;

•

estimated gross profits and the amortization of our DAC asset and related actuarial balances;

•

statutory reserve and capital requirements;

•

asset-based fees earned on the fixed income assets we manage;

•

interest expense on our long-term borrowings;

•

fair value of intangible assets in our reporting units and

•

fair value of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position.

Lower
interest rates generally result in lower profitability in the long-term. Conversely, higher interest rates generally result in higher profitability in the long-term.

Impact of Changes in Long-Term Interest Rate Assumptions

We use long-term interest rate assumptions to calculate reserves, DAC, other actuarial balances and benefit plan obligations in accordance with
U.S GAAP. In setting these assumptions, we consider a variety of factors, including historical experience, emerging trends and future expectations. We evaluate our assumptions on at least an annual
basis. Due to the long-term nature of our assumptions, we generally do not revise our assumptions in response to short-term fluctuations in market interest rates. However, we will consider revising
our assumptions if a significant change occurs in the factors noted above.

A
reduction in our long-term interest rate assumptions may result in increases in our reserves and/or unlocking of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances. For additional information,
see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Deferred
Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances."

In
addition, we have implemented reinsurance transactions utilizing affiliated reinsurers and highly rated third parties to finance a portion of the statutory reserves for our term life
insurance policies and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. We calculate an economic reserve, which represents an estimate of our liability associated with these contracts. The
excess of the required statutory reserve over the economic reserve is secured by financing provided by highly rated third parties. The long-term interest rate assumption is a key input in the
calculation of the economic reserve. A reduction in our long-term interest rate assumption would reduce the portion of the statutory reserve that can be financed through affiliated reinsurers, thus
increasing the amount of invested assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves. For additional information, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Statutory Insurance Financial Information."



Impact of Changes in Interest Rates

Changes in interest rates or a sustained low interest rate environment may result in the following impacts, which would impact our financial
position and results of operations:

Impact of Falling Interest Rates or Sustained Low Interest Rates

Impact of Rising Interest Rates

Adverse Impacts:

Positive Impacts:

A reduction in investment income, which may be partially offset by a reduction in the interest we credit on contractholder account balances; however, our ability to lower crediting rates may be constrained by
guaranteed minimum interest rates and competitive pressures

An increase in investment income, which may be partially or fully offset by an increase in the interest we credit on contractholder account balances

An increase in the cost of hedging our GMWB rider

A decrease in the cost of hedging our GMWB rider

An increase in reserves and/or a true-up or unlocking of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances

A true-up or unlocking of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances

A reduction in the discount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations, leading to an increase in our Projected Benefit Obligation, NPPC, Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation and NPBC

An increase in the discount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations, leading to a decrease in our Projected Benefit Obligation, NPPC, Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation and NPBC

An increase in statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves

A decrease in statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves

An increase in prepayments or redemptions on mortgages and bonds we own, which would force us to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates

Positive Impacts:

Adverse Impacts:

An increase in the value of the fixed income assets we manage, resulting in an increase in our fee revenue in the short-term

A decrease in the value of the fixed income assets we manage, resulting in a decrease in our fee revenue in the short-term

A decrease in the interest expense on our long-term borrowings, to the extent we are able to refinance our obligations at lower interest rates

An increase in the interest expense on our long-term borrowings, to the extent we refinance our obligations at higher interest rates

An increase in the fair value of certain financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position

A decrease in the fair value of certain financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position, as discussed below

A reduction in the fair value of intangible assets in our reporting units, potentially leading to an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets

We
estimate a hypothetical 100 basis point immediate, parallel decrease in interest rates would reduce our segment pre-tax operating earnings by less than 1% over the next
12 months excluding the impact of any potential unlocking of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances. This estimate reflects the impact of routine management actions in response to a drop in
interest rates, such as reducing the interest rates we credit on contractholder account balances; however, it does not reflect the impact of other actions management may consider, such as curtailing
sales of certain products. We anticipate the adverse segment pre-tax operating earnings impacts of a decrease in market interest rates will grow over time as assets mature and we are forced to
reinvest at lower interest rates.

The
selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel decrease in interest rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of
the impact of such an event. Our exposure will change as a result of ongoing portfolio transactions in response to new business, management's assessment of changing market conditions and changes in
our mix of business.

The
segment pre-tax operating earnings sensitivity disclosure above replaces the margin sensitivity that was included in our 2015 Form 10-K. Our previous disclosure reflected the
potential impact of a reduction in market interest rates on our margin of investment income above our interest credited to our liabilities. The sensitivity above reflects the total impact on segment
pre-tax operating earnings for a reduction in market interest rates. We believe the revised disclosure provides a more comprehensive indication of the potential impact of a change in interest rates.

If
market rates increase rapidly, policy surrenders, withdrawals and requests for policy loans may increase as customers seek to achieve higher returns. This may result in unlocking of
our DAC and other actuarial balances. We may be required to sell assets to raise the cash necessary to respond to such surrenders, withdrawals and loans, thereby realizing capital losses on the assets
sold.



Guaranteed Minimum Interest Rate Exposure.

The following table provides detail on the differences between the interest rates
being credited to
contractholders as of December 31, 2016, and the respective guaranteed minimum interest
rates ("GMIRs"). Account values are broken down by GMIR level within the Retirement and Income Solutions and U.S. Insurance Solutions segments.

Includes
only the account values, net of policy loans, for products with GMIRs and discretionary crediting rates.

In
addition to the domestic account values shown in the table above, Principal International had $848.5 million and $566.9 million of account values with GMIRs in Hong Kong
and Brazil, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. The Brazil amount includes account values from an equity method subsidiary, adjusted to reflect the proportion of the subsidiary's results
reflected in our net income. Our liabilities in Principal International are generally denominated in the functional currency of the location of operation. The pattern of interest rate movements in our
international operations will likely differ from the pattern of interest rate movements in the U.S.

Impact of Rising Interest Rates on the Fair Value of Financial Assets.

An increase in market interest rates may cause a decline
in the value of
financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position. Although changes in the fair value of our financial assets due to changes in interest rates may impact the
amount of equity reported in our consolidated statements of financial position, these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments, terminate derivative positions,
determine an investment is other than temporarily impaired, or determine a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge.

We
estimate a hypothetical 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates would reduce the net reported fair value of our financial assets and derivatives by
$3,100.1 million as of December 31, 2016, compared to $2,765.0 million as of December 31, 2015. This estimate only reflects the change in fair value for financial assets
and derivatives reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position. Assets and liabilities not reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial
position — including mortgage loans, liabilities relating to insurance contracts, investment contracts, debt and bank deposits — are excluded from this
sensitivity analysis. We believe the excluded liability items would economically serve as a partial offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial instruments included in the sensitivity
analysis. Separate account assets and liabilities are also excluded from this estimate, as any interest rate risk is borne by the holder of the separate account. For more information on fair value
measurements, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Fair Value Measurements."

Our
selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario we use to demonstrate potential risk. While a 100 basis point immediate,
parallel increase does not represent our view of future market changes, it is a near term reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. While this
sensitivity analysis provides a representation of interest rate sensitivity, it is based on our portfolio exposures at a point in time and may not be representative of future market results. These
exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio transactions in response to new business, management's assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities.

Our
net estimated potential loss in fair value as of December 31, 2016, increased $335.1 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in our invested
assets and an increase in the duration of our financial assets with



interest
rate risk. This was partly offset by an increase in our exposure to pay fixed interest rate swaps due to hedging needs.

The
fair value sensitivity disclosure above represents a revision to the fair value sensitivity disclosure included in our 2015 Form 10-K. Our previous disclosure reflected the
potential change in fair value for all interest rate sensitive financial assets, financial liabilities, and derivatives, including those not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis but required to
be disclosed at fair value. The revised disclosure reflects only the potential change in fair value for financial assets and derivatives reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of
financial position. We believe the revised disclosure provides a clearer indication of the potential impact on our consolidated statements of financial position from a 100 basis point change in
interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk Management

We manage interest rate risk through the use of an integrated risk management framework. This helps us identify, assess, monitor, report and
manage our risks within established limits and risk tolerances. Our internal risk committees monitor and discuss our risk profile and identify necessary actions to mitigate impacts from interest rate
risk.

The
product designs within our business units result in a variety of different interest rate risk profiles. Therefore, our business units use a variety of different approaches for
managing their asset and liability interest rate risks.

•

Retirement Business Stable Cash Flows

— For stable and predictable cash flow
liabilities, such as full service payout, full service accumulation and investment only, we use investment strategy and hedges to tightly align the cash flow run off of these asset and liability cash
flows. Market value immunization and embedded value analysis are also utilized in the management of interest rate risk.

•

Retirement Business Dynamic Cash Flows

— Dynamic liability cash flows, such
as fixed annuities, are sensitive to policyholder behavior and the current interest rate environment. The risk and return metrics from deterministic and stochastic interest rate scenarios are used to
manage the interest rate risk for these liabilities.

•

U.S. Insurance Stable Cash Flows

— Our insurance businesses in many
instances contain long-term guarantees with stable and predictable liability cash flows and recurring premiums. We manage the interest rate risk through duration analysis, investment strategy and
product crediting rates.

•

Principal International

— Our international businesses operate within local
regulations and financial market conditions (e.g., derivative markets, assets available) to achieve similar asset and liability cash flow management objectives. In locations with a limited
availability of long-dated assets and derivative markets, the duration gap is managed to risk tolerances specific to each location.

We
also limit our exposure to interest rate risk through our business mix and strategy. We have intentionally limited our exposure to specific products where investment margins are
critical to the product's profitability, and we continue to emphasize the sale of products that generate revenues in the form of fees for service or premiums for insurance coverage and expose us to
minimal interest rate risk.

Prepayment
risk is controlled by limiting our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. We also require additional yield
on these investments to compensate for the risk the issuer will exercise such option. Prepayment risk is also controlled by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other
options that can be exercised against the company at inopportune times. We manage the interest rate risk associated with our long-term borrowings by monitoring the interest rate environment and
evaluating refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach.

The
plan fiduciaries use a Dynamic Asset Allocation strategy for our qualified defined benefit pension plan, which strategically allocates an increasing portion of the assets of the
pension plan to fixed income securities as the funding status improves. The intended purpose of using the Dynamic Asset Allocation strategy is that the expected change in the value of the plan assets
and the change in pension benefit obligation due to market movements are more likely to have more correlation versus a static allocation of assets between categories. For more information see
Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Benefit
Plans" and Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Employee and Agent Benefits."

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk.

We use or have previously used various derivative financial instruments to manage our
exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, interest rate collars, swaptions and futures. We use interest rate swaps and futures contracts to hedge changes in interest rates
subsequent to the issuance of an insurance liability, such as a guaranteed investment contract, but prior to the purchase of a supporting asset, or during periods of holding assets in anticipation of
near term liability sales. We use interest rate swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities. They can be used to change the sensitivity to the
interest rate of specific assets and liabilities as well as an entire portfolio. We use interest rate collars to manage interest rate risk related to GMIR liabilities in our individual annuities
contracts and lapse risk associated with higher interest rates. We purchase swaptions to offset or modify existing exposures.



Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk arises
from foreign currency-denominated funding agreements issued to nonqualified institutional investors in the international market, foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, and
our international operations, including potential acquisition and divestiture activity.

We
estimate as of December 31, 2016, a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would result in no material change
to the net fair value of our foreign currency-denominated instruments identified above because we effectively hedge foreign currency-denominated instruments to minimize exchange rate impacts, which is
consistent with our estimate as of December 31, 2015. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do affect the translation of segment pre-tax operating earnings and equity of our
international operations into our consolidated financial statements.

For
our Principal International segment, we estimate a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we were exposed would have resulted in a
$306.0 million, or 10%, reduction in the total equity excluding noncontrolling interests of our international operations as of December 31, 2016, as compared to an estimated
$302.8 million, or 10%, reduction as of December 31, 2015. We estimate a 10% unfavorable change in the average foreign currency exchange rates to which we were exposed through our
international operations would have resulted in a $36.0 million, or 13%, reduction in segment pre-tax operating earnings of our international operations for the year ended December 31,
2016, as compared to an estimated $34.2 million, or 13%, reduction for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The
selection of a 10% immediate unfavorable change in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of
the potential impact of such an event. These exposures will change as a result of a change in the size and mix of our foreign operations.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Foreign Currency Risk.

The foreign currency risk on funding agreements and fixed maturities in our U.S.
operations is
mitigated by using currency swaps that swap the foreign currency interest and principal payments to our functional currency. The notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with
foreign-denominated liabilities was $881.1 million and $1,190.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The notional amount of our currency
swap agreements associated with foreign-denominated fixed maturities was $452.8 million and $398.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The
notional amount of our currency forwards hedging foreign-denominated equity securities was $18.9 million and $14.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.

With
regard to our international operations, in order to enhance the diversification of our investment portfolios we may invest in bonds denominated in a currency that is different than
the currency of our liabilities. We use foreign exchange derivatives to economically hedge the currency mismatch. Our Principal International operations had currency swaps with a notional amount of
$218.1 million and $161.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our Principal International operations also utilized currency forwards with a
notional amount of $713.5 million and $1,001.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

We
sometimes use derivatives to manage the foreign currency risk associated with a business combination. We had no hedges of business combinations outstanding as of December 31,
2016 or December 31, 2015. Additionally, from time to time we take measures to hedge currency risk associated with certain net equity investments in or expected cash flows from our foreign
operations. We used currency forwards during 2015 to hedge certain net investments in
foreign operations. Currency forwards were not used for hedging any net investments in foreign operations during 2016. We held currency forwards with a notional amount of $118.9 million and
$24.0 as December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, to hedge expected future cash flows from foreign operations.

Equity Risk

Equity risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in common stock prices. As of December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the fair value of our equity securities was $1,512.3 million and $1,307.2 million, respectively. We estimate a 10% decline in the prices of the equity
securities would result in a decline in fair value of our equity securities of $151.2 million as of December 31, 2016, as compared to a decline in fair value of our equity securities of
$130.7 million as of December 31, 2015.

We
are also exposed to the risk that asset-based fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment prices and the risk that asset management
fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower. The risk of decreased asset-based and asset management fees could also impact our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for
amortizing DAC and other actuarial balances. For further discussion, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Deferred Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances."

We
also have equity risk associated with (1) fixed deferred annuity and universal life contracts that credit interest to customers based on changes in an external equity index;
(2) variable annuity contracts that have a GMWB rider that allows the customer to make withdrawals of a specified annual amount, either for a fixed number of years or for the lifetime of the
customer, even if the account value is reduced to zero; (3) variable annuity contracts that have a



guaranteed
minimum death benefit ("GMDB") that allows the death benefit to be paid, even if the account value has fallen below the GMDB amount and (4) investment contracts in which the return
is subject to minimum contractual guarantees. We are also subject to equity risk based upon the assets that support our employee benefit plans. For further discussion of equity risk associated with
these plans, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates — Benefit Plans."

We
estimate an immediate 10% decline in the S&P 500 index, followed by a 2% per quarter increase would reduce our annual segment pre-tax operating earnings by approximately 4% to
6%. This estimate excludes the impact of any potential unlocking of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances. The selection of a 10% unfavorable change in the S&P 500 index should not be
construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event. Our exposure will change as a result of changes in our mix of business.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Equity Risk.

We economically hedge the fixed deferred annuity and universal life products, where the
interest credited
is linked to an external equity index, by purchasing options that match the product's profile or selling options to offset existing exposures. We economically hedged the GMWB exposure, which includes
interest rate risk and equity risk, using futures, options and interest rate swaps with notional amounts of
$641.1 million, $3,135.0 million, and $3,996.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, and notional amounts of $676.2 million, $3,284.2 million, and
$3,547.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The fair value of both the GMWB embedded derivative and associated hedging instruments are sensitive to financial market
conditions and the variance related to the change in fair value of these items for a given period is largely dependent on market conditions at the end of the period.

on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

We
have audited Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Principal Financial Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on
the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Principal
Financial Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, and our report dated February 8, 2017, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Principal Financial Group, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Principal Financial Group, Inc. at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 8, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2016

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("PFG") is a leader in global investment management offering businesses, individuals and institutional
clients a wide range of financial products and services, including retirement, asset management and insurance through our diverse family of financial services companies.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PFG and all other entities in which we directly or indirectly have a
controlling financial interest as well as those variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which we are the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Consolidation

We have relationships with various special purpose entities and other legal entities that must be evaluated to determine if the entities meet
the criteria of a VIE or a voting interest entity ("VOE"). This assessment is performed by reviewing contractual, ownership and other rights, including involvement of related parties, and requires use
of judgment. First, we determine if we hold a variable interest in an entity by assessing if we have the right to receive expected losses and expected residual returns of the entity. If we hold a
variable interest, then the entity is assessed to determine if it is a VIE. An entity is a VIE if the equity at risk is not sufficient to support its activities, if the equity holders lack a
controlling financial interest or if the entity is structured with non-substantive voting rights. In addition to the previous criteria, if the entity is a limited partnership or similar entity, it is
a VIE if the limited partners do not have the power to direct the entity's most significant activities through substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. A VIE is evaluated to determine the
primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise with (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and
(2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When we are the primary beneficiary, we are
required to consolidate the entity in our financial statements. We reassess our involvement with VIEs on a quarterly basis. For further information about VIEs, refer to Note 3, Variable
Interest Entities.

If
an entity is not a VIE, it is considered a VOE. VOEs are generally consolidated if we own a greater than 50% voting interest. If we determine our involvement in an entity no longer
meets the requirements for consolidation under either the VIE or VOE models, the entity is deconsolidated. Entities in which we have significant management influence over the operating and financing
decisions but are not required to consolidate, other than investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, are reported using the equity method.

Goodwill impairment testing

This authoritative guidance is to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 (which measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying
amount of that goodwill) from the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Entities will continue to have
the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Early adoption is permitted.

January 1, 2020

We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Credit losses

This authoritative guidance requires entities to use a current expected credit loss ("CECL") model to measure impairment for most financial assets that are not recorded at fair value through net income. Under the CECL model, an entity will estimate
lifetime expected credit losses considering available relevant information about historical events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale debt securities. This guidance also
expands the required credit loss disclosures and will be applied using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is
permitted.

January 1, 2020

We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. We believe estimated credit losses under the CECL model will generally result in earlier loss recognition for loans
and other receivables.

Leases

This authoritative guidance requires lessee recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The concept of an operating lease, where the lease assets and liabilities are off balance sheet, is eliminated under the new guidance.
For lessors, the guidance modifies lease classification criteria and accounting for certain types of leases. Other key aspects of the guidance relate to the removal of the current real estate-specific guidance and new presentation and disclosure
requirements. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes certain optional practical expedients that may be elected. Early
adoption is permitted.

January 1, 2019

This guidance will require us to add our operating leases to the balance sheet. We are currently evaluating other impacts this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Definition of a business

This authoritative guidance clarifies the definition of a business to assist with evaluating when transactions involving an integrated set of assets and activities (a "set") should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or
businesses. The guidance requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The
guidance also requires a set to include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output to be considered a business. Lastly, the guidance removes the evaluation of whether a
market participant could replace missing elements and narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in the revenue recognition guidance. The guidance will be applied prospectively. Early application is
permitted in certain circumstances.

We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Financial instruments — recognition and measurement

This authoritative guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The primary focus of this guidance is to supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily
determinable fair values into different categories (trading or available-for-sale) and requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. This guidance requires adoption through a
cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.

January 1, 2018

We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, we do not hold material equity securities accounted for at fair value through other
comprehensive income that will be accounted for at fair value through net income under the updated guidance. This change is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition

This authoritative guidance replaces all general and most industry specific revenue recognition guidance (excluding insurance) currently prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The core principle is that an entity recognizes revenue to reflect the transfer of
a promised good or service to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for that good or service. This guidance also provides clarification on when an entity is a principal or an
agent in a transaction. The guidance may be applied using one of the following two methods: (1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (2) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard
recognized at the date of initial application.

January 1, 2018

We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Only a portion of our revenues are impacted by this guidance because the guidance does not apply to revenue on
contracts accounted for under the financial instruments or insurance contracts standards. Our evaluation process includes, but is not limited to, identifying contracts within the scope of the guidance, reviewing and documenting our accounting for
these contracts, and identifying and determining the accounting for any related contract costs.

Income tax — intra-entity transfers of assets

This authoritative guidance requires entities to recognize current and deferred income tax resulting from an intra-entity asset transfer when the transfer occurs. Prior to issuance of this guidance, U.S. GAAP did not allow recognition of income
tax consequences until the asset had been sold to a third party. This guidance requires adoption through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption with early adoption permitted.

The guidance will be adopted prospectively as indicated by the guidance for each area of change and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

When
we adopt new accounting standards, we have a process in place to perform a thorough review of the pronouncement, identify the financial statement and system impacts and create an
implementation plan among our impacted business units to ensure we are compliant with the pronouncement on the date of adoption. This includes having effective processes and controls in place to
support the reported amounts. Each of the standards listed above is in varying stages in our implementation process based on its issuance and adoption dates. We are on track to implement guidance by
the respective effective dates.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported and disclosed. These estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:

•

the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values;

•

investment impairments and valuation allowances;

•

the fair value of and accounting for derivatives;

•

the deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") and other actuarial balances where the amortization is based on estimated gross profits;

•

the measurement of goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets, finite lived intangible assets and related impairments or amortization, if
any;

•

the liability for future policy benefits and claims;

•

the value of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and

•

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets.

A
description of such critical estimates is incorporated within the discussion of the related accounting policies that follow. In applying these policies, management makes subjective and
complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial
services industries; others are specific to our businesses and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Closed Block

Principal Life Insurance Company ("Principal Life") operates a closed block ("Closed Block") for the benefit of individual participating
dividend-paying policies in force at the time of the 1998 mutual insurance holding company ("MIHC") formation. See Note 6, Closed Block, for further details.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt issues with a maturity date of three months or less when
purchased.

Investments

Fixed maturities include bonds, asset-backed securities ("ABS"), redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities.
Equity securities include mutual funds, common stock, non-redeemable preferred

stock
and required regulatory investments. We classify fixed maturities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading at the time of the purchase and, accordingly, carry them at fair
value. See Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, for methodologies related to the determination of fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to available-for-sale securities, excluding those
in fair value hedging relationships, are reflected in stockholders' equity, net of adjustments associated with DAC and related actuarial balances, derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships and
applicable income taxes. Unrealized gains and losses related to hedged portions of available-for-sale securities in fair value hedging relationships and mark-to-market adjustments on certain trading
securities are reflected in net realized capital gains (losses). Mark-to-market adjustments related to certain securities carried at fair value with an investment objective to realize economic value
through mark-to-market changes are reflected in net investment income.

The
cost of fixed maturities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, both computed using the interest method. The cost of fixed maturities and equity
securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for declines in value that are other than temporary. Impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary are primarily reported in net income
as a component of net realized capital gains (losses), with noncredit impairment losses for certain fixed maturities, available-for-sale reported in other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Interest
income, as well as prepayment fees and the amortization of the related premium or discount, is reported in net investment income. For loan-backed and structured securities, we recognize income using a
constant effective yield based on currently anticipated cash flows.

Real
estate investments are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. The initial cost bases of properties acquired through loan foreclosures are the lower of the fair market
values of the properties at the time of foreclosure or the outstanding loan balance. Buildings and land improvements are generally depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life of improvements and tenant improvement costs are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of the related lease. We recognize impairment losses for properties when indicators of
impairment are present and a property's expected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the property's carrying value. In such cases, the cost basis of the properties are reduced to
fair value. Real estate expected to be disposed is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with valuation allowances established accordingly and depreciation no longer
recognized. The carrying amount of real estate held for sale was $130.7 million and $169.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Any impairment losses and any
changes in valuation allowances are reported in net income.

Commercial
and residential mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of
valuation allowances. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate. Interest income, as well as prepayment of fees and the amortization
of the related premium or discount, is reported in net investment income. Any changes in the valuation allowances are reported in net income as net realized capital gains (losses). We measure
impairment based upon the difference between carrying value and estimated value less cost to sell. Estimated value is based on either the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral. If foreclosure is probable, the measurement of any valuation allowance is based upon the fair value of
the collateral.

Net
realized capital gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on the basis of specific identification. In general, in addition to realized capital gains and losses on
investment sales and periodic settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges, we report gains and losses related to the following in net realized capital gains (losses): other-than-temporary
impairments of securities and subsequent realized recoveries, mark-to-market adjustments on certain trading securities, mark-to-market adjustments on sponsored investment funds, fair value hedge and
cash flow hedge ineffectiveness, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in the mortgage loan valuation allowance provision, impairments of real estate held for
investment and impairments of equity method investments. Investment gains and losses on sales of certain real estate held for sale due to investment strategy and mark-to-market adjustments on certain
securities carried at fair value with an investment objective to realize economic value through mark-to-market changes are reported as net investment income and are excluded from net realized capital
gains (losses).

Policy
loans and certain other investments are reported at cost. Interests in unconsolidated entities, joint ventures and partnerships are generally accounted for using the equity
method. We have other investments reported at fair value or for which the fair value option has been elected. See Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, for detail on these investments.

Derivatives

Overview

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of
securities. Derivatives generally used by us include interest rate swaps, interest rate options, swaptions, currency swaps, currency forwards, equity options, futures, credit default swaps and total
return swaps. Derivative positions are either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position and are measured at fair value, generally by obtaining quoted market prices or
through the use of pricing models. See Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, for policies related to the determination of fair value. Fair values can be affected by changes in interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, financial indices, values of securities, credit spreads, and market volatility and liquidity.

Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation

We designate derivatives as either:

(a)

a
hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, including those denominated in a foreign
currency ("fair value hedge");

(b)

a
hedge of a forecasted transaction or the exposure to variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability, including those
denominated in a foreign currency ("cash flow hedge");

(c)

a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation or

(d)

a
derivative not designated as a hedging instrument.

Our
accounting for the ongoing changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the designation, as described above, and is determined when the
derivative contract is entered into or at the time of redesignation. Hedge accounting is used for derivatives that are specifically designated in advance as hedges and that reduce our exposure to an
indicated risk by having a high correlation between changes in the value of the derivatives and the items being hedged at both the inception of the hedge and throughout the hedge period.

Fair Value Hedges.

When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its
fair value, along
with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset, liability or firm commitment
attributable to the hedged risk, are reported in net realized capital gains (losses). Any difference between the net change in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item represents hedge
ineffectiveness.

Cash Flow Hedges.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its
fair value are
recorded as a component of OCI. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in net income. At the time the variability of cash flows being hedged impacts net income, the related portion of
deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument is reclassified and reported in net income.

Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Hedge.

When a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,
its change in fair
value, to the extent effective as a hedge, is recorded as a component of OCI. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in net income. If the foreign operation is sold or upon complete or
substantially complete liquidation, the deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reclassified into net income.

Non-Hedge Derivatives.

If a derivative does not qualify or is not designated for hedge accounting, all changes in fair value are
reported in net
income without considering the changes in the fair value of the economically associated assets or liabilities.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing.

At inception, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as
well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes associating all derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges with
specific assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position or with specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at
inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Even if a derivative is highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, the hedge might have some ineffectiveness.

We
use qualitative and quantitative methods to assess hedge effectiveness. Qualitative methods may include monitoring changes to terms and conditions and counterparty credit ratings.
Quantitative methods may include statistical tests including regression analysis and minimum variance and dollar offset techniques.



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

December 31, 2016

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

Termination of Hedge Accounting.

We prospectively discontinue hedge accounting when (1) the criteria to qualify for hedge
accounting is no
longer met, e.g., a derivative is determined to no longer be highly effective in offsetting the change in fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; (2) the derivative expires, is sold,
terminated or exercised or (3) we remove the designation of the derivative being the hedging instrument for a fair value or cash flow hedge.

If
it is determined that a derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried on the consolidated statements of financial position at its
fair value, with changes in fair value recognized prospectively in net realized capital gains (losses). The asset or liability under a fair value hedge will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair
value pursuant to hedging rules and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to the consolidated statements of operations line associated with the asset or liability. The component of accumulated
other comprehensive income ("AOCI") related to discontinued cash flow hedges that are no longer highly effective is amortized to the consolidated statements of operations consistent with the net
income impacts of the original hedged cash flows. If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is probable the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the deferred gain or loss is immediately
reclassified from AOCI into net income.

Embedded Derivatives.

We purchase and issue certain financial instruments and products that contain a derivative that is
embedded in the financial
instrument or product. We assess whether this embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the asset or liability that serves as its host contract. If we deem that the embedded derivative's
terms are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the derivative is bifurcated from that contract
and held at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial position, with changes in fair value reported in net income.

Contractholder and Policyholder Liabilities

Contractholder and policyholder liabilities (contractholder funds, future policy benefits and claims and other policyholder funds) include
reserves for investment contracts, individual and group annuities that provide periodic income payments, universal life, term life insurance, participating traditional individual life insurance, group
life insurance, health insurance and disability income policies, as well as a provision for dividends on participating policies.

Investment
contracts are contractholders' funds on deposit with us and generally include reserves for pension and annuity contracts. Reserves on investment contracts are equal to the
cumulative deposits less any applicable charges and withdrawals plus credited interest. Reserves for universal life insurance contracts are equal to cumulative deposits less charges plus credited
interest, which represents the account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders.

We
hold additional reserves on certain long-duration contracts where benefit features result in gains in early years followed by losses in later years, universal life/variable universal
life contracts that contain no lapse guarantee features, or annuities with guaranteed minimum death benefits.

Reserves
for individual and group annuities that provide periodic income payments, nonparticipating term life insurance and disability income contracts are computed on a basis of assumed
investment yield, mortality, morbidity and expenses, including a provision for adverse deviation, which generally varies by plan, year of issue and policy duration. Investment yield is based on our
experience. Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rate assumptions are based on our experience and are periodically reviewed against both industry standards and experience.

Reserves
for participating life insurance contracts are based on the net level premium reserve for death and endowment policy benefits. This net level premium reserve is calculated based
on dividend fund interest rates and mortality rates guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in the contract.

Participating
business represented approximately 8%, 9% and 11% of our life insurance in force and 33%, 36% and 40% of the number of life insurance policies in force as of
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Participating business represented approximately 31%, 36% and 40% of life insurance premiums for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014, respectively. The amount of dividends to policyholders is declared annually by Principal Life's Board of Directors. The amount of dividends to be paid to policyholders is determined after
consideration of several factors including interest, mortality, morbidity and other expense experience for the year and judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by
Principal Life. At the end of the reporting period, Principal Life establishes a dividend liability for the pro rata portion of the dividends expected to be paid on or before the next policy
anniversary date.

Some
of our policies and contracts require payment of fees or other policyholder assessments in advance for services that will be rendered over the estimated lives of the policies and
contracts. These payments are established as unearned revenue liabilities upon receipt and included in other policyholder funds in the consolidated statements of financial

position.
These unearned revenue reserves are amortized to operations over the estimated lives of these policies and contracts in relation to the emergence of estimated gross profits ("EGPs").

The
liability for unpaid claims for both long-duration and short-duration contracts is an estimate of the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported losses not yet settled. This
liability is estimated using actuarial analyses and case basis evaluations. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, we believe the liability for unpaid claims is adequate.
These estimates are continually reviewed and, as adjustments to this liability become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in net income. Our liability for unpaid claims does not include any
allocated claim adjustment expenses.

We
incur claim adjustment expenses for both long-duration and short-duration contracts that cannot be allocated to a specific claim. Our claim adjustment expense liability is estimated
using actuarial analyses based on historical trends of expenses and expected claim runout patterns.

Short-Duration Contracts

We include the following group products in our short-duration insurance contracts disclosures: long-term disability ("LTD"), group life waiver,
dental, vision, short-term disability ("STD") and group life.

Future
policy benefits and claims include reserves for group life and disability insurance that provide periodic income payments. These reserves are computed using assumptions of
mortality, morbidity and investment performance. These assumptions are based on our experience, industry results, emerging trends and future expectations. Future policy benefits and claims also
include reserves for incurred but unreported group disability, dental, vision and life insurance claims. We recognize claims costs in the period the service was provided to our policyholders. However,
claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive, process and pay the claims. We determine the amount of this liability using actuarial methods based on
historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging cost trends, where applicable, to determine our estimate of claim liabilities.

We
have defined claim frequency as follows for each short-duration product:

•

LTD: Claim frequency is based on submitted reserve claim counts.

•

Group Life Waiver: Claim frequency is based on submitted reserve claim counts, consistent with LTD.

•

Dental and Vision: Claim frequency is based on the claim form, which may include one or more procedures.

•

STD: Claim frequency is based on submitted claims.

•

Group Life: Claim frequency is based on submitted life claims (lives, not coverages).

We
did not make any significant changes to our methodologies or assumptions used to calculate the liability for unpaid claims for short-duration contracts during 2016.

Recognition of Premiums and Other Considerations, Fees and Other Revenues and Benefits

Traditional individual life insurance products include those products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits and consist principally of
whole life and term life insurance policies. Premiums from these products are recognized as premium revenue when due. Related policy benefits and expenses for individual life products are associated
with earned premiums and result in the recognition of profits over the expected term of the policies and contracts.

Immediate
annuities with life contingencies include products with fixed and guaranteed annuity considerations and benefits and consist principally of group and individual single premium
annuities with life contingencies. Annuity considerations from these products are recognized as premium revenue. However, the collection of these annuity considerations does not represent the
completion of the earnings process, as we establish annuity reserves using estimates for mortality and investment assumptions, which include provision for adverse deviation as required by
U.S. GAAP. We anticipate profits to emerge over the life of the annuity products as we earn investment income, pay benefits and release reserves.

Group
life and health insurance premiums are generally recorded as premium revenue over the term of the coverage. Certain group contracts contain experience premium refund provisions
based on a pre-defined formula that reflects their claim experience. Experience premium refunds reduce revenue over the term of the coverage and are adjusted to reflect current experience. Related
policy benefits and expenses for group life and health insurance products are associated with earned premiums and result in the recognition of profits over the term of the policies and contracts.

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

Fees
for contracts providing claim processing or other administrative services are recorded as revenue over the period the service is provided.

Universal
life-type policies are insurance contracts with terms that are not fixed. Amounts received as payments for such contracts are not reported as premium revenues. Revenues for
universal life-type insurance contracts consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy initiation and administration, surrender charges and other fees that have been assessed against
policy account values and investment income. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include interest credited to contracts and benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of
related policy account balances.

Investment
contracts do not subject us to significant risks arising from policyholder mortality or morbidity and consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs"), funding
agreements and certain deferred annuities. Amounts received as payments for investment contracts are established as investment contract liability balances and are not reported as premium revenues.
Revenues for investment contracts consist of investment income and policy administration charges. Investment contract benefits that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period
in excess of related investment contract liability balances and interest credited to investment contract liability balances.

Fees
and other revenues are earned for asset management services provided to retail and institutional clients based largely upon contractual rates applied to the market value of the
client's portfolio. Additionally, fees and other revenues are earned for administrative services performed including recordkeeping and reporting services for retirement savings plans. Fees and other
revenues received for performance of asset management and administrative services are recognized as revenue when earned, typically when the service is performed.

Fees
for managing customers' mandatory retirement savings accounts in Chile are collected with each monthly deposit made by our customers. If a customer stops contributing before
retirement age, we collect no fees but services are still provided. We recognize revenue from these long-term service contracts as services are performed over the life of the contract.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

Incremental direct costs of contract acquisition as well as certain costs directly related to acquisition activities (underwriting, policy
issuance and processing, medical and inspection and sales force contract selling) for the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and investment contract business are capitalized
to the extent recoverable. Commissions and other incremental direct costs for the acquisition of long-term service contracts are also capitalized to the extent recoverable. Maintenance costs and
acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to net income as incurred.

DAC
for universal life-type insurance contracts and certain investment contracts are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs or, in certain circumstances, estimated
gross revenues. This amortization is adjusted in the current period when EGPs or estimated gross revenues are revised. For individual variable life insurance, individual variable annuities and group
annuities that have separate account U.S. equity investment options, we utilize a mean reversion methodology (reversion to the mean assumption), a common industry practice, to determine the future
domestic equity market growth rate assumption used for the calculation of EGPs. DAC for participating life insurance policies are amortized in proportion to estimated gross margins. DAC for
non-participating term life insurance and individual disability policies are amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing
policyholder liabilities.

DAC
on insurance policies and investment contracts are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event
occurs that may warrant loss recognition. If loss recognition or impairment is necessary, DAC would be written off to the extent it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or
gross profits are not adequate to cover related losses and expenses.

DAC
for long-term service contracts are amortized in proportion to the revenue recognized or straight-line if no pattern of revenue recognition can be reasonably predicted. We amortize
capitalized costs of long-term service contracts on a straight-line basis, reflecting lapses as they are incurred, over the expected contract life.

Deferred Acquisition Costs on Internal Replacements

All insurance and investment contract modifications and replacements are reviewed to determine if the internal replacement results in a
substantially changed contract. If so, the acquisition costs, sales inducements and unearned

revenue
associated with the new contract are deferred and amortized over the lifetime of the new contract. In addition, the existing DAC, sales inducement costs and unearned revenue balances
associated with the replaced contract are written off. If an internal replacement results in a substantially unchanged contract, the acquisition costs, sales inducements and unearned revenue
associated with the new contract are immediately recognized in the period incurred. In addition, the existing DAC, sales inducement costs or unearned revenue balance associated with the replaced
contract is not written off, but instead is carried over to the new contract.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt includes notes payable, nonrecourse mortgages and other debt with a maturity date greater than one year at the date of issuance.
Current maturities of long-term debt are classified as long-term debt in our consolidated statements of financial position.

Reinsurance

We enter into reinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal course of business in order to limit losses and minimize exposure to
significant risks. We may assume reinsurance from or cede reinsurance to other companies. Assets and liabilities related to reinsurance ceded are reported on a gross basis. Premiums and expenses are
reported net of reinsurance ceded. The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with
those used to account for the underlying policies. We are contingently liable with respect to reinsurance ceded to other companies in the event the reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations it has
assumed. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $412.8 million and $397.5 million of net ceded reinsurance recoverables related to claims that have been received, respectively.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $390.5 million, or 95%, and $379.4 million, or 95%, were with our five largest ceded reinsurers, respectively. Our total amount recoverable from
reinsurers includes net ceded reinsurance recoverables related to claims that have been received and reserves ceded to reinsurers; however, it does not reflect potentially offsetting impacts of
collateral. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total amount recoverable from reinsurers was $837.1 million and $857.3 million, respectively.

The
effects of reinsurance on premiums and other considerations and policy and contract benefits were as follows:

Separate Accounts

The separate accounts are legally segregated and are not subject to the claims that arise out of any of our other business. The client, rather
than us, directs the investments and bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account assets represent the fair value of funds that are separately administered by us for contracts with
equity, real estate and fixed income investments and are presented as a summary total within the consolidated statements of financial position. An equivalent amount is reported as separate account
liabilities, which represent the obligation to return the monies to the client. We receive fees for mortality, withdrawal and expense risks, as well as administrative, maintenance and investment
advisory services that are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Net deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses of the separate accounts are
not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

December 31, 2016

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)

Separate account assets and separate account liabilities include certain international retirement accumulation products where the segregated funds and associated obligation to the client
are consolidated within our financial statements. We have determined that summary totals are the most meaningful presentation for these funds.

As
of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the separate accounts included a separate account valued at $158.4 million and $158.2 million, respectively,
which primarily included shares of our stock that were allocated and issued to eligible participants of qualified employee benefit plans administered by us as part of the policy credits issued under
our 2001 demutualization. These shares are included in both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. In the consolidated statements of financial position, the separate account shares are
recorded at fair
value and are reported as separate account assets with a corresponding separate account liability to eligible participants of the qualified plan. Changes in fair value of the separate account shares
are reflected in both the separate account assets and separate account liabilities and do not impact our results of operations.

Income Taxes

We file a U.S. consolidated income tax return that includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns
in all states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our policy of allocating income tax expenses and benefits to companies in the group is generally based upon pro rata contribution
of taxable income or operating losses. We are taxed at corporate rates on taxable income based on existing tax laws. Current income taxes are charged or credited to net income based upon amounts
estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences in the financial reporting
and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards using enacted income tax rates and laws. The effect on deferred income tax assets and
deferred income tax liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in net income in the period in which the change is enacted.

Foreign Exchange

Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates denominated in non-U.S. dollars, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional
currency, are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of stockholders' equity, along with any
related hedge and tax effects. Revenues and expenses for these entities are translated at the average exchange rates. Revenue, expense and other foreign currency transaction and translation
adjustments that affect cash flows are reported in net income, along with related hedge and tax effects.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets recorded
in connection with acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. Rather, they are tested for impairment during the third quarter each year, or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is a business one level below the operating segment, if financial
information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, it is no longer associated with a particular acquisition; therefore,
all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support the goodwill value. Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of
a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.

Intangible
assets with a finite useful life are amortized as related benefits emerge and are reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment in value. If facts and circumstances
suggest possible impairment, the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is compared to the current carrying value of the asset. If the
undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of assets over their fair value.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period and excludes the dilutive effect of equity awards. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities, such as
options and non-vested stock grants, were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.

On
September 1, 2015, we completed our purchase of AXA's Mandatory Provident Fund ("MPF") and Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance ("ORSO") pension business in Hong Kong for
$335.5 million. As part of the transaction, we entered into an exclusive 15-year distribution agreement with AXA to provide co-branded pension products through AXA's extensive agency network in
Hong Kong. AXA's MPF and ORSO pension business is consolidated within our Principal International segment with a portion of the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets allocated to our Principal
Global Investors segment.

Of
the acquired intangible assets, $104.8 million was assigned to goodwill and is not subject to amortization. The goodwill is largely related to future sales anticipated from our
internal workforce and entity-specific revenue synergies that will be generated by combining AXA's MPF and ORSO pension business with our existing businesses. This goodwill will be tested annually as
part of the Principal International Hong Kong reporting unit and the Principal Global Investors Equity Investments and Fixed Income Investments reporting units.

Of
the remaining acquired intangible assets, $138.0 million was assigned to customer relationships, which are subject to amortization over a 30-year useful life, and
$53.0 million was assigned to the distribution agreement, which is subject to amortization over a 15-year useful life based on its contractual term.

Finite Lived Intangible Assets

During
2015, we recorded an $8.3 million pre-tax impairment loss in operating expenses related to finite lived intangible assets that originated from the acquisition of our mutual
fund company in Brazil with a gross carrying amount of $11.5 million and $3.2 million of accumulated amortization at the time of impairment. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we fully
amortized other finite lived intangible assets of $2.2 million, $0.5 million and $118.6 million, respectively.

The
amortization expense for intangible assets with finite useful lives was $44.5 million, $42.5 million and $49.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As
of December 31, 2016, the estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows (in millions):

Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets

The 2015 net impact of impairments of indefinite lived intangibles of our mutual fund company in Brazil resulted in a pre-tax loss of
$14.7 million that was recorded in operating expenses.

The
net carrying amount of unamortized indefinite lived intangible assets was $797.8 million and $790.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of
both December 31, 2016 and 2015, $608.0 million relates to investment management contracts associated with our acquisition of WM Advisors, Inc. in 2006. The remaining balance
primarily relates to the trade name intangible associated with our acquisition of Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones Cuprum S.A. in 2013.

3. Variable Interest Entities

We have relationships with various types of entities which may be VIEs. Certain VIEs are consolidated in our financial results. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant
Accounting Policies, under the caption "Consolidation" for further details of our consolidation accounting policies. We did not provide financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs for
the periods ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Adoption of New Consolidation Guidance

Both the variable interest and voting interest consolidation models were changed under authoritative guidance effective January 1, 2016.
The guidance eliminated the investment company deferral for portions of the variable interest model. Prior to January 1, 2016, the primary beneficiary of an investment company VIE was the
enterprise who absorbed the majority of the entity's expected losses, received a majority of the expected residual returns or both. The new guidance requires all VIEs to be assessed under one method
to determine the primary beneficiary.

The
determination of whether interests in limited partnerships and similar entities are VIEs or VOEs has also changed under the pronouncement, by requiring evaluation of the equity
holders' rights to determine if they have the power to direct the entity's most significant activities through substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. Limited partnerships and similar
entities without these rights are VIEs.

We
adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2016. Under the modified retrospective approach, the cumulative effect of initially applying
the new guidance is recognized as of the date of initial application, and comparative periods are not restated. The changes resulting from the adoption were:

•

The adoption resulted in the deconsolidation of $8.6 billion of both assets and liabilities of certain mandatory privatized social
security funds in which we provide asset management services. Prior to January 1, 2016, the funds were consolidated as VOEs and the funds were presented in separate account assets and
liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. The deconsolidation did not have a material impact to our consolidated statements of operations and did not result in a cumulative
effect of the change on retained earnings.

•

The adoption of the guidance resulted in consolidation of certain sponsored investment funds in which we provide asset management services. We
consolidated $180.1 million of assets and $0.6 million of liabilities. Additionally, we recorded $179.5 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest related to these funds. The
consolidation of these funds did not have a material impact to our consolidated statements of operations and did not result in a cumulative effect of the change on retained earnings.

•

We invest in partnerships and other funds. Prior to new accounting guidance certain of these investments were VOEs. Upon adoption of new
accounting guidance, some of these investments are now considered VIEs. We are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.

•

We provide asset management and other services to certain investment structures for which we earn performance-based management fees. These
structures were considered VIEs prior to new accounting guidance, and we had a variable interest. We were not the primary beneficiary of these entities as we did not have the obligation to absorb
losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be potentially significant to the VIE. Subsequent to new accounting guidance, we no longer consider our fees a variable interest for
those investment structures where our fees are deemed to be commensurate with the services provided, consistent with fees for similar services negotiated at arms-length, and we do not have additional
interests in the entity that would absorb a significant amount of the entity's expected losses and expected residual returns of the entity.

3. Variable Interest Entities — (continued)

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

Grantor Trusts

We contributed undated subordinated floating rate notes to three grantor trusts. The trusts separated their cash flows by issuing an
interest-only certificate and a residual certificate related to each note contributed. Each interest-only certificate entitles the holder to interest on the stated note for a specified term, while the
residual certificate entitles the holder to interest payments subsequent to the term of the interest-only certificate and to all principal payments. We retained the interest-only certificates and the
residual certificates were subsequently sold to third parties. We have determined these grantor trusts are VIEs due to insufficient equity to sustain them. We determined we are the primary beneficiary
as a result of our contribution of securities into the trusts and our significant continuing interest in the trusts.

Collateralized Private Investment Vehicles

We invest in cash and synthetic collateralized debt obligations, collateralized bond obligations, collateralized loan obligations and other
collateralized structures, which are VIEs due to insufficient equity to sustain the entities (collectively known as "collateralized private investment vehicles"). The performance of the notes of these
synthetic structures is primarily linked to a synthetic portfolio by derivatives; each note has a specific loss attachment and detachment point. The notes and related derivatives are collateralized by
a pool of permitted investments. The investments are held by a trustee and can only be liquidated to settle obligations of the trusts. These obligations primarily include derivatives and the notes due
at maturity or termination of the trusts. We determined we are the primary beneficiary for one of these synthetic entities because we act as the investment manager of the underlying portfolio and we
have the power to make decisions and to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

We sold commercial mortgage loans to a real estate mortgage investment conduit trust. The trust issued various commercial mortgage-backed
securities ("CMBS") certificates using the cash flows of the underlying commercial mortgages it purchased. This is considered a VIE due to insufficient equity to sustain itself. We have determined we
are the primary beneficiary as we retained the special servicing role for the assets within the trust as well as the ownership of the bond class that controls the unilateral kick-out rights of the
special servicer.

Mandatory Retirement Savings Funds

We hold an equity interest in Chilean mandatory privatized social security funds in which we provide asset management services. We determined
that the mandatory privatized social security funds, which also include contributions for voluntary pension savings, voluntary non-pension savings and compensation savings accounts, are VIEs. This is
because the equity holders as a group lack the power, due to voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance
and also because equity investors are protected from below-average market investment returns relative to the industry's return, due to a regulatory guarantee that we provide. Further we concluded that
we are the primary beneficiary through our power to make decisions and our significant variable interest in the funds. The purpose of the funds, which reside in legally segregated entities, is to
provide long-term retirement savings. The obligation to the customer is directly related to the assets held in the funds and, as such, we present the assets as separate account assets and the
obligation as separate account liabilities within our consolidated statements of financial position.

Principal
International Hong Kong offers retirement pension schemes in which we provide trustee, administration and asset management services to employers and employees under the Hong
Kong MPF and ORSO pension schemes. Each pension scheme has various guaranteed and non-guaranteed constituent funds, or investment options, in which customers can invest their money. The guaranteed
funds provide either a guaranteed rate of return to the customer or a minimum guarantee on withdrawals under certain qualifying events. We have determined the guaranteed funds are VIEs due to the fact
the equity holders, as a group, lack the obligation to absorb expected losses due to the guarantee we provide. We concluded that we are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to make
decisions and to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
Therefore, we consolidate the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds and present as separate accounts or within the general account, depending on the terms of the guarantee.



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

December 31, 2016

3. Variable Interest Entities — (continued)

Real Estate

We invest in several real estate limited partnerships and limited liability companies. The entities invest in real estate properties. Certain of
these entities are VIEs based on the combination of our significant economic interest and related voting rights. We determined we are the primary beneficiary as a result of our power to control the
entities through our significant ownership. Due to the nature of these real estate investments, the investment balance will fluctuate as we purchase and sell interests in the entities and as capital
expenditures are made to improve the underlying real estate.

Sponsored Investment Funds

We sponsor and invest in certain investment funds for which we provide asset management services. Although our asset management fee is
commensurate with the services provided and consistent with fees for similar services negotiated at arms-length, we have a variable interest for funds where our other interests are more than
insignificant. The funds are VIEs as the equity holders lack power through voting rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance. We determined
we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs where our interest in the entity is more than insignificant and we are the asset manager.

Assets and Liabilities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

The carrying amounts of our consolidated VIE assets, which can only be used to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs, and liabilities of
consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse were as follows:

The
assets of grantor trusts are primarily fixed maturities, available-for-sale. The liabilities are primarily other liabilities that reflect an embedded derivative
of the forecasted transaction to deliver the underlying securities.

(2)

The
assets of the collateralized private investment vehicles are primarily fixed maturities, trading. The liabilities include derivative liabilities and an
obligation to redeem notes at maturity or termination of the trusts, which are reported in other liabilities.

(3)

The
assets of the mandatory retirement savings funds include separate account assets and equity securities, trading. The liabilities include separate account
liabilities and contractholder funds.

(4)

The
assets of the real estate VIEs primarily include real estate, other investments and cash. Liabilities primarily include other liabilities. Liabilities also
included long-term debt as of December 31, 2015.

(5)

The
assets of sponsored investment funds are primarily fixed maturities and equity securities reported in other investments and cash. The consolidated statements of
financial position included a $58.8 million redeemable noncontrolling interest for sponsored investment funds as of December 31, 2016.

Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

Invested Securities

We hold a variable interest in a number of VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. Our investments in these VIEs are reported in fixed
maturities, available-for-sale; fixed maturities, trading; equity securities, trading and other investments in the consolidated statements of financial position and are described below.

Unconsolidated
VIEs include certain CMBS, residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities ("RMBS") and other ABS. All of these entities were deemed VIEs because the equity within
these entities is insufficient to sustain them. We determined we are not the primary beneficiary in the entities within these categories of investments. This determination was based primarily on the
fact we do not own the class of security that controls the unilateral right to replace the special servicer or equivalent function.

3. Variable Interest Entities — (continued)

As
previously discussed, we invest in several types of collateralized private investment vehicles, which are VIEs. These include cash and synthetic structures that we do not manage. We
have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of these collateralized private investment vehicles primarily because we do not control the economic performance of the entities and were not
involved with the design of the entities.

We
have invested in various VIE trusts as a debt holder. All of these entities are classified as VIEs due to insufficient equity to sustain them. We have determined we are not the
primary beneficiary primarily because we do not control the economic performance of the entities and were not involved with the design of the entities.

We
have invested in partnerships and other funds, which are classified as VIEs. The entities are VIEs as equity holders lack the power to control the most significant activities of the
entities because the equity holders do not have either the ability by a simple majority to exercise substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. We have determined we are not the
primary beneficiary because we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the entities.

We
hold an equity interest in Mexican mandatory privatized social security funds in which we provide asset management services. Our equity interest in the funds is considered a variable
interest. We concluded the funds are VIEs because the equity holders as a group lack decision-making ability through their voting rights. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because
although we, as the asset manager, have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs, we do not have a potentially significant variable interest in the funds.

The
carrying value and maximum loss exposure for our unconsolidated VIEs were as follows:

Our
risk of loss is limited to our initial investment measured at amortized cost for fixed maturities, available-for-sale. Our risk of loss is limited to our
investment measured at fair value for our fixed maturities, trading and equity securities, trading. Our risk of loss is limited to our carrying value plus any unfunded commitments and/or guarantees
for our other investments. Unfunded commitments are not liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position because we are only required to fund additional equity when called upon to do
so by the general partner or investment manager.

Money Market Funds

We are the investment manager for certain money market mutual funds. Prior to new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, these
funds were deemed to be VIEs. Under the prior guidance we were not considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since our involvement is limited primarily to being a service provider, and our
variable interest does not absorb the majority of the variability of the entities' net assets.



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

3. Variable Interest Entities — (continued)

Effective January 1, 2016, new accounting guidance provides a scope exception for money market funds registered under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or
similar funds. The scope exception eliminates the requirement to assess money market mutual funds under any consolidation model.

As
of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, these funds held $0.8 billion and $1.3 billion in total assets, respectively. We have no contractual obligation
to contribute to the funds; however, we provided support to these money market mutual funds through the waiver of fees and expense reimbursements. The amount of fees waived and expenses reimbursed was
insignificant.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

We have a process in place to identify fixed maturity and equity securities that could potentially have an impairment that is other than
temporary. This process involves monitoring market events that could impact
issuers' credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions and other similar factors. This process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels,
downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.

Each
reporting period, all securities are reviewed to determine whether an other-than-temporary decline in value exists and whether losses should be recognized. We consider relevant
facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate-related impairment of a security is other than temporary. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the
extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the
current and future impact of any specific events; (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows; (5) for fixed maturities, our intent to sell a security or
whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity and (6) for equity securities,
our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time that allows for the recovery in value. To the extent we determine a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, an
impairment loss is recognized.

Impairment
losses on equity securities are recognized in net income and are measured as the difference between amortized cost and fair value. The way in which impairment losses on fixed
maturities are recognized in the financial statements is dependent on the facts and circumstances related to the specific security. If we intend to sell a security or it is more likely than not that
we would be required to sell a security before the recovery of its amortized cost, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in net income for the difference between amortized cost and fair
value. If we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis, we do not plan to sell the security and if it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell a security before the
recovery of its amortized cost, the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated. We recognize the credit loss portion in net income and the noncredit loss portion in OCI
("bifurcated OTTI").

Represents
the net impact of (a) gains resulting from reclassification of noncredit impairment losses for fixed maturities with bifurcated OTTI from net
realized capital gains (losses) to OCI and (b) losses resulting from reclassification of previously recognized noncredit impairment losses from OCI to net realized capital gains (losses) for
fixed maturities with bifurcated OTTI that had additional credit losses or fixed maturities that previously had bifurcated OTTI that have now been sold or are intended to be sold.

We
estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a fixed maturity security impairment as the difference between amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of
the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to
accrete an asset-backed or floating rate security. The methodology and assumptions for establishing the best estimate cash flows vary depending on the type of security. The ABS cash flow estimates are
based on security specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds and structural
support, including subordination and guarantees. The corporate security cash flow estimates are derived from scenario-based outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or liquidations using bond
specific facts and circumstances including timing, security interests and loss severity.

The
following table provides a rollforward of accumulated credit losses for fixed maturities with bifurcated credit losses. The purpose of the table is to provide detail of
(1) additions to the bifurcated credit loss amounts recognized in net realized capital gains (losses) during the period and (2) decrements for previously recognized bifurcated credit
losses where the loss is no longer bifurcated and/or there has been a positive change in expected cash flows or accretion of the bifurcated credit loss amount.

Of
the total amounts, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio represented $16,918.9 million in available-for-sale fixed maturities with gross unrealized losses of
$615.1 million. Of those fixed maturity securities in Principal Life's consolidated portfolio with a gross unrealized loss position, 94% were investment grade (rated AAA through BBB-) with an
average price of 96 (carrying value/amortized cost) as of December 31, 2016. Gross unrealized losses in our fixed maturities portfolio decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016,
primarily due to tightening of credit spreads, partially offset by an increase in interest rates.

For
those securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio held 1,911 securities with a carrying
value of $14,549.4 million and unrealized losses of $384.6 million reflecting an average price of 97 as of December 31, 2016. Of this portfolio, 98% was investment grade (rated
AAA through BBB–) as of December 31, 2016, with associated unrealized losses of $374.1 million. The unrealized losses on these securities can primarily be attributed to
changes in market interest rates and changes in credit spreads since the securities were acquired.

For
those securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position greater than or equal to twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio held 453 securities with a
carrying value of $2,369.5 million and unrealized
losses of $230.5 million. The average credit rating of this portfolio was A– with an average price of 91 as of December 31, 2016. Of the $230.5 million in
unrealized losses, the corporate sector accounts for $141.9 million in unrealized losses with an average price of 89 and an average credit rating of BBB–. The remaining
unrealized losses consist primarily of $46.9 million within the commercial mortgage-backed securities sector with an average price of 93 and an average credit rating of AA–. The
unrealized losses on these securities can primarily be attributed to changes in market interest rates and changes in credit spreads since the securities were acquired.

Of
the total amounts, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio represented $15,980.0 million in available-for-sale fixed maturities with gross unrealized losses of
$777.0 million. Of those fixed maturity securities in Principal Life's
consolidated portfolio with a gross unrealized loss position, 87% were investment grade (rated AAA through BBB–) with an average price of 95 (carrying value/amortized cost) as of
December 31, 2015. Gross unrealized losses in our fixed maturities portfolio increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in interest rates and
widening of credit spreads.

For
those securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio held 1,725 securities with a carrying
value of $13,673.9 million and unrealized losses of $376.3 million reflecting an average price of 97 as of December 31, 2015. Of this portfolio, 90% was investment grade (rated
AAA through BBB–) as of December 31, 2015, with associated unrealized losses of $298.1 million. The unrealized losses on these securities can primarily be attributed to
changes in market interest rates and changes in credit spreads since the securities were acquired.

For
those securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position greater than or equal to twelve months, Principal Life's consolidated portfolio held 404 securities with a
carrying value of $2,306.1 million and unrealized losses of $400.7 million. The average credit rating of this portfolio was BBB+ with an average price of 85 as of December 31,
2015. Of the $400.7 million in unrealized losses, the corporate sector accounts for $304.2 million in unrealized losses with an average price of 80 and an average credit rating of
BBB–. The remaining unrealized losses consist primarily of $50.7 million within the commercial mortgage-backed securities sector with an average price of 86 and an average

Mortgage Loans

Mortgage loans consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans. We evaluate risks inherent in our commercial mortgage loans in two classes:
(1) brick and mortar property loans, including mezzanine loans, where we analyze the property's rent payments as support for the loan, and (2) credit tenant loans ("CTL"),
where we rely on the credit analysis of the tenant for the repayment of the loan. We evaluate risks inherent in our residential mortgage loan portfolio in two classes: (1) home equity mortgages
and (2) first lien mortgages. The carrying amount of our mortgage loan portfolio was as follows:

Our
residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of home equity mortgages with an amortized cost of $165.6 million and $218.8 million and first lien mortgages with an
amortized cost of $1,054.3 million and $906.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our residential home equity mortgages are concentrated in
the United States and are generally second lien mortgages comprised of closed-end loans and lines of credit. Our first lien loans are concentrated in Chile and the United States.

Mortgage Loan Credit Monitoring

Commercial Credit Risk Profile Based on Internal Rating

We actively monitor and manage our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. All commercial mortgage loans are analyzed regularly and substantially
all are internally rated, based on a proprietary risk rating cash flow model, in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets. The model stresses expected cash flows at various levels and at
different points in time depending on the durability of the income stream, which includes our assessment of factors such as location (macro and micro markets), tenant quality and lease expirations.
Our internal rating analysis presents expected losses in terms of an S&P Global ("S&P") bond equivalent rating. As the credit risk for commercial mortgage loans increases, we adjust our internal
ratings downward with loans in the category "B+ and below" having the highest risk for credit loss. Internal ratings on commercial mortgage loans are updated at least annually and potentially more
often for certain loans with material changes in collateral value or occupancy and for loans on an internal "watch list".

Commercial
mortgage loans that require more frequent and detailed attention than other loans in our portfolio are identified and placed on an internal "watch list". Among the criteria
that would indicate a potential problem are significant negative changes in ratios of loan to value or contract rents to debt service, major tenant vacancies or bankruptcies, borrower sponsorship
problems, late payments, delinquent taxes and loan relief/restructuring requests.

Residential Credit Risk Profile Based on Performance Status

Our residential mortgage loan portfolio is monitored based on performance of the loans. Monitoring on a residential mortgage loan increases when
the loan is delinquent or earlier if there is an indication of potential impairment. We define non-performing residential mortgage loans as loans 90 days or greater delinquent or on non-accrual
status.

Non-Accrual Mortgage Loans

Commercial and residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status if we have concern regarding the collectability of future payments or
if a loan has matured without being paid off or extended. Factors considered may include conversations with the borrower, loss of major tenant, bankruptcy of borrower or major tenant, decreased
property cash flow for commercial mortgage loans or number of days past due and other circumstances for residential mortgage loans. Based on an assessment as to the collectability of the principal, a
determination is made to apply any payments received either against the principal or according to the contractual terms of the loan. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued unpaid
interest receivable is reversed against interest income. Accrual of interest resumes after factors resulting in doubts about collectability have improved. Residential first lien mortgages in the
Chilean market are carried on accrual for a longer period of delinquency than domestic loans, as assessment of collectability is based on the nature of the loans and collection practices in that
market.

Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowance

We establish a valuation allowance to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in our portfolio. The valuation allowance includes loan
specific reserves for loans that are deemed to be impaired as well as reserves for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property risk or market specific risk has not been
identified but for which we anticipate a loss may occur. Mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we determine a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established equal to the difference between the carrying
amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value reduced by the cost to sell. Estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or fair value of the collateral. Subsequent changes in the estimated value are reflected in the valuation allowance. Amounts on loans deemed
to be uncollectible are charged off and removed from the valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance provision is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated
statements of operations.

The
valuation allowance is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Management's periodic evaluation and assessment of the
valuation allowance adequacy is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of the underlying collateral,
composition of the loan portfolio, portfolio delinquency information, underwriting standards, peer group information, current economic conditions, loss experience and other relevant factors. The
evaluation of our

impaired
loan component is subjective, as it requires the estimation of timing and amount of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans.

We
review our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and analyze the need for a valuation allowance for any loan that is delinquent for 60 days or more, in process of foreclosure,
restructured, on the internal "watch list" or that currently has a valuation allowance. In addition to establishing allowance levels for specifically identified impaired commercial mortgage loans,
management determines an allowance for all other loans in the portfolio for which historical experience and current economic conditions indicate certain losses exist. These loans are segregated by
risk rating level with an estimated loss ratio applied against each risk rating level. The loss ratio is generally based upon historical loss experience for each risk rating level as adjusted for
certain current environmental factors management believes to be relevant.

For
our residential mortgage loan portfolio, we separate the loans into several homogeneous pools, each of which consist of loans of a similar nature including but not limited to loans
similar in collateral, term and structure and loan purpose or type. We evaluate loan pools based on aggregated risk ratings, estimated specific loss potential in the different classes of credits, and
historical loss experience by pool type. We adjust these quantitative factors for qualitative factors of present conditions. Qualitative factors include items such as economic and business conditions,
changes in the portfolio, value of underlying collateral and concentrations. Residential mortgage loan pools exclude loans that have been restructured or impaired, as those loans are evaluated
individually.

Impaired Mortgage Loans

Impaired mortgage loans are loans with a related specific valuation allowance, loans whose carrying amount has been reduced to the expected
collectible amount because the impairment has been considered other than temporary or a loan modification has been classified as a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"). Based on an assessment as to the
collectability of the principal, a determination is made to apply any payments received either against the principal or according to the contractual terms of the loan. Our recorded investment in and
unpaid principal balance of impaired loans along with the related loan specific allowance for losses, if any, and the average recorded investment and interest income recognized during the time the
loans were impaired were as follows:

Mortgage Loan Modifications

Our commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios include loans that have been modified. We assess loan modifications on a case-by-case
basis to evaluate whether a TDR has occurred. The commercial mortgage loan TDRs were modified to delay or reduce principal payments and to reduce or delay interest payments. For these TDR assessments,
we have determined the loan rates are now considered below market based on current circumstances. The commercial mortgage loan modifications resulted in delayed cash receipts and a decrease in
interest income. The residential mortgage loan TDRs include modifications of interest-only payment periods, delays in principal balloon payments, and interest rate reductions. Residential mortgage
loan modifications resulted in delayed or decreased cash receipts and a decrease in interest income.

The
following table includes information about outstanding loans that were modified and met the criteria of a TDR during the periods indicated. In addition, the table includes
information for loans that were modified and met the criteria of a TDR within the past twelve months that were in payment default during the periods indicated:

Commercial
mortgage loans that have been designated as a TDR have been previously reserved for in the mortgage loan valuation allowance at the estimated fair value of the underlying
collateral reduced by the cost to sell.

Residential
mortgage loans that have been designated as a TDR are specifically reserved for in the mortgage loan valuation allowance if losses result from the modification. Residential
mortgage loans that have defaulted or have been discharged through bankruptcy are reduced to the expected collectible amount.

Real Estate

Depreciation expense on invested real estate was $52.0 million, $49.3 million and $46.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Accumulated depreciation was $450.4 million and $405.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Other Investments

Other investments include interests in unconsolidated entities, domestic and international joint ventures and partnerships and properties owned
jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners. Such investments are generally accounted for using the equity method. In applying the equity method, we record our share of income or loss
reported by the equity investees in net investment income. Summarized financial information for these unconsolidated entities was as follows:

In
addition, other investments include $875.2 million and $819.3 million of direct financing leases as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Chilean
operations enter into private placement contracts for commercial, industrial and office space properties whereby our Chilean operations purchase the real estate and/or building from the seller-lessee
but then lease the property back to the seller-lessee. Ownership of the property is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term. The direct financing lease receivables are carried at
amortized cost. We actively monitor and manage our direct financing leases. All leases within the portfolio are analyzed regularly and internally rated, based on financial condition, payment history
and loan-to-value.

Derivative
assets are carried at fair value and reported as a component of other investments. Certain sponsored investment funds are also carried at fair value and reported as a
component of other investments, with changes in fair value included in net realized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated statements of operations.

Securities Posted as Collateral

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we posted $2,562.8 million and $2,705.5 million, respectively, in commercial mortgage
loans and home equity mortgages to satisfy collateral requirements associated with our obligation under funding agreements with Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB Des Moines"). In addition,
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we posted $2,233.2 million and $935.7 million, respectively, in fixed maturities, available-for-sale securities to satisfy collateral
requirements primarily associated with a reinsurance arrangement, our derivative credit support annex (collateral) agreements, Futures Commission Merchant ("FCM") agreements, a lending arrangement and
our obligation under funding agreements with FHLB Des Moines. Since we did not relinquish ownership rights on these instruments, they are reported as fixed maturities, available-for-sale and mortgage
loans, respectively, on our consolidated statements of financial position. Of the securities posted as collateral, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $272.8 million and
$295.2 million, respectively, could be sold or repledged by the secured party.

The
gross amount of recognized derivative liabilities are reported with other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position. The above excludes
$394.3 million and $421.5 million of derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which are primarily embedded derivatives that are
not subject to master netting agreements or similar agreements. The gross amount of recognized repurchase agreement liabilities are reported with short-term debt on the consolidated statements of
financial position. The gross amounts of derivative and repurchase agreement liabilities are not netted against offsetting assets for presentation on the consolidated statements of financial position.

(2)

Represents
amount of offsetting derivative assets that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement or similar agreement that are not netted against the
gross derivative liabilities for presentation on the consolidated statements of financial position.

The
financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements or similar agreements include right of setoff provisions. Derivative instruments include provisions to setoff
positions covered under the agreements with the same counterparties and provisions to setoff positions outside of the agreements with the same counterparties in the event of default by one of the
parties. Derivative instruments also include collateral provisions. Collateral received and pledged is generally settled daily with each counterparty. See Note 5, Derivative Financial
Instruments, for further details.

Repurchase
and reverse repurchase agreements include provisions to setoff other repurchase and reverse repurchase balances with the same counterparty. Repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements also include collateral provisions with the counterparties. For reverse repurchase agreements we require the counterparties to pledge collateral with a value greater than the amount of cash
transferred. We have the right but do not sell or repledge collateral received in reverse repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are structured as secured borrowings for all counterparties. We
pledge fixed maturities available-for-sale, which the counterparties have the right to sell or repledge. Interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as part of operating expenses on the
consolidated statements of operations. Net proceeds related to repurchase agreements are reported as a component of financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We did not have
any outstanding repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2015.

5. Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are generally used to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks associated with assets held or expected to be purchased or sold and liabilities incurred or expected to be
incurred. Derivatives are used to change the characteristics of our asset/liability mix consistent with our risk management activities. Derivatives are also used in asset replication strategies.

Types of Derivative Instruments

Interest Rate Contracts

Interest rate risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Sources of interest rate risk include the
difference between the maturity and interest rate changes of assets with the liabilities they support, timing differences between the pricing of liabilities and the purchase or procurement of assets
and changing cash flow profiles from original projections due to prepayment options embedded within asset and liability contracts. We use various derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.

Interest
rate swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based
upon designated market rates or rate indices and an agreed upon notional principal amount. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by any
party. Cash is paid or received based on the terms of the swap. We use interest rate swaps



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

December 31, 2016

5. Derivative Financial Instruments — (continued)

primarily
to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities and to mitigate the risks arising from timing mismatches between assets and liabilities (including duration
mismatches). We also use interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the value of assets we anticipate acquiring and other anticipated transactions and commitments. Interest rate swaps are used to
hedge against changes in the value of the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB") liability. The GMWB rider on our variable annuity products provides for guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits
regardless of the actual performance of various equity and/or fixed income funds available with the product.

Interest
rate options, including interest rate caps and interest rate floors, which can be combined to form interest rate collars, are contracts that entitle the purchaser to pay or
receive the amounts, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds a cap strike interest rate, or falls below a floor strike interest rate, respectively, at specified dates. We use interest rate
collars to manage interest rate risk related to guaranteed minimum interest rate liabilities in our individual annuities contracts and lapse risk associated with higher interest rates.

A
swaption is an option to enter into an interest rate swap at a future date. We purchase swaptions to offset or modify existing exposures. Swaptions provide us the benefit of the
agreed-upon strike rate if the market rates for liabilities are higher, with the flexibility to enter into the current market rate swap if the market rates for liabilities are lower. Swaptions not
only hedge against the downside risk, but also allow us to take advantage of any upside benefits.

In
exchange-traded futures transactions, we agree to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values of which are determined by the values of designated classes of
securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. We enter into exchange-traded futures with regulated
futures commissions merchants who are members of a trading exchange. We have used exchange-traded futures to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter mismatches between the
assets in a portfolio and the liabilities supported by those assets.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Foreign currency risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk arises
from foreign currency-denominated funding agreements we issue, foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity and equity securities we invest in, capital transactions with our international operations
and the financial results of our international operations. We use various derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Currency
swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, a series of principal and interest payments in one currency for that of another
currency. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the beginning and termination of the currency swap by each party. The interest payments are primarily fixed-to-fixed rate;
however, they may also be fixed-to-floating rate or floating-to-fixed rate. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one
counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date. We use currency swaps to reduce market risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect to investments or liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies that we either hold or intend to acquire or sell.

Currency
forwards are contracts in which we agree with other parties to deliver or receive a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. Typically, the price
is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. We use currency forwards to reduce market risks from changes in currency exchange rates
with respect to investments or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that we either hold or intend to acquire or sell. We sometimes use currency forwards to hedge the currency risk associated
with a business combination or to hedge certain net equity investments in or expected cash flows from our foreign operations.

Equity Contracts

Equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in common stock prices. We use various derivatives to
manage our exposure to equity risk, which arises from products in which the interest we credit is tied to an external equity index as well as products subject to minimum contractual guarantees.

We
purchase equity call spreads to hedge the equity participation rates promised to contractholders in conjunction with our fixed deferred annuity and universal life products that credit
interest based on changes in an external equity index. We use exchange-traded futures and equity put options to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB liability related to the GMWB rider on
our variable annuity product, as previously explained. The premium associated with certain options is paid quarterly over the life of the option contract.

5. Derivative Financial Instruments — (continued)

Credit Contracts

Credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and
interest. We use credit default swaps to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by providing comparable exposure to fixed income securities that might not be available in the primary market.
They are also used to hedge credit exposures in our investment portfolio. Credit derivatives are used to sell or buy credit protection on an identified name or names on an unfunded or synthetic basis
in return for receiving or paying a quarterly premium. The premium generally corresponds to a referenced name's credit spread at the time the agreement is executed. In cases where we sell protection,
we also buy a quality cash bond to match against the credit default swap, thereby entering into a synthetic transaction replicating a cash security. When selling protection, if there is an event of
default by the referenced name, as defined by the agreement, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security in a principal
amount equal to the notional value of the credit default swap.

Total
return swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, an amount determined by the difference between the previous price and the
current price of a reference asset based upon an agreed upon notional principal amount plus an additional amount determined by the financing spread. We currently use futures traded on an exchange
("exchange-traded") and total return swaps referencing equity indices to hedge our portfolio from potential credit losses related to systemic events.

Other Contracts

Embedded Derivatives.

We purchase or issue certain financial instruments or products that contain a derivative instrument that
is embedded in the
financial instrument or product. When it is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly or closely related to the economic characteristics of the
host contract and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host instrument for measurement purposes. The
embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the consolidated statements of financial position, is carried at fair value.

We
have investment contracts in which the return is tied to a leveraged inflation index. We economically hedge the risk associated with these investment contracts.

We
offer group annuity contracts that have guaranteed separate accounts as an investment option. We also offer funds with embedded fixed-rate guarantees as investment options in our
defined contribution plans in Hong Kong.

We
have structured investment relationships with trusts we have determined to be VIEs, which are consolidated in our financial statements. The notes issued by these trusts include
obligations to deliver an underlying security to residual interest holders and the obligations contain an embedded derivative of the forecasted transaction to deliver the underlying security.

We
have fixed deferred annuities and universal life contracts that credit interest based on changes in an external equity index. We also have certain variable annuity products with a
GMWB rider, which allows the customer to make withdrawals of a specified annual amount, either for a fixed number of years or for the lifetime of the customer, even if the account value is fully
exhausted. Declines in the equity markets may increase our exposure to benefits under contracts with the GMWB. We economically hedge the exposure in these contracts, as previously explained.

Exposure

Our risk of loss is typically limited to the fair value of our derivative instruments and not to the notional or contractual amounts of these
derivatives. We are also exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance of the counterparties. Our current credit exposure is limited to the value of derivatives that have become favorable to
us. This credit risk is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with high credit ratings and by establishing and monitoring exposure limits. We also utilize various credit
enhancements, including collateral and credit triggers to reduce the credit exposure to our derivative instruments.

Derivatives
may be exchange-traded or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives. Certain of our OTC derivatives
are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties ("OTC cleared"), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties ("bilateral OTC"). Our derivative transactions are
generally documented under International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. ("ISDA") Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties.
Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a transaction, we are permitted to set off our receivable from a counterparty against our payables to the same counterparty

arising
out of all included transactions. For reporting purposes, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral
against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparties under master netting agreements.

We
posted $322.4 million and $342.7 million in cash and securities under collateral arrangements as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
to satisfy collateral requirements associated with our derivative credit support agreements and FCM agreements. These amounts include initial margin requirements.

Certain
of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade rating from each of the major credit rating agencies on our debt. If the ratings
on our debt were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of these provisions and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate
and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value, inclusive of accrued interest, of all derivative instruments with
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position without regard to netting under derivative credit support annex agreements as of December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, was $454.7 million and $606.5 million, respectively. Cleared derivatives have contingent features that require us to post excess margin as required by the FCM.
The terms surrounding excess margin vary by FCM agreement. With respect to derivatives containing collateral triggers, we posted collateral and initial margin of $322.4 million and
$342.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, in the normal course of business, which reflects netting under derivative agreements. If the
credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered on December 31, 2016, we would be required to post an additional $42.0 million of collateral to our
counterparties.

As
of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had received $576.3 million and $217.5 million, respectively, of cash collateral associated with our
derivative credit support annex agreements and FCM agreements, for which we recorded a corresponding liability reflecting our obligation to return the collateral.

Notional
amounts are used to express the extent of our involvement in derivative transactions and represent a standard measurement of the volume of our derivative activity. Notional
amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for contracts such as currency swaps.

The

respectively, are reported with contractholder funds on the consolidated statements of financial position.

Credit Derivatives Sold

When we sell credit protection, we are exposed to the underlying credit risk similar to purchasing a fixed maturity security instrument. The
majority of our credit derivative contracts sold reference a single name or reference security (referred to as "single name credit default swaps"). The remainder of our credit derivatives reference
either a basket or index of securities. These instruments are either referenced in an OTC credit derivative transaction or embedded within an investment structure that has been fully consolidated into
our financial statements.

These
credit derivative transactions are subject to events of default defined within the terms of the contract, which normally consist of bankruptcy, failure to pay, or modified
restructuring of the reference entity and/or issue. If a default event occurs for a reference name or security, we are obligated to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the notional amount of the
credit derivative transaction. As a result, our maximum future payment is equal to the notional amount of the credit derivative. In certain cases, we also have purchased credit protection with
identical underlyings to certain of our sold protection transactions. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not purchase credit protection relating to our sold protection
transactions. In certain circumstances, our potential loss could also be reduced by any amount recovered in the default proceedings of the underlying credit name.

We
purchased an investment structure with embedded credit features that is fully consolidated into our financial statements. This consolidation results in recognition of the underlying
credit derivatives and collateral within the structure, typically high quality fixed maturities that are owned by a special purpose vehicle. These credit derivatives reference several names in a
basket structure. In the event of default, the collateral within the structure would typically be liquidated to pay the claims of the credit derivative counterparty.

Includes
$60.0 million and $78.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, notional of derivatives in
consolidated collateralized private investment vehicle VIEs where the credit risk is borne by third party investors.

We
also have invested in fixed maturities classified as trading that contain credit default swaps. These securities are subject to the credit risk of the issuer, normally a special
purpose vehicle, which consists of the underlying credit default swaps and high quality fixed maturities that serve as collateral. A default event occurs if the cumulative losses exceed a specified
attachment point, which is typically not the first loss of the portfolio. If a default event occurs that exceeds the specified attachment point, our investment may not be fully returned. We would have
no future potential payments under these investments. The following tables show, by the types of referenced/underlying asset class and external rating, our fixed maturities with embedded credit
derivatives.

Fair Value Hedges

We use fixed-to-floating rate interest rate swaps to more closely align the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities. In
general, these swaps are used in asset and liability management to modify duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes.

We
enter into currency exchange swap agreements to convert certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollar floating-rate denominated instruments to eliminate the
exposure to future currency volatility on those items.

The
net interest effect of interest rate swap and currency swap transactions for derivatives in fair value hedges is recorded as an adjustment to income or expense of the underlying
hedged item in our consolidated statements of operations.

Hedge
effectiveness testing for fair value relationships is performed utilizing a regression analysis approach for both prospective and retrospective evaluations. This regression
analysis will consider multiple data points for the assessment that the hedge continues to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. In certain periods, the comparison of the
change in value of the derivative and the change in the value of the hedged item may not be offsetting at a specific period in time due to small movements in value. However, any amounts recorded as
fair value hedges have shown to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value both for present and future periods.

The
following table shows the effect of derivatives in fair value hedging relationships and the related hedged items on the consolidated statements of operations. All gains or losses on
derivatives were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Cash Flow Hedges

We utilize floating-to-fixed rate interest rate swaps to eliminate the variability in cash flows of recognized financial assets and liabilities
and forecasted transactions.

We
enter into currency exchange swap agreements to convert both principal and interest payments of certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollar denominated
fixed-rate instruments to eliminate the exposure to future currency volatility on those items.

The
net interest effect of interest rate swap and currency swap transactions for derivatives in cash flow hedges is recorded as an adjustment to income or expense of the underlying
hedged item in our consolidated statements of operations.

The
maximum length of time we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions, excluding those related to the payments of variable interest
on existing financial assets and liabilities, is 3.5 years. As of December 31, 2016, we had $16.2 million of net gains reported in AOCI on the consolidated statements of financial
position related to active hedges of forecasted transactions. If a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued. If it is probable that
the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the deferred gain or loss is immediately reclassified from AOCI into net income. During 2016 and 2015, we did not have any reclassifications from AOCI
into net realized capital gains (losses) as a result of the determination that hedged cash flows were probable of not occurring.

The
ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges is reported in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. The net gain resulting from the
ineffective portion of foreign currency contracts in cash flow hedging relationships was $0.3 million, $0.0 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively.

We
expect to reclassify net gains of $3.7 million from AOCI into net income in the next 12 months, which includes both net deferred gains on discontinued hedges and net
losses on periodic settlements of active hedges. Actual amounts may vary from this amount as a result of market conditions.

Net Investment Hedges

We may take measures to hedge our net equity investments in our foreign operations from currency risk. This is accomplished with the use of
currency forwards.

Gains
and losses associated with net investment hedges are recorded in AOCI and will be released into earnings if our investment in the foreign operation is sold or substantially
liquidated.

The
amount of gain recognized in AOCI on derivatives was $0.0 million, $1.7 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

Our use of futures, certain swaptions and swaps, collars, options and forwards are effective from an economic standpoint, but they have not been
designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. As such, periodic changes in the market value of these instruments, which includes mark-to-market gains and losses as well as periodic and final
settlements, primarily flow directly into net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.

The
following table shows the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, including fair value changes of embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated from the host
contract, on the consolidated statements of operations.

6. Closed Block

In connection with the 1998 MIHC formation, Principal Life formed a Closed Block to provide reasonable assurance to policyholders included therein that, after the formation of the MIHC,
assets would be available to maintain dividends in aggregate in accordance with the 1997 policy dividend scales, if the experience underlying such scales continued. Assets of Principal Life were
allocated to the Closed Block in an amount that produces cash flows which, together with anticipated revenue from policies and contracts included in the Closed Block, were expected to be sufficient to
support the Closed Block policies. This includes, but is not limited to, provisions for payment of claims, certain expenses, charges and taxes, and to provide for continuation of policy and contract
dividends in aggregate in accordance with the 1997 dividend scales, if the experience underlying such scales continues, and to allow for appropriate adjustments in such scales, if such experience
changes. Due to adjustable life policies being included in the Closed Block, the Closed Block is charged with amounts necessary to properly fund for certain adjustments, such as face amount and
premium increases, that are made to these policies after the Closed Block inception date. These amounts are referred to as Funding Adjustment Charges and are treated as capital transfers from the
Closed Block.

Assets
allocated to the Closed Block inure solely to the benefit of the holders of policies included in the Closed Block. Closed Block assets and liabilities are carried on the same
basis as other similar assets and liabilities. Principal Life will continue to pay guaranteed benefits under all policies, including the policies within the Closed Block, in accordance with their
terms. If the assets allocated to the Closed Block, the investment cash flows from those assets and the revenues from the policies included in the Closed Block, including investment income thereon,
prove to be insufficient to pay the benefits guaranteed under the policies included in the Closed Block, Principal Life will be required to make such payments from its general funds. No additional
policies were added to the Closed Block, nor was the Closed Block affected in any other way, as a result of the demutualization.

A
policyholder dividend obligation ("PDO") is required to be established for earnings in the Closed Block that are not available to stockholders. A model of the Closed Block was
established to produce the pattern of expected earnings in the Closed Block, adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI.

If
actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the Closed Block, only the expected cumulative earnings will be recognized in
income with the excess recorded as a PDO. This PDO represents undistributed accumulated earnings that will be paid to Closed Block policyholders as dividends unless offset by future performance of the
Closed Block that is less favorable than originally expected. If actual cumulative performance is less favorable than expected, only actual earnings will be recognized in income. As of
December 31, 2016,

6. Closed Block — (continued)

cumulative
actual earnings were greater than cumulative expected earnings. Therefore, we established an additional $8.2 million liability, which was recorded within policyholder dividends
obligation. As of December 31, 2015, cumulative actual earnings were less than cumulative expected earnings. However, cumulative net unrealized gains were greater than expected, resulting in
the recognition of a PDO of $117.9 million and $88.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our
GICs and funding agreements contain provisions limiting or prohibiting early surrenders, which typically include penalties for early surrenders, minimum notice requirements or, in
the case of funding agreements with survivor options, minimum pre-death holding periods and specific maximum amounts.

Funding
agreements include those issued directly to nonqualified institutional investors, as well as under five separate programs where the funding agreements have been issued directly
or indirectly to unconsolidated special purpose entities. Claims for principal and interest under funding agreements are afforded equal priority to claims of life insurance and annuity policyholders
under insolvency provisions of Iowa Insurance Laws.

8. Insurance Liabilities — (continued)

Principal
Life was authorized to issue up to $4.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in 1998 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an
unaffiliated entity in non-U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $106.7 million and $107.5 million, respectively, of liabilities were outstanding with respect to the
issuance outstanding under this program. Principal Life was also authorized to issue up to Euro 4.0 billion (approximately USD$5.3 billion) of funding agreements under a program
established in 2006 to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an unaffiliated entity in non-U.S. markets. The unaffiliated entity is an unconsolidated special purpose vehicle. As of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, $702.0 million and $1,021.0 million, respectively, of liabilities were outstanding with respect to issuances outstanding under this program. Principal
Life does not anticipate any new issuance activity under either of these programs due to the existence of the program established in 2011 described below.

In
addition, Principal Life was authorized to issue up to $7.0 billion of funding agreements under a program established in 2001 to support the prospective issuance of medium term
notes by an unaffiliated entity in both domestic and international markets. The unaffiliated entity is an unconsolidated special purpose entity. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
$201.5 million and $201.4 million, respectively, of liabilities were being held with respect to issuances outstanding under this program. Principal Life does not anticipate any new
issuance activity under this program, given our December 2005 termination of the dealership agreement for this program and the availability of the program established in 2011 described below.

Additionally,
Principal Life was authorized to issue up to $9.0 billion of funding agreements under a program that was originally established in March 2004 to support the
prospective issuance of medium term notes by unaffiliated entities in both domestic and international markets. Under this program, both the notes and the supporting funding agreements were registered
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $119.8 million and $246.0 million, respectively, of liabilities were being
held with respect to issuances outstanding under this program. In contrast with direct funding agreements, GIC issuances and the other three funding agreement-backed medium term note programs
described above, Principal Life's payment obligations on each funding agreement issued under this SEC-registered program are guaranteed by PFG. Principal Life does not anticipate any new issuance
activity under this program due to the existence of the program established in 2011 described below.

Principal
Life was authorized to issue up to $5.0 billion of funding agreements under a program that was originally established in 2011 to support the prospective issuance of
medium term notes by an unaffiliated entity in both domestic and international markets. The unaffiliated entity is an unconsolidated special purpose entity. In June 2015, this program was amended to
authorize issuance of up to an additional $4.0 billion in recognition of the use of nearly all $5.0 billion of existing issuance authorization. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
$4,389.4 million and
$3,537.0 million, respectively, of liabilities were being held with respect to issuances outstanding under this program. Similar to the SEC-registered program, Principal Life's payment
obligations on each funding agreement issued under this program are guaranteed by PFG. The program established in 2011 is not registered with the SEC.

liability adjustments relating to prior years, which affected current operations during 2016, 2015 and 2014, resulted in part from developed claims for prior years being
different than were anticipated when the liabilities for unpaid claims were originally estimated. These trends have been considered in establishing the current year liability for unpaid claims.

Claims Development

The following tables present undiscounted information about claims development by incurral year, including separate information about incurred
claims and paid claims net of reinsurance for the periods indicated. The tables also include information on incurred but not reported claims and the cumulative number of reported claims.

The
tables present information for the number of years for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding, but do not exceed ten years. The data is disaggregated into groupings of
claims with similar characteristics, such as duration of the claim payment period and average claim amount, and with consideration to the overall size of the groupings. Outstanding liabilities equal
total net incurred claims less total net paid claims plus outstanding liabilities for net unpaid claims of prior years.

As
of both December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had short-term credit facilities with various financial institutions in an aggregate amount of $1,005.0 million. As of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $51.4 million and $181.1 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings, with no assets pledged as support. Our credit facilities include a
$400.0 million 5-year facility that matures in March 2021, with Principal Financial Services, Inc., Principal Life and us as co-borrowers, a $300.0 million 364-day facility with
Principal Life as borrower that matures in March 2017, and a $200.0 million 5-year facility with Principal Financial Services, Inc., Principal Life, Principal Financial Services V
(UK) LTD and us as the co-borrowers that matures in March 2021. These facilities may be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper back-stop. In addition to the revolving
credit facilities, Principal International Chile has the capacity to access up to $60.0 million in unsecured lines of credit offered by Chilean financial institutions and Principal Life has a
$45.0 million unsecured line of credit. Our commercial paper programs require 100% back-stop support, of which we had no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

The
weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, was 4.4% and 4.2%, respectively.

Includes
external debt issuance costs incurred for long-term affiliated debt issued in a foreign jurisdiction.

Net
discount, premium and issuance costs associated with issuing these notes are amortized to expense over the respective terms using the interest method.

On
November 10, 2016, we issued $650.0 million of senior notes. We issued a $350.0 million series of notes that bear interest at 3.1% and will mature in 2026 and a
$300.0 million series of notes that bear interest at 4.3% and will mature in 2046. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 each year, beginning on
May 15, 2017. The proceeds from these notes were used to redeem our notes payable due in 2017 and 2019. We incurred a one-time cost to extinguish this debt before the scheduled maturity date.

On
May 7, 2015, we issued $400.0 million of senior notes. The notes bear interest at 3.4% and will mature in 2025. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on
May 15 and November 15 each year, beginning on November 15, 2015. In addition, on May 7, 2015, we issued $400.0 million of junior subordinated notes, which are
subordinated to all our senior debt. The notes are callable in 2020 and have a maturity date in 2055. The notes initially bear a fixed rate of interest at 4.7% and convert to a floating rate at the
date the notes become callable. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 each year. After the call date the notes will bear interest at 3-month LIBOR plus
3.044%, reset quarterly and payable in arrears in February, May, August and November each year. We have the right

to
defer interest payments on the junior subordinated notes for up to 5 years without resulting in a default, during which time interest will be compounded. The proceeds from these notes were
used to redeem our series A and series B preferred stock with the remainder available for general corporate purposes.

On
November 16, 2012, we issued $900.0 million of senior notes. We issued a $300.0 million series of notes that bore interest at 1.85% and were to mature in 2017.
These notes were repaid following our November 2016 debt issuance. We issued a $300.0 million series of notes that bear interest at 3.125% and will mature in 2023 and a $300.0 million
series of notes that bear interest at 4.35% and will mature in 2043. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 each year, beginning on May 15, 2013.
The proceeds were used to fund our acquisition of Cuprum.

On
September 5, 2012, we issued $600.0 million of senior notes. We issued a $300.0 million series of notes that bear interest at 3.3% and will mature in 2022 and a
$300.0 million series of notes that bear interest at 4.625% and will mature in 2042. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 each year,
beginning on March 15, 2013. The proceeds were used for the repayment of the $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2014 and to partially fund our acquisition of
Cuprum.

On
May 18, 2009, we issued $750.0 million of senior notes. We issued a $400.0 million series of notes that bore interest at 7.875% and were to mature on
May 15, 2014. These notes were repaid following our November 2012 debt issuance. We issued a $350.0 million series of notes that bore interest at 8.875% and were to mature on
May 15, 2019. These notes were repaid following our November 2016 debt issuance. Interest on the notes was payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 each year, beginning on
November 15, 2009. The proceeds were primarily used to refinance $440.9 million of notes that matured on August 15, 2009, with the remaining proceeds being used for general
corporate purposes.

On
October 16 and December 5, 2006, we issued $500.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of senior notes. The notes bear interest at a rate of 6.05% per
year. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 each year and began on April 15, 2007. The notes will mature on October 15, 2036. A portion
of the
proceeds were used to fund the 2006 acquisition of WM Advisors, Inc., with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. A tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2016
resulted in redemption of $94.4 million of the senior notes. We incurred a one-time cost to extinguish this debt before the scheduled maturity date.

The
non-recourse mortgages and notes payable are primarily financings for real estate developments. Outstanding principal balances as of December 31, 2016, were
$0.0 million due to outstanding debt maturing in 2016. Outstanding principal balances as of December 31, 2015, ranged from $1.8 million to $41.1 million per development
with interest rates being variable. Outstanding debt is secured by the underlying real estate properties, which were reported as real estate on our consolidated statements of financial position with a
carrying value of $79.5 million as of December 31, 2015.

In
management's judgment, total deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Included in the deferred income tax asset are tax carryforwards available to offset
future taxable income or income taxes. As of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had tax credit carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $275.7 million and $227.4 million, respectively. Alternative minimum, foreign
and general business tax credit carryovers were generated during the period we utilized net operating losses, primarily attributable to our captive reinsurance companies that joined our consolidated
U.S. federal income tax return beginning in 2012 and 2013. Some of these tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2023 while others never expire. As of December 31, 2016, all accumulated U.S.
federal tax credit carryforwards are anticipated to be utilized before expiration; therefore, no valuation allowance has been provided for the related deferred income tax assets.

As
of December 31, 2016 and 2015, domestic state net operating and capital loss carryforwards were $587.7 million and $387.7 million, respectively, and expired or
will expire between 2021 and 2035. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $151.6 million and $197.1 million, respectively, with some
expiring in 2017 while others never expire. We maintain valuation allowances by jurisdiction against the deferred income tax assets related to certain of these carryforwards and other items, as
utilization of these income tax benefits fail the more likely than not criteria in certain jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, valuation allowances of $7.3 million and
$11.9 million, respectively, had been recorded against the income tax benefits associated primarily with foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments to the valuation allowance will be
made if there is a change in management's assessment of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.

Tax
legislation increasing the Brazilian tax rate was enacted in September 2015. The three-year rate increase did not have a material impact on our consolidated results. Tax legislation
transitioning an increase in the Chilean tax rate over five years was enacted in September 2014. Our net deferred tax liabilities increased $58.1 million in the third quarter of 2014 as a
result of the legislation in Chile.

Deferred
tax liabilities are recognized for taxes payable on the unremitted earnings from foreign operations of our subsidiaries, except where it is our intention to indefinitely
reinvest a portion or all of these undistributed earnings. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, U.S. federal and state deferred income taxes were not provided on approximately
$1,088.4 million and $1,004.6 million, respectively, of such accumulated but undistributed earnings from operations of foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend to repatriate
these unremitted earnings because we have several liquidity options to fund our domestic operations and obligations. These options include investing and financing activities, such as issuing debt, as
well as cash-flow and dividends from domestic operations. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability that would arise if foreign earnings were remitted
due to the complexity of our international holding company structure, the availability of foreign tax credits, the rules governing the utilization of foreign tax credits, and the interplay between
utilization of such foreign tax credits and other significant tax attributes. As of December 31, 2016, deferred taxes were also not provided on the approximately $106.2 million of excess
book carrying value over tax basis with respect to the original investment in our foreign subsidiaries. A tax liability will be recognized when we no longer plan to indefinitely reinvest a portion or
all of these earnings or when we plan to sell a portion or all of our ownership interest.

Other Tax Information

Income tax returns are filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various states and foreign jurisdictions where we and one or more of
our subsidiaries conduct business. Although determined by jurisdiction, with few exceptions our



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

10. Income Taxes — (continued)

tax
uncertainties relate primarily to the U.S. federal jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed examination of our consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for years prior
to 2009. We are contesting certain issues and have filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, requesting refunds for the years 1995-2003. We believe there is a reasonable possibility this litigation
can be resolved within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $242.9 million and $229.9 million, respectively, of current income tax receivables
associated with outstanding audit issues reported as other assets in our consolidated statements of financial position.

We
filed claims for refund for tax years 2006 through 2008 in 2015 and tax year 2012 in 2016. The IRS commenced audit of our U.S. federal income tax return for 2009 in the fourth quarter
of 2011, 2010 in the first quarter of 2012, 2011 in the first quarter of 2013, and 2012 in the third quarter of 2015. We do not expect the results of these audits or developments in other tax areas
for all open tax years to significantly change the possible increase in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, but the outcome of tax reviews is uncertain and unforeseen results can occur.

The
U.S. Court of Federal Claims denied cross-motions for partial summary judgment on February 4, 2015, and ordered a trial on the previously taxed income issue in the case of
Principal Life Insurance Company and Subsidiaries v. the United States. Previously, in the same case, on May 9, 2014, the court ruled against Principal Life's tax treatment of transactions
involving the purchase and sale of principal-only certificates. These recent events caused the re-evaluation of all our pending uncertain tax positions, which resulted in a $30.3 million
reduction in net income in the first quarter of 2015 and a $47.5 million reduction in net income in the second quarter of 2014. We believe we have adequate defenses against, or sufficient
provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution could take several years while legal remedies are pursued. Consequently, we do not expect the ultimate resolution of issues from tax years
1995-2003 or those that might arise in tax years subsequent to 2003 to have a material impact on our net income. We do not believe there is a reasonable possibility the total amount of uncertain tax
benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months.

11. Employee and Agent Benefits

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our U.S. employees and certain agents. Some of these plans provide supplemental pension benefits to employees and
agents with salaries and/or pension benefits in excess of the qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law. The employees and agents are generally first eligible for the pension plans when they
reach age 21. For plan participants employed prior to January 1, 2002, the pension benefits are based on the greater of a final average pay benefit or a cash balance benefit. The final average
pay benefit is based on the years of service and generally the employee's or agent's average annual compensation during the last five years of employment. Partial benefit accrual of final average pay
benefits is recognized from first eligibility until retirement based on attained service divided by potential service to age 65 with a minimum of 35 years of potential service. The cash balance
portion of the plan started on January 1, 2002. An employee's account is credited with an amount based on the employee's salary, age and service. These credits accrue with interest. For plan
participants hired on and after January 1, 2002, only the cash balance plan applies. Our policy is to fund the cost of
providing pension benefits in the years that the employees and agents are providing service to us. Our funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plan is to contribute an amount annually at
least equal to the minimum annual contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for
federal income tax purposes. Our funding policy for the nonqualified benefit plan is to fund the plan in the years the employees are providing service, taking into account the funded status of the
trust. While we designate assets to cover the computed liability of the nonqualified plan, the assets are not included as part of the asset balances presented in this footnote as they do not qualify
as plan assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

We
also provide certain health care, life insurance and long-term care benefits for retired employees. Subsidized retiree health benefits are provided for employees hired prior to
January 1, 2002 and who retire prior to January 1, 2020. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2002, or hired prior to January 1, 2002, and who retire on or after
January 1, 2020, have access to retiree health benefits but it is intended that they pay for the full cost of the coverage. The health care plans are contributory with participants'
contributions adjusted annually. The contributions are based on the number of years of service and age at retirement for those hired prior to January 1, 2002, and who retired prior to
January 1, 2011. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2002, and who retire on or after January 1, 2011, but prior to January 1, 2020, the contributions are 60% of the
expected cost. As part of the substantive plan, the retiree health contributions are assumed to be adjusted in the future as claim levels change. The life insurance plans are contributory for a small
group of previously grandfathered participants that have elected supplemental coverage and dependent coverage. The retiree group term life coverage is not subsidized for those who retire on or after
January 1, 2020.

Covered
employees are first eligible for the health and life postretirement benefits when they reach age 57 and have completed ten years of service with us. Retiree long-term care
benefits are provided for employees whose retirement was

The
accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2,821.1 million and $2,799.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Employer
contributions to the pension plans include contributions made directly to the qualified pension plan assets and contributions from corporate assets to pay nonqualified pension
benefits. Benefits paid from the pension plans include both qualified and nonqualified plan benefits. Nonqualified pension plan assets are not included as part of the asset balances presented in this
footnote. The nonqualified pension plan assets are held in Rabbi trusts for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. The assets held in a Rabbi trust are available to satisfy the claims of
general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy. Therefore, these assets are fully consolidated in our consolidated statements of financial position and are not reflected in our funded status as
they do not qualify as plan assets under U.S. GAAP. The market value of assets held in these trusts was $341.0 million and $330.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

Pension Plan Changes and Plan Gains/Losses

On January 1, 2010, benefits under the Principal Pension Plan were frozen for certain participants.

For
the year ended December 31, 2016, the pension plans had an actuarial loss primarily due to assumption changes, including the decrease in the discount rate. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, the pension plans had an actuarial gain primarily due to the increase in discount rate offset by less than expected investment returns.

Other Postretirement Plan Changes and Plan Gains/Losses

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Medicare Modernization Act") provides a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare ("Medicare Part D") as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree medical benefit plans. During each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the
Medicare subsidies we received and accrued for were $0.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

Effective
October 31, 2016, subsidies were eliminated for pre-65 retiree medical, retiree dental, and retiree group term life coverage for employees and agents who retire on or
after January 1, 2020. The amendment to the OPEB plan resulted in a remeasurement, which resulted in a change in discount rate. This plan amendment reduced our accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by $51.6 million.

Effective
January 1, 2016, post-65 medical coverage for employees who retired from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2010, transitioned from a traditional medical
plan to a stipend health reimbursement arrangement. This plan change reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $15.5 million as of December 31, 2015. Offsetting this
reduction is an adjustment in accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (recognized in fourth quarter 2015 expense) of $5.8 million related to dental plan benefits.

For
the year ended December 31, 2016, the other postretirement benefit plans had an actuarial gain primarily due to actual and projected medical claims costs being lower than
previously expected offset by a decrease in the discount rate. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the other postretirement benefit plans had an actuarial loss primarily due to a greater than
expected increase in claim costs and a longer trend rate for participants under age 65.

Information for Pension Plans With an Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets

For 2016 and 2015, both the qualified and nonqualified plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As noted previously,
the nonqualified plans have assets that are deposited in trusts that fail to meet the U.S. GAAP requirements to be included in plan assets; however, these assets are included in our
consolidated statements of financial position.

The
pension plans' actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of plan participants. For the qualified
pension plan, gains and losses are amortized without use of the 10% allowable corridor. For the nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, the corridors allowed are used.

The
funded statuses of the affected plans were remeasured as of October 31, 2016, and a portion of the impact was reflected in the 2016 net periodic
postretirement benefit cost. A discount rate of 4.15% was used until the remeasurement date at which time a discount rate of 3.35% was used.

The
assumed salary growth rates used to project benefits for the projected benefit obligation are age-based for home office employees. The rate labeled cash balance benefit (relative to
employees accruing a cash balance) is the lifecount-weighted average rate of salary growth in the coming year only, as the impact of salary assumption for cash balance benefits are limited to the
upcoming year service cost. The rate labeled traditional benefit (relative to employees still accruing a final average pay benefit) is the lifecount-weighted average (at each age) of the single annual
growth rate at the age that is equivalent to applying the scale from that age to age 65.

For
the pension benefits, the discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligation and discounting those cash flows using a spot
yield curve for high quality corporate bonds. The plans' expected benefit payments are discounted to determine a present value using the yield curve and the discount rate is the level rate that
produces the same present value. The expected return on plan assets is the long-term rate we expect to be earned based on the plans' investment strategy. Historical and expected future returns of

classes
were analyzed to develop a risk free rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class. The overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component,
the risk free real rate of return and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on those overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plans.

For
other postretirement benefits, the discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments inherent in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, and discounting
those cash flows using a spot yield curve for high quality corporate bonds. The plans' expected benefit payments are discounted to determine a present value using the yield curve and the discount rate
is the level rate that produces the same present value. The 5.24% expected long-term return on plan assets for 2016 was based on the weighted average expected long-term asset returns for the medical,
life and long-term care plans. The expected long-term rates for the medical under age 65, medical age 65 and over, life and long-term care plans were 5.20%, 5.10%, 5.70% and 4.25%, respectively.

Pension Plan and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date (an exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels.

•

Level 1 — Fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Our
Level 1 assets include cash, fixed income investment funds, exchange traded equity securities and alternative mutual fund investments.

•

Level 2 — Fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset, either directly or indirectly. Our Level 2 assets primarily include fixed income and equity investment funds and real estate investments.

•

Level 3 — Fair values are based on significant unobservable inputs for the asset. Our Level 3 assets include a
Principal Life general account investment.

Our
pension plan assets consist of investments in separate accounts. Net asset value ("NAV") of the separate accounts is calculated in a manner consistent with U.S. GAAP for
investment companies and is determinative of their fair value. Several of the separate accounts invest in publicly quoted mutual funds or actively managed stocks. The fair value of the underlying
mutual funds or stock is used to determine the NAV of the separate account, which is not publicly quoted. Some of the separate accounts also invest in fixed income securities. The fair value of the
underlying securities is based on quoted prices of similar assets and used to determine the NAV of the separate account. Some of the separate accounts invest in real estate properties. The fair value
is based on discounted cash flow valuation models that utilize public real estate market data inputs such as transaction prices, market rent growth, vacancy levels, leasing absorption, market
capitalization rates and discount rates.

Our
other postretirement benefit plan assets consist of cash, investments in fixed income security portfolios, investments in equity security portfolios, investments in alternative
mutual fund portfolios and investment in a real estate



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

mutual
fund. Because of the nature of cash, its carrying amount approximates fair value. The fair value of fixed income investment funds, U.S. equity portfolios and international equity portfolios is
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the alternative mutual fund portfolios and the real estate mutual fund are based on quoted market prices, which
represent NAV of shares held by the other postretirement benefit plan. The fair value of the Principal Life general account investment is the amount the plan would receive if withdrawing funds from
this participating contract. The amount that would be received is calculated using a cash-out factor based on an associated pool of general account fixed income securities. The cash-out factor is a
ratio of the asset investment value of these securities to asset book value. As the investment values change, the cash-out factor is adjusted, impacting the amount the plan receives at measurement
date. To determine investment value for each category of assets, we project cash flows. This is done using contractual provisions for the assets, with adjustment for expected prepayments and call
provisions. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value for each asset category. Interest rates for discounting are based on current rates on similar new assets in the general account based
on asset strategy.

Pension Plan Assets

We
have established an investment policy that provides the investment objectives and guidelines for the pension plan. Our investment strategy is to achieve the
following:

•

Obtain a reasonable long-term return consistent with the level of risk assumed and at a cost of operation within prudent levels. Performance
benchmarks are monitored.

•

Ensure sufficient liquidity to meet the emerging benefit liabilities for the plan.

•

Provide for diversification of assets in an effort to avoid the risk of large losses and maximize the investment return to the pension plan
consistent with market and economic risk.

In
administering the qualified pension plan's asset allocation strategy, we consider the projected liability stream of benefit payments, the relationship between current and projected
assets of the plan and the projected actuarial
liabilities streams, the historical performance of capital markets adjusted for the perception of future short- and long-term capital market performance and the perception of future economic
conditions.

According
to our investment policy, the target asset allocation for the qualified plan is:

Asset category

Target allocation

U.S. equity portfolios

0% - 45%

International equity portfolios

0% - 15%

Fixed income security portfolios

30% - 100%

The investment strategies and policies for the other postretirement benefit plans are similar to those employed by the qualified pension plan. According to our investment policy, the
target asset allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is:

Contributions

Our funding policy for the qualified pension plan is to fund the plan annually in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contribution
required under ERISA and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. We do not anticipate contributions will be needed to satisfy the minimum
funding requirements of ERISA for our qualified plan. We are unable to estimate the amount that may be contributed, but it is possible that we may fund the plans in 2017 up to $125 million.
This includes funding for both our qualified and nonqualified pension plans. While we designate assets to cover the computed liability of the nonqualified plan, the assets are not included as part of
the asset balances presented in this footnote as they do not qualify as plan assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We may contribute to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2017 pending
future analysis.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, and the expected amount of subsidy receipts under Medicare

Defined Contribution and Deferred Compensation Plans

In addition, we have defined contribution plans that are generally available to all U.S. employees and agents. Eligible participants could not
contribute more than $18,000 of their compensation to the plans in 2016. Effective January 1, 2006, we made several changes to the retirement programs. In general, the pension and supplemental
executive retirement plan benefit formulas were reduced, and the 401(k) matching contribution was increased. Employees who were ages 47 or older with at least ten years of service on
December 31, 2005, could elect to retain the prior benefit provisions and forgo receipt of the additional matching contributions. The employees who elected to retain the prior benefit
provisions are referred to as "Grandfathered Choice Participants." We match the Grandfathered Choice Participant's contribution at a 50% contribution rate up to a maximum matching contribution of 3%
of the participant's compensation. For all other participants, we match the participant's contributions at a 75% contribution rate up to a maximum matching contribution of 6% of the participant's
compensation. The defined contribution plans allow employees to choose among various investment options, including our common stock, which is available through our Employee Stock Ownership Plan
("ESOP"). We contributed $46.6 million, $45.7 million and $41.7 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to our qualified defined contribution plans.

The
number of shares of our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was 2.4 million as of both December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and
2015, the fair value of the ESOP, which includes earned and unearned common stock, was $137.9 million and $108.4 million, respectively. The ESOP's total assets include our
common stock and cash. The ESOP purchases our common stock on the open market. The number of shares of our common stock held within the ESOP is treated as outstanding in both our basic and diluted
earnings per share calculations.

We
also have nonqualified deferred compensation plans available to select employees and agents that allow them to defer compensation amounts in excess of limits imposed by federal tax
law with respect to the qualified plans. For certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans that include an employer matching contribution, in 2016 we matched the

11. Employee and Agent Benefits — (continued)

Grandfathered
Choice Participant's deferral at a 50% match deferral rate up to a maximum matching deferral of 3% of the participant's compensation. For all other participants in nonqualified deferred
compensation plans that include an employer matching contribution, we matched the participant's deferral at a 75% match deferral rate up to a maximum matching deferral of 6% of the participant's
compensation. We contributed $3.3 million, $4.5 million and $4.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans.

12. Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications

Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies

We are regularly involved in litigation, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff, but primarily as a defendant. Litigation naming us as a
defendant ordinarily arises out of our business operations as a provider of asset management and accumulation products and services; individual life insurance, specialty benefits insurance and our
investment activities. Some of the lawsuits may be class actions, or purport to be, and some may include claims for unspecified or substantial punitive and treble damages.

We
may discuss such litigation in one of three ways. We accrue a charge to income and disclose legal matters for which the chance of loss is probable and for which the amount of loss can
be reasonably estimated. We may disclose
contingencies for which the chance of loss is reasonably possible and provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. Finally, we may
voluntarily disclose loss contingencies for which the chance of loss is remote in order to provide information concerning matters that potentially expose us to possible losses.

In
addition, regulatory bodies such as state insurance departments, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor and other regulatory agencies regularly
make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws, ERISA and laws governing the activities of
broker-dealers. We receive requests from regulators and other governmental authorities relating to industry issues and may receive additional requests, including subpoenas and interrogatories, in the
future.

On
December 30, 2015, Mary Ventura, William Littlejohn and Ryan Kadota filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa against Principal
Management Corporation ("PMC"). The lawsuit alleges PMC breached its fiduciary duty under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act by charging excessive fees on the LargeCap Growth I Fund,
SmallCap Growth I Fund, SmallCap Fund, High Yield Fund, MidCap Fund and the MidCap Value III Fund. PMC is aggressively defending the lawsuit.

On
August 29, 2013, American Chemicals & Equipment, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan ("ACE") filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Alabama against PMC and Principal Global Investors, LLC (the "ACE Defendants"). The lawsuit alleges the ACE Defendants breached their fiduciary duty under Section 36(b) of the
Investment Company Act by charging excessive fees on certain of the LifeTime series target date funds. On January 24, 2014, the court granted the motion filed by the ACE Defendants to transfer
the case to the Southern District of Iowa. The ACE Defendants were granted summary judgment and the case was dismissed. ACE has appealed that grant of summary judgment and subsequent dismissal to the
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The ACE Defendants continue to aggressively defend the lawsuit.

In
2008, Principal Life received approximately $440.0 million in connection with the termination of certain structured transactions and the resulting prepayment of Principal
Life's investment in those transactions. The transactions involved Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (collectively, "Lehman") in various
capacities. Subsequent to Lehman's 2008 bankruptcy filing, its bankruptcy estate initiated several lawsuits seeking to recover from numerous sources significant amounts to which it claims entitlement
under various theories. We are one of a large group of defendants to this action. The estate's claim against Principal Life, including interest, was approximately $600.0 million. On
June 28, 2016, the bankruptcy court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss directed at common issues and dismissed with prejudice all claims against Principal Life. Defendants, including
Principal Life, have requested that the bankruptcy court issue an order directing entry of final judgment consistent with its June 28, 2016, decision. Lehman has the right to appeal an order of
final judgment.

While
the outcome of any pending or future litigation or regulatory matter cannot be predicted, management does not believe any such matter will have a material adverse effect on our
business or financial position. As of December 31, 2016, we had no estimated losses accrued related to the legal matters discussed above because we believe the chance of loss from these matters
is not probable and the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.

We
believe all of the litigation contingencies discussed above involve a chance of loss that is either remote or reasonably possible. Unless otherwise noted, all of these matters involve
unspecified claim amounts, in which the



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

December 31, 2016

12. Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnifications — (continued)

respective
plaintiffs seek an indeterminate amount of damages. To the extent such matters present a reasonably possible chance of loss, we are generally not able to estimate the possible loss or range
of loss associated therewith.

The
outcome of such matters is always uncertain, and unforeseen results can occur. It is possible such outcomes could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish
accruals in amounts we could not estimate as of December 31, 2016.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, we have provided guarantees to third parties primarily related to former subsidiaries and joint ventures. The
terms of these agreements range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. The maximum exposure under these agreements as of December 31, 2016, was approximately $172.0 million.
At inception, the fair value of such guarantees was insignificant. In addition, we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required. Therefore, any liability accrued within our
consolidated statements of financial position is insignificant. Should we be required to perform under these guarantees, we generally could recover a portion of the loss from third parties through
recourse provisions included in agreements with such parties, the sale of assets held as collateral that can be liquidated in the event performance is required under the guarantees or other recourse
generally available to us; therefore, such guarantees would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. While the likelihood is remote, such outcomes could
materially affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period.

We
manage mandatory privatized social security funds in Chile. By regulation, we have a required minimum guarantee on the funds' relative return. Because the guarantee has no limitation
with respect to duration or amount, the maximum exposure of the guarantee in the future is indeterminable.

We
are also subject to various other indemnification obligations issued in conjunction with divestitures, acquisitions and financing transactions whose terms range in duration and often
are not explicitly defined. Certain portions of these indemnifications may be capped, while other portions are not subject to such limitations; therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation
under the indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. At inception, the fair value of such indemnifications was insignificant. In addition, we believe the likelihood is remote that material
payments will be required. Therefore, any liability accrued within our consolidated statements of financial position is insignificant. While we are unable to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal
and financial liability with respect to these indemnifications, we believe that performance under these indemnifications would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial
position. While the likelihood is remote, performance under these indemnifications could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period.

Guaranty Funds

Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, for certain obligations
of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. A state's fund assesses its members based on their pro rata market share of written premiums in the state for the classes of
insurance for which the insolvent insurer was engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. We accrue liabilities for guaranty
fund assessments when an assessment is probable, can be reasonably estimated and when the event obligating us to pay has occurred. While we cannot predict the amount and timing of any future
assessments, we have established reserves we believe are adequate for assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings. As of December 31, 2016
and 2015, the liability balance for guaranty fund assessments, which is not discounted, was $14.9 million and $15.1 million, respectively, and was reported within other liabilities in
the consolidated statements of financial position. As of both December 31, 2016 and 2015, $5.7 million related to premium tax offsets were included in premiums due and other receivables
in the consolidated statements of financial position.

Operating Leases

As a lessee, we lease office space, data processing equipment, office furniture and office equipment under various operating leases. Rental
expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was $40.4 million, $38.0 million and $37.3 million, respectively.

13. Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock

On June 30, 2015 we redeemed our 3.0 million shares of series A preferred stock for $300.0 million and our
10.0 million shares of series B preferred stock for $250.0 million. At redemption, we recognized $8.2 million excess redemption value over carrying value of the preferred
shares redeemed as an adjustment to determine net income available to common stockholders.

Dividend Payments

On March 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, we paid a dividend of $8.2 million and $8.3 million, respectively, equal to
$1.39 per share on Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and equal to $0.41 per share on Series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. Dividends were paid to
stockholders of record as of March 12, 2015 and June 11, 2015, respectively.

On
April 1, 2014; June 30, 2014; September 30, 2014 and December 30, 2014, we paid a dividend of $8.2 million, $8.3 million, $8.2 million

Noncontrolling Interest

Interests held by unaffiliated parties in consolidated entities are reflected in noncontrolling interest, which represents the noncontrolling
partners' share of the underlying net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest that is not redeemable is reported in the equity section of the consolidated statements of
financial position.

The
noncontrolling interest holders in certain of our consolidated entities maintain an equity interest that is redeemable at the option of the holder, which may be exercised on varying
dates. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, this interest is presented on the consolidated statements of financial position line item titled "Redeemable
noncontrolling interest." Our redeemable noncontrolling interest primarily relates to consolidated sponsored investment funds for which interests are redeemed at fair value from the net assets of the
funds.

For
our redeemable noncontrolling interest related to other consolidated subsidiaries, redemptions are required to be purchased at fair value or a value based on a formula that
management intended to reasonably approximate fair value based on a fixed multiple of earnings over a measurement period. The carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is compared to
the redemption value at each reporting period. Any adjustments to the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest for changes in redemption value prior to exercise of the redemption
option are determined after the attribution of net income or loss of the subsidiary and are recognized in the redemption value as they occur. Adjustments to the carrying value of redeemable
noncontrolling interest result in adjustments to additional paid-in capital and/or retained earnings. Adjustments are recorded in retained earnings to the extent the redemption value of the redeemable
noncontrolling interest exceeds its fair value and will impact the numerator in our earnings per share calculations. All other adjustments to the redeemable noncontrolling interest are recorded in
additional paid-in capital.

(1)

During
the third quarter of 2014, we increased our ownership stake in Columbus Circle Investors.

(2)

Effective
January 1, 2016, certain sponsored investment funds were consolidated as a result of the implementation of new accounting guidance. See
Note 3, Variable Interest Entities, for further details.

(3)

We
deconsolidated certain sponsored investment funds as they no longer met the requirements for consolidation.

Dividend Limitations

The declaration and payment of our common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our overall
financial condition, results of operations, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, receipt of dividends from Principal Life (as described below), risk management considerations and other
factors deemed relevant by the Board. No significant restrictions limit the payment of dividends by us, except those generally applicable to corporations incorporated in Delaware.

Under
Iowa law, Principal Life may pay stockholder dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the Commissioner of Insurance
of the State of Iowa (the "Commissioner") to pay a stockholder dividend if such a stockholder dividend would exceed certain statutory limitations. In general, the current statutory limitation is the
greater of 10% of Principal Life's policyholder surplus as of the preceding year-end or the net gain from operations from the previous calendar year. Based on this limitation and 2016 statutory
results, Principal Life could pay approximately $1,143.3 million in stockholder dividends in 2017 without exceeding the statutory limitation.

14. Fair Value Measurements

We use fair value measurements to record fair value of certain assets and liabilities and to estimate fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value but required to be
disclosed at fair value. Certain financial instruments, particularly policyholder liabilities other than investment contracts, are excluded from these fair value disclosure requirements.

14. Fair Value Measurements — (continued)

Valuation Hierarchy

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety
considering factors specific to the asset or liability.

•

Level 1

— Fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Our Level 1 assets and liabilities primarily include exchange traded equity securities, mutual funds and U.S. Treasury bonds.

•

Level 2

— Fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Our Level 2 assets and liabilities primarily include fixed maturities (including public and
private bonds), equity securities, cash equivalents, derivatives and other investments.

•

Level 3

— Fair values are based on at least one significant
unobservable input for the asset or liability. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily include fixed maturities, real estate and commercial mortgage loan investments of our separate
accounts, complex derivatives and embedded derivatives.

Determination of Fair Value

The following discussion describes the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis or disclosed at fair value. The techniques utilized in estimating the fair value of financial instruments are reliant on the assumptions used. Care should be exercised in deriving conclusions
about our business, its value or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below.

Fair
value estimates are made based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument at a specific point in time. Such estimates do not consider the tax
impact of the realization of unrealized gains or losses. In addition, the disclosed fair value may not be realized in the immediate settlement of the financial instrument. We validate prices through
an investment analyst review process, which includes validation through direct interaction with external sources, review of recent trade activity or use of internal models. In circumstances where
broker quotes are used to value an instrument, we generally receive one non-binding quote. Broker quotes are validated through an investment analyst review process, which includes validation through
direct interaction with external sources and use
of internal models or other relevant information. We did not make any significant changes to our valuation processes during 2016.

Fixed Maturities

Fixed maturities include bonds, ABS, redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities. When available, the fair value
of fixed maturities is based on quoted prices of identical assets in active markets. These are reflected in Level 1 and primarily include U.S. Treasury bonds and actively traded redeemable
corporate preferred securities.

When
quoted prices of identical assets in active markets are not available, our first priority is to obtain prices from third party pricing vendors. We have regular interaction with
these vendors to ensure we understand their pricing methodologies and to confirm they are utilizing observable market information. Their methodologies vary by asset class and include inputs such as
estimated cash flows, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker quotes, credit quality, industry events and economic events. Fixed maturities with validated prices from pricing services, which
includes the majority of our public fixed maturities in all asset classes, are generally reflected in Level 2. Also included in Level 2 are corporate bonds where quoted market prices are
not available, for which an internal model using substantially all observable inputs or a matrix pricing valuation approach is used. In the matrix approach, securities are grouped into pricing
categories that vary by sector, rating and average life. Each pricing category is assigned a risk spread based on studies of observable public market data from the investment professionals assigned to
specific security classes. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted back at the current Treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread. Although the matrix valuation approach
provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an individual security within each pricing category may actually be impacted by company specific factors.

If
we are unable to price a fixed maturity security using prices from third party pricing vendors or other sources specific to the asset class, we may obtain a broker quote or utilize an
internal pricing model specific to the asset utilizing relevant market information, to the extent available and where at least one significant unobservable input is utilized. These are reflected in
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and can include fixed maturities across all asset classes. As of



Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

December 31, 2016

14. Fair Value Measurements — (continued)

December 31,
2016, less than 1% of our total fixed maturities were Level 3 securities valued using internal pricing models.

The
primary inputs, by asset class, for valuations of the majority of our Level 2 investments from third party pricing vendors or our internal pricing valuation approach are
described below.

U.S. Government and Agencies/Non-U.S. Governments.

Inputs include recently executed market transactions, interest rate yield
curves, maturity dates,
market price quotations and credit spreads relating to similar instruments.

States and Political Subdivisions.

Inputs include Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board reported trades, U.S. Treasury and other
benchmark curves,
material event notices, new issue data and obligor credit ratings.

Corporate.

Inputs include recently executed transactions, market price quotations, benchmark yields, issuer spreads and
observations of equity and
credit default swap curves related to the issuer. For private placement corporate securities valued through the matrix valuation approach inputs include the current Treasury curve and risk spreads
based on sector, rating and average life of the issuance.

RMBS, CMBS, Collateralized Debt Obligations and Other Debt Obligations.

Inputs include cash flows, priority of the tranche in
the capital structure,
expected time to maturity for the specific tranche, reinvestment period remaining and performance of the underlying collateral including prepayments, defaults, deferrals, loss severity of defaulted
collateral and, for RMBS, prepayment speed assumptions. Other inputs include market indices and recently executed market transactions.

Equity Securities

Equity securities include mutual funds, common stock, non-redeemable preferred stock and required regulatory investments. Fair values of equity
securities are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets when available, which are reflected in Level 1. When quoted prices are not available, we may utilize
internal valuation methodologies appropriate for the specific asset that use observable inputs such as underlying share prices or the NAV, which are reflected in Level 2. Fair values might also
be determined using broker quotes or through the use of internal models or analysis that incorporate significant assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other
market participants would use when pricing such securities, which are reflected in Level 3.

Derivatives

The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives are determined through quoted market prices, which are reflected in Level 1.
Exchange-traded derivatives include futures that are settled daily such that their fair value is not reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position. The fair values of derivative
instruments cleared through centralized clearinghouses are determined through market prices published by the clearinghouses, which are reflected in Level 2. The clearinghouses may utilize the
overnight indexed swap ("OIS") curve in their valuation. The fair values of bilateral OTC derivative instruments are determined using either pricing valuation models that utilize market observable
inputs or broker quotes. The majority of our bilateral OTC derivatives are valued with models that use market observable inputs, which are reflected in Level 2. Significant inputs include
contractual terms, interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spread curves, equity prices and volatilities. These valuation models consider projected discounted cash flows, relevant swap curves
and appropriate implied volatilities. Certain bilateral OTC derivatives utilize unobservable market data, primarily independent broker quotes that are nonbinding quotes based on models that do not
reflect the result of market transactions, which are reflected in Level 3.

Our
non-cleared derivative contracts are generally documented under ISDA Master Agreements, which provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific
counterparties. Collateral arrangements are bilateral and based on current ratings of each entity. We utilize the LIBOR interest rate curve to value our positions, which includes a credit spread. This
credit spread incorporates an appropriate level of nonperformance risk into our valuations given the current ratings of our counterparties, as well as the collateral agreements in place. Counterparty
credit risk is routinely monitored to ensure our adjustment for non-performance risk is appropriate. Our centrally cleared derivative contracts are conducted with regulated centralized clearinghouses,
which provide for daily exchange of cash collateral equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts that eliminates the non-performance risk on these trades.

Interest Rate Contracts.

For non-cleared contracts we use discounted cash flow valuation techniques to determine the fair value
of interest rate
swaps using observable swap curves as the inputs. These are reflected in Level 2. For centrally cleared contracts we use published prices from clearinghouses. These are reflected in
Level 2. In addition, we have a

December 31, 2016

14. Fair Value Measurements — (continued)

limited
number of complex inflation-linked interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and swaptions that are valued using broker quotes. These are reflected in Level 3.

Foreign Exchange Contracts.

We use discounted cash flow valuation techniques that utilize observable swap curves and exchange
rates as the inputs to
determine the fair value of foreign currency swaps. These are reflected in Level 2. Currency forwards are valued using observable market inputs, including forward currency exchange rates. These
are reflected in Level 2. In addition, we have a limited number of non-standard currency swaps that are valued using broker quotes. These are reflected within Level 3.

Equity Contracts.

We use an option pricing model using observable implied volatilities, dividend yields, index prices and swap
curves as the inputs
to determine the fair value of equity options. These are reflected in Level 2.

Credit Contracts.

We use either the ISDA Credit Default Swap Standard discounted cash flow model that utilizes observable default
probabilities and
recovery rates as inputs or broker prices to determine the fair value of credit default swaps. These are reflected in Level 3. In addition, we have a limited number of total return swaps that
are valued based on the observable quoted price of underlying equity indices. These are reflected in Level 2.

Other Investments

Other investments reported at fair value include invested assets of consolidated sponsored investment funds, unconsolidated sponsored investment
funds, other investment funds reported at fair value or for which the fair value option was elected, commercial mortgage loans of consolidated VIEs for which the fair value option was elected and
equity method real estate investments for which the fair value option was elected.

Invested
assets of consolidated sponsored investment funds include equity securities, fixed maturities and other investments, for which fair values are determined as previously
described, and are reflected in Level 1 and Level 2.

The
fair value of unconsolidated sponsored investment funds and other investment funds is determined using the NAV of the fund. The NAV of the fund represents the price at which we feel
we would be able to initiate a transaction. Investments for which the NAV represents a quoted price in an active market for identical assets are reflected in Level 1. Investments that do not
have a quoted price in an active market are reflected in Level 2.

Commercial
mortgage loans of consolidated VIEs valued using the measurement alternative for CCFEs are reflected in Level 2. These investments are based on the more observable fair
value of the liabilities of the consolidated VIEs. The liabilities are affiliated so are not reflected in our consolidated results.

Equity
method real estate investments for which the fair value option was elected are reflected in Level 3. The equity method real estate investments consist of underlying real
estate and debt. The real estate fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model that utilizes public real estate market data inputs such as transaction prices, market rents,
vacancy levels, leasing absorption, market cap rates and discount rates. The debt fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our incremental borrowing rate for similar
borrowing arrangements.

Cash Equivalents

Certain cash equivalents are reported at fair value on a recurring basis and include money market instruments and other short-term investments
with maturities of three months or less. Fair values of these cash equivalents may be determined using public quotations, when available, which are reflected in Level 1. When public quotations
are not available, because of the highly liquid nature of these assets, carrying amounts may be used to approximate fair values, which are reflected in Level 2.

Separate Account Assets

Separate account assets include equity securities, debt securities and derivative instruments, for which fair values are determined as
previously described, and are reflected in Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Separate account assets also include commercial mortgage loans, for which the fair value is
estimated by discounting the
expected total cash flows using market rates that are applicable to the yield, credit quality and maturity of the loans. The market clearing spreads vary based on mortgage type, weighted average life,
rating and liquidity. These are reflected in Level 3. Finally, separate account assets include real estate, for which the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow valuation models
that utilize various public real estate market data inputs. In addition, each property is appraised annually by an independent appraiser. The real estate included in separate account assets is
recorded net of related mortgage encumbrances for which the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on our incremental borrowing rate for similar borrowing arrangements. The
real estate within the separate accounts is reflected in Level 3.

14. Fair Value Measurements — (continued)

Investment Contracts

Certain annuity contracts and other investment contracts include embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated from the host contract and are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which are reflected
in Level 3. The key assumptions for calculating the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities are market assumptions (such as equity market returns, interest rate levels, market
volatility and correlations) and policyholder behavior assumptions (such as lapse, mortality, utilization and withdrawal patterns). Risk margins are included in the policyholder behavior assumptions.
The assumptions are based on a combination of historical data and actuarial judgment. The embedded derivative liabilities are valued using stochastic models that incorporate a spread reflecting our
own creditworthiness.

The
assumption for our own non-performance risk for investment contracts and any embedded derivatives bifurcated from certain annuity and investment contracts is based on the current
market credit spreads for debt-like instruments we have issued and are available in the market.

Other Liabilities

Certain obligations reported in other liabilities include embedded derivatives to deliver underlying securities of structured investments to
third parties. The fair value of the embedded derivatives is calculated based on the value of the underlying securities that are valued based on prices obtained from third party pricing vendors as
utilized and described in our discussion of how fair value is determined for fixed maturities, which are reflected in Level 2.

Additionally,
obligations of consolidated VIEs for which the fair value option was elected are included in other liabilities. The VIEs' unaffiliated obligations are valued utilizing
internal pricing models, which are reflected in Level 3.

(1)

Within
the consolidated statements of financial position, derivative assets are reported with other investments and derivative liabilities are reported with other
liabilities. Refer to Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further information on fair value by class of derivative instruments. Our derivatives are primarily Level 2, with the
exception of certain credit default swaps and other swaps that are Level 3.

(2)

Primarily
includes sponsored investment funds, other investment funds, equity method investments reported at fair value and commercial mortgage loans of consolidated
VIEs.

(3)

Includes
money market instruments and short-term investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased.

(4)

Includes
bifurcated embedded derivatives that are reported at fair value within the same line item in the consolidated statements of financial position in which the
host contract is reported. Other liabilities also include obligations of consolidated VIEs reported at fair value.

(5)

Certain
investments are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and have not been classified in the fair value
hierarchy. These consist of certain fund interests that are restricted until maturity with unfunded commitments totaling $57.6 million and $7.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.

Both
realized gains (losses) and mark-to-market unrealized gains (losses) are generally reported in net realized capital gains (losses) within the consolidated
statements of operations. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on certain fixed maturities, trading and certain derivatives used in relation to certain trading portfolios are reported in net
investment income within the consolidated statements of operations.

(2)

Gains
and losses for separate account assets do not impact net income as the change in value of separate account assets is offset by a change in value of separate
account liabilities. Foreign currency translation adjustments related to the Principal International segment separate account assets are recorded in AOCI and are offset by foreign currency translation
adjustments of the corresponding separate account liabilities.

Transfers
between fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period.

Separate
account assets transferred between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2016, 2015 and 2014, primarily related to foreign equity securities. When these securities are valued
at the close price of the local exchange where the assets traded, they are reflected in Level 1. When events materially affecting the value occur between the close of the local exchange and the
New York Stock Exchange, we use adjusted prices determined by a third party pricing vendor to update the foreign market closing prices and the fair value is reflected in Level 2.

Other
investments transferred from Level 2 into Level 1 during 2015, primarily included assets valued using a NAV with a quoted price in an active market for identical
assets as a result of additional analysis to clarify the source of the quoted price.

Assets
transferred into Level 3 during 2016, 2015 and 2014, primarily included those assets for which we are now unable to obtain pricing from a recognized third party pricing
vendor as well as assets that were previously priced using a matrix valuation approach that may no longer be relevant when applied to asset-specific situations.

Assets
transferred out of Level 3 during 2016, 2015 and 2014, included those for which we are now able to obtain pricing from a recognized third party pricing vendor or from
internal models using substantially all market observable information. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2015, assets transferred out of Level 3 included assets valued using
the measurement alternative for CCFEs for which the corresponding liabilities have the more observable fair value and are reflected in Level 2.

Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements

The following table provides quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for recurring fair value measurements
categorized within Level 3, excluding assets and liabilities for which
significant quantitative unobservable inputs are not developed internally, which primarily consists of those valued using broker quotes or the measurement alternative for CCFEs. Refer to "Assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis" for a complete valuation hierarchy summary.

This
input factor is the number of contractholders taking withdrawals as well as the amount and timing of the withdrawals and a range does not provide a meaningful
presentation.

(4)

This
input is based on an appropriate industry mortality table and a range does not provide a meaningful presentation.

Market
comparable discount rates are used as the base rate in the discounted cash flows used to determine the fair value of certain assets. Increases or decreases in the credit spreads
on the comparable assets could cause the fair value of the assets to significantly decrease or increase, respectively. Additionally, we may adjust the base discount
rate or the modeled price by applying an illiquidity premium given the highly structured nature of certain assets. Increases or decreases in this illiquidity premium could cause significant decreases
or increases, respectively, in the fair value of the asset.

Embedded
derivatives can be either assets or liabilities within the investment contracts line item, depending on certain inputs at the reporting date. Increases to an asset or decreases
to a liability are described as increases to fair value. Increases or decreases in market volatilities could cause significant decreases or increases, respectively, in the fair value of embedded
derivatives in investment contracts. Long duration interest rates are used as the mean return when projecting the growth in the value of associated account value and impact the discount rate used in
the discounted future cash flows valuation. The amount of claims will increase if account value is not sufficient to cover guaranteed withdrawals. Increases or decreases in risk free rates could cause
the fair value of the embedded derivative to significantly increase or decrease, respectively. Increases or decreases in our own credit risks, which impact the rates used to discount future cash
flows, could significantly increase or decrease, respectively, the fair value of the embedded derivative. All of these changes in fair value would impact net income.

Decreases
or increases in the mortality rate assumption could cause the fair value of the embedded derivative to decrease or increase, respectively. Decreases or increases in the overall
lapse rate assumption could cause the fair value of the embedded derivative to decrease or increase, respectively. The lapse rate assumption varies dynamically based on the relationship of the
guarantee and associated account value. A stronger or weaker dynamic lapse rate assumption could cause the fair value of the embedded derivative to decrease or increase, respectively. The utilization
rate assumption includes how many contractholders will take withdrawals, when they will take them and how much of their benefit they will take. Increases or decreases in the assumption of the number
of contractholders taking withdrawals could cause the fair value of the embedded derivative to decrease or increase, respectively. Assuming contractholders take withdrawals earlier or later could
cause the fair value of the embedded derivative to decrease or increase, respectively. Assuming contractholders take more or less of their benefit could cause the fair value of the embedded derivative
to decrease or increase, respectively.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. During 2016, certain mortgage loans had been marked to fair value of
$2.7 million. The net impact of write-downs of loans reclassified to held-for-sale, impairments and improvements in estimated fair value of previously impaired loans resulted in a net loss of
$2.4 million that was recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) as part of the mortgage loan valuation allowance. This includes the impact of certain loans no longer on our books. These
collateral-dependent mortgage loans are a Level 3 fair value measurement, as fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral, which is estimated using appraised
values that involve significant unobservable inputs.

During
2016, certain real estate had been written down to fair value of $13.9 million. This write down resulted in a loss of $5.3 million, of which $4.5 million was
a lower of cost or market adjustment on held-for-sale real estate recorded in net investment income and the remaining $0.8 million was recorded in net realized capital gains (losses). This is a
Level 3 fair value measurement, as the fair value of real estate is estimated based on a discounted cash flow valuation from an internal model. Significant inputs used in the discounted cash
flow calculation include a discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and average market rent growth. The ranges of inputs used in the fair value measurements for the real estate marked to fair value
during 2016 were:

Discount
rate = 10.3%

Terminal capitalization rate = 9.0%

Average market rent growth = 0.0%

During
2015, certain mortgage loans had been marked to fair value of $9.4 million. The net impact of write-downs of loans reclassified to held-for-sale, impairments and
improvements in estimated fair value of previously impaired loans resulted in a net loss of $3.0 million that was recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) as part of the mortgage loan
valuation allowance. This includes the impact of certain loans no longer on our books. These collateral-dependent

mortgage
loans are a Level 3 fair value measurement, as fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral, which is estimated using appraised values that involve
significant unobservable inputs.

During
2015, certain real estate had been written down to fair value of $30.9 million. This write down resulted in a loss of $2.9 million that was recorded in net realized
capital gains (losses). This is a Level 3 fair value measurement, as the fair value of real estate is estimated based on a discounted cash flow valuation from an internal model. Significant
inputs used in the discounted cash flow calculation include a discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and average market rent growth. The ranges of inputs used in the fair value measurements for
the real estate marked to fair value during 2015 were:

Discount
rate = 8.6% - 10.5%

Terminal capitalization rate = 7.3% - 8.5%

Average market rent growth = 2.7% - 3.0%

During
2015, identified intangibles that originated from the acquisition of our mutual fund company in Brazil were deemed to be impaired, and were marked to fair value of zero. These
impairments were driven by the current macroeconomic and market conditions in Brazil, including higher discount rates and change in the mix of business. The fair value calculation for intangibles is a
Level 3 fair value measurement, as the fair value is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows that are expected to emerge from the identified intangibles. The net impact
of impairments of identified intangibles resulted in a loss of $23.0 million that was recorded in operating expenses.

During
2014, certain mortgage loans had been marked to fair value of $68.9 million. The net impact of write-downs of loans reclassified to held-for-sale, impairments and
improvements in estimated fair value of previously impaired loans resulted in a net loss of $10.0 million that was recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) as part of the mortgage loan
valuation allowance. This includes the impact of certain loans no longer on our books. These collateral-dependent mortgage loans are a Level 3 fair value measurement, as fair value is based on
the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral, which is estimated using appraised values that involve significant unobservable inputs. The fair value of the underlying collateral is
determined based on a discounted cash flow valuation either from an external broker opinion of value or an internal model. Significant inputs used in the discounted cash flow calculation include: a
discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and average market rent growth. The ranges of inputs used in the fair value measurements for the mortgage loans marked to fair value during 2014 were:

Discount
rate = 8.8% - 11.0%

Terminal capitalization rate = 7.3% - 9.0%

Average market rent growth = 2.0% - 10.9%

During
2014, certain real estate had been written down to fair value of $22.3 million. This write down resulted in a loss of $6.2 million that was recorded in net realized
capital gains (losses). This is a Level 3 fair value measurement, as the fair value of real estate is estimated based on a discounted cash flow valuation from an internal model. Significant
inputs used in the discounted cash flow calculation include a discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and average market rent growth. The ranges of inputs used in the fair value measurements for
the real estate marked to fair value during 2014 were:

Discount
rate = 9.6% - 11.8%

Terminal capitalization rate = 8.3% - 8.5%

Average market rent growth = 3.0% - 3.6%

Fair Value Option

We elected fair value accounting for:

•

Certain commercial mortgage loans and obligations of consolidated VIEs for which it was not practicable for us to determine the carrying value.

•

Certain real estate ventures that are subject to the equity method of accounting because the nature of the investments is to add value to the
properties and generate income from the operations of the properties. Other equity method real estate investments are not fair valued because the investments mainly generate income from the operations
of the underlying properties.

•

Certain investment funds for which we do not have enough influence to account for under the equity method in order to reflect the economics of
the investment in the financial statements. We do not elect the fair value option for other similar investments as these investments are generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Mortgage Loans

Fair values of commercial and residential mortgage loans are primarily determined by discounting the expected cash flows at current treasury
rates plus an applicable risk spread, which reflects credit quality and maturity of the loans. The risk spread is based on market clearing levels for loans with comparable credit quality, maturities
and risk. The fair value of mortgage loans may also be based on the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral less cost to sell, which is estimated using appraised values. These are
reflected in Level 3.

Policy Loans

Fair values of policy loans are estimated by discounting expected cash flows using a risk-free rate based on the Treasury curve. The expected
cash flows reflect an estimate of timing of the repayment of the loans. These are reflected in Level 3.

Other Investments

The fair value of commercial loans and certain consumer loans included in other investments is calculated by discounting expected cash flows
through the estimated maturity date using market interest rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loans. The estimate of term to maturity is based on historical
experience, adjusted as required, for current economic and lending conditions. The effect of non-performing loans is considered in assessing the credit risk inherent in the fair value estimate. These
are reflected in Level 3. The fair value of certain tax credit investments are estimated by discounting expected future tax benefits using estimated investment return rates. These are reflected
in Level 3. The carrying value of the remaining investments reported in this line item approximate their fair value. These are reflected in Level 2.

14. Fair Value Measurements — (continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Certain cash equivalents not reported at fair value include short-term investments with maturities of three months or less for which public
quotations are not available to use in determining fair value. Because of the highly liquid nature of these assets, carrying amounts are used to approximate fair value, which are reflected in
Level 2. The carrying amount of the remaining cash approximates its fair value, which is reflected in Level 1 given the nature of cash.

Investment Contracts

The fair values of our reserves and liabilities for investment contracts are determined via a third party pricing vendor or using discounted
cash flow analyses when we are unable to find a price from third party pricing vendors. Third party pricing on various outstanding medium-term notes and funding agreements is based on observable
inputs such as benchmark yields and spreads based on reported trades for our medium-term notes and funding agreement issuances. These are reflected in Level 2. The discounted cash flow analyses
for the remaining contracts is based on current interest rates, including non-performance risk, being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the investment
contracts being valued. These are reflected in Level 3. Investment contracts include insurance, annuity and other policy contracts that do not involve significant mortality or morbidity risk
and are only a portion of the policyholder liabilities appearing in the consolidated statements of financial position. Insurance contracts include insurance, annuity and other policy contracts that do
involve significant mortality or morbidity risk. The fair values for our insurance contracts, other than investment contracts, are not required to be disclosed.

Short-Term Debt

The carrying amount of short-term debt approximates its fair value because of the relatively short time between origination of the debt
instrument and its maturity, which is reflected in Level 2.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt primarily includes senior note issuances for which the fair values are determined using inputs that are observable in the market
or that can be derived from or corroborated with observable market data. These are reflected in Level 2. Additionally, our long-term debt includes non-recourse mortgages and notes payable that
are primarily financings for real estate developments for which the fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on our incremental borrowing rate for similar borrowing
arrangements. These are reflected in Level 3.

Separate Account Liabilities

Fair values of separate account liabilities, excluding insurance-related elements, are estimated based on market assumptions around what a
potential acquirer would pay for the associated block of business, including both the separate account assets and liabilities. As the applicable separate account assets are already reflected at fair
value, any adjustment to the fair value of the block is an assumed adjustment to the separate account liabilities. To compute fair value, the separate account liabilities are originally set to equal
separate account assets because these are pass-through contracts. The separate account liabilities are reduced by the amount of future fees expected to be collected that are intended to offset upfront
acquisition costs already incurred that a potential acquirer would not have to pay. The estimated future fees are adjusted by an adverse deviation discount and the amount is then discounted at a
risk-free rate as measured by the yield on Treasury securities at maturities aligned with the estimated timing of fee collection. These are reflected in Level 3.

Bank Deposits

The fair value of deposits of our Principal Bank subsidiary with no stated maturity is equal to the amount payable on demand (i.e., their
carrying amounts). These are reflected in Level 1. The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount is estimated using the
rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. These are reflected in Level 2.

Cash Collateral Payable

The carrying amount of the payable associated with our obligation to return the cash collateral received under derivative credit support annex
(collateral) agreements approximates its fair value, which is reflected in Level 1.

15. Statutory Insurance Financial Information

Principal Life, the largest indirect subsidiary of PFG, prepares statutory financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Insurance
Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa (the "State of Iowa"). The State of Iowa recognizes only statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Iowa for
determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company to determine its solvency under the Iowa Insurance Law. The National Association of Insurance
Commissioners' ("NAIC") Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual has been adopted as a component of prescribed practices by the State of Iowa. The Commissioner has the right to permit other specific
practices that deviate from prescribed practices. For the years ended, December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Principal Life's use of prescribed statutory accounting practices resulted in higher
(lower) statutory net income of $3.8 million, $(2.1) million and $6.4 million, respectively, relative to the accounting practices and procedures of the NAIC due to its accounting for
derivatives that hedge some of its equity indexed products. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Principal Life's permitted statutory accounting practice relating to variable
annuities with a guaranteed living benefit rider resulted in lower statutory surplus of $180.5 million and $158.1 million, respectively, relative to carrying certain interest rate swaps
at book value rather than fair value, as if they received hedge accounting treatment for statutory. Statutory accounting practices differ from U.S. GAAP primarily due to charging policy
acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing reserves using different actuarial assumptions, valuing investments on a different basis and not admitting certain assets, including certain net
deferred income tax assets.

Principal
Life cedes certain term and universal life insurance statutory reserves to our affiliated reinsurance subsidiaries on a funds withheld coinsurance basis. The reserves are
secured by cash, invested assets and financing provided by highly rated third parties. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our affiliated reinsurance subsidiaries assumed statutory reserves of
$4,734.0 million and $3,934.2 million from Principal Life, respectively. In the states of Vermont and Delaware, the affiliated reinsurers had permitted and prescribed practices allowing
for the admissibility of certain assets backing these reserves. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, assets admitted under these practices totaled $1,809.0 million and
$1,447.0 million, respectively.

Life
and health insurance companies are subject to certain risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements as specified by the NAIC. Under those requirements, the amount of capital and surplus
maintained by a life and health insurance company is to be determined based on the various risk factors related to it. As of December 31, 2016, Principal Life met the minimum RBC requirements.

16. Segment Information

We provide financial products and services through the following segments: Retirement and Income Solutions, Principal Global Investors, Principal International and U.S. Insurance
Solutions. In addition, we have a Corporate segment. The segments are managed and reported separately because they provide different products and services, have different strategies or have different
markets and distribution channels.

During
fourth quarter 2016, we decided to move long-term care, a business we exited and fully reinsured in 1997, from the U.S. Insurance Solutions segment to the Corporate segment to
align it with the management of other exited businesses in the Corporate segment. This change has been applied retrospectively to our segment financial information but did not impact our consolidated
financial statements.

The
Retirement and Income Solutions segment provides retirement and related financial products and services primarily to businesses, their employees and other individuals.

The
Principal Global Investors segment provides asset management services to our asset accumulation business, our insurance operations, the Corporate segment and third party clients.
This segment also includes our mutual fund business.

The
Principal International segment has operations in Latin America (Brazil, Chile and Mexico) and Asia (China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, India and Southeast Asia). We
focus on locations with large middle classes,

favorable
demographics and growing long-term savings, ideally with voluntary or mandatory pension markets. We entered these locations through acquisitions, start-up operations and joint ventures.

The
U.S. Insurance Solutions segment provides specialty benefits insurance, which consists of group dental and vision insurance, individual and group disability insurance, group life
insurance and non-medical fee-for-service claims administration, and individual life insurance throughout the United States.

Our
Corporate segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate segment primarily reflect our financing
activities (including financing costs and preferred stock dividends), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and
other adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. Results of Principal Securities, Inc., our retail broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, and our
exited group medical and long-term care insurance businesses are reported in this segment.

Management
uses segment pre-tax operating earnings in evaluating performance, which is consistent with the financial results provided to and discussed with securities analysts. We
determine segment pre-tax operating earnings by adjusting U.S. GAAP income before income taxes for pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses), as adjusted, pre-tax other adjustments that
management believes are not indicative of overall operating trends and certain adjustments related to equity method investments and noncontrolling interest. Pre-tax net realized capital gains
(losses), as adjusted, are net of related changes in the amortization pattern of DAC and related actuarial balances, recognition of deferred front-end fee revenues for sales charges on retirement and
life insurance products and services, amortization of hedge accounting book value adjustments for certain discontinued hedges, net realized capital gains and losses distributed, certain adjustments
related to equity method investments, certain adjustments related to sponsored investment funds and certain market value adjustments to fee revenues. Pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses), as
adjusted, exclude periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments and exclude certain market value adjustments of embedded derivatives and realized
capital gains (losses) associated with our exited group medical insurance business. Segment operating revenues exclude net realized capital gains (losses) (except periodic settlements and accruals on
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments), including their impact on recognition of front-end fee revenues, certain market value adjustments to fee revenues, certain adjustments related to
equity method investments, certain adjustments related to sponsored investment funds and
amortization of hedge accounting book value adjustments for certain discontinued hedges; certain adjustments related to equity method investments, pre-tax other adjustments management believes are not
indicative of overall operating trends and revenue from our exited group medical insurance business. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing the consolidated
financial performance, management believes the presentation of segment pre-tax operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting pre-tax earnings attributable
to the normal, ongoing operations of the business.

The
accounting policies of the segments are consistent with the accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of: (1) pension and other
postretirement employee benefit cost allocations and (2) income tax allocations. For purposes of determining operating earnings, the segments are allocated the service component of pension and
other postretirement benefit costs. The Corporate segment reflects the non-service components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs as assumptions are established and funding decisions are
managed from a company-wide perspective. The Corporate segment functions to absorb the risk inherent in interpreting and applying tax law. For purposes of determining operating earnings, the segments
are allocated tax adjustments consistent with the positions we took on tax returns. The Corporate segment results reflect any differences between the tax returns and the estimated resolution of any
disputes.

The
following tables summarize select financial information by segment, including operating revenues for our products and services, and reconcile segment totals to those reported in the
consolidated financial statements:

As of December 31, 2016, we had the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the 2014 Directors Stock Plan, the Long-Term Performance Plan, the Amended and
Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, the Stock Incentive Plan and the Directors Stock Plan ("Stock-Based Compensation Plans"). As of May 20, 2014, no new grants
will be made under the Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2005 Directors Stock Plan. No grants have been made under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Directors Stock Plan or the
Long-Term Performance Plan since at least 2005. Under the terms of the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, grants may be nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units or other stock-based awards. The 2014 Directors Stock Plan
provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards to our nonemployee directors. To date, we have not granted any incentive
stock options, restricted stock or performance units under any plans.

We
determine expected volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using daily price observations and implied volatility from traded options on our common stock. We believe
that incorporating both historical and implied volatility into our expected volatility assumption calculation better reflects market expectations. The expected term represents the period of time that
options granted are expected to be outstanding. We determine expected term using historical exercise and employee termination data. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected term of the
option is based on the U.S. Treasury risk-free interest rate in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on historical dividend distributions compared to the closing price of our
common shares on the grant date.

As
of December 31, 2016, we had $2.9 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options. The cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average service period of approximately 1.7 years.

Cash
received from stock options exercised under these share-based payment arrangements during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $15.3 million, $52.7 million and
$56.1 million, respectively. The actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for options exercised under these share-based payment arrangements during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was
$9.0 million, $6.0 million and $8.6 million, respectively.

Performance Share Awards

We granted performance share awards to certain employees under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive
Plan. The performance share awards are treated as an equity award and are paid in shares. Whether the performance shares are earned depends upon the participant's continued employment through the
performance period (except in the case of specific types of terminations) and our performance against three-year goals set at the beginning of the performance period. Performance goals based on
various factors must be achieved for any of the performance shares to be earned. If the performance requirements are not met, the performance shares will be forfeited, no compensation cost will be
recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. These awards have no maximum contractual term. Dividend equivalents are credited on performance shares outstanding as of
the record date. These dividend equivalents are only paid on the shares released. Total performance share awards granted were 0.3 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million in 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively.

The
total intrinsic value of performance share awards vested was $18.1 million, $20.1 million and $11.4 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Performance
share awards above represent initial target awards and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the final performance objectives to be determined at the
end of the respective performance period. The actual number of shares to be awarded at the end of each performance period will range between 0% and 150% of the initial target awards.

17. Stock-Based Compensation Plans — (continued)

The
fair value of performance share awards is determined based on the closing stock price of our common shares on the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of
performance share awards granted during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $37.38, $51.33 and $44.88, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2016, we had $4.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested performance share awards granted. The cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average service period of approximately 1.5 years.

Actual
tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for performance share awards paid out under these share-based payment arrangements for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $4.8 million,
$7.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

We issue restricted stock units under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2014 Directors Stock Plan, the Amended and Restated 2010 Stock
Incentive Plan, the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, the Stock Incentive Plan, and the Directors Stock Plan. Restricted stock units are treated as an equity award and are paid in shares. These awards have
no maximum contractual term. Dividend equivalents are credited on restricted stock units outstanding as of the record date. These dividend equivalents are only paid on the shares released. Restricted
stock units granted were 1.3 million, 0.9 million and 0.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Restricted
stock units were issued to certain employees and agents pursuant to the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan and Stock Incentive Plan.
Under these plans, awards have graded or cliff vesting over a three-year service period. When service for PFG ceases (except in the case of specific types of terminations), all vesting stops and
unvested units are forfeited.

Pursuant
to the 2014 Directors Stock Plan and the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, restricted stock units are granted to each non-employee director in office immediately following each annual
meeting of stockholders and, at the discretion of the Nominating and Governance Committee, to each person who becomes a member of the Board other than on the date of the annual meeting of
stockholders. Under these plans, awards are granted on an annual basis and cliff vest after a one-year service period. When service to PFG ceases, all vesting stops and unvested units are forfeited.

The
total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested was $46.2 million, $53.6 million and $38.5 during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The
fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing stock price of our common shares on the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted
stock units granted during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $37.59, $51.35 and $45.03, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2016, we had $45.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards granted under these plans. The cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.

The
actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for restricted stock unit payouts under these share-based payment arrangements for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $16.1 million,
$18.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, participating employees have the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock on a semi-annual
basis. Employees may purchase up to $25,000 worth of company stock each year. Employees may purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the shares' fair market value as of the

or end of the purchase period, whichever is lower. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, employees purchased 0.7 million, 0.6 million and 0.5 million shares during
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

We
recognize compensation expense for the fair value of the discount granted to employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan in the period of grant. Shares of the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan are treated as an equity award. The weighted-average fair value of the discount on the stock purchased was $14.00, $7.29 and $8.94 during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
total intrinsic value of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares settled was $10.2 million, $4.1 million and $4.7 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Cash
received from shares issued under these share-based payment arrangements for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $25.5 million, $23.4 million and $22.2 million,
respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions for the settlement of the share-based payment arrangements for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $0.6 million, $0.6 million and
$1.1 million, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2016, a total of 3.4 million of new shares were available to be made issuable by us for this plan.

20. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information

Principal Life has established special purpose entities to issue secured medium-term notes. Under the program, the payment obligations of principal and interest on the notes are secured
by funding agreements issued by Principal Life. Principal Life's payment obligations on the funding agreements are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PFG. All of the outstanding stock of
Principal Life is indirectly owned by PFG and PFG is the only guarantor of the payment obligations of the funding agreements.

The
following tables set forth condensed consolidating financial information of (i) PFG, (ii) Principal Life, (iii) Principal Financial Services, Inc. ("PFS")
and all other direct and indirect subsidiaries of PFG on a combined basis and (iv) the eliminations necessary to arrive at the information for PFG on a consolidated basis as of
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

In
presenting the condensed consolidating financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to (i) PFG's interest in all direct subsidiaries of PFG,
(ii) Principal Life's interest in all direct subsidiaries of Principal Life and (iii) PFS's interest in Principal Life even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be
consolidated under U.S. GAAP. Earnings of subsidiaries are, therefore, reflected in the parent's investment and earnings. All intercompany balances and transactions, including elimination of
the parent's investment in subsidiaries, between PFG, Principal Life and PFS and all other subsidiaries have been eliminated, as shown in the column "Eliminations." These condensed consolidating
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations, cash flows or
financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities.

Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)

December 31, 2016

20. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information — (continued)

On May 7, 2014, our shelf registration statement was filed with the SEC and became effective, replacing the shelf registration that had been in effect since May 2011. Under our
current shelf registration, we have the ability to issue, in unlimited amounts, unsecured senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debt, preferred stock, common
stock, warrants, depository shares, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of PFG, trust preferred securities of three subsidiary trusts and guarantees by PFG of these trust preferred
securities. Our wholly owned subsidiary, PFS, may guarantee, fully and unconditionally or otherwise, our obligations with respect to any non-convertible securities, other than common stock, described
in the shelf registration.

The
following tables set forth condensed consolidating financial information of (i) PFG, (ii) PFS, (iii) Principal Life and all other direct and indirect
subsidiaries of PFG on a combined basis and (iv) the eliminations necessary to arrive at the information for PFG on a consolidated basis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015, and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

In
presenting the condensed consolidating financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to (i) PFG's interest in all direct subsidiaries of PFG and
(ii) PFS's interest in Principal Life and all other subsidiaries, where applicable, even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be consolidated under U.S. GAAP. Earnings
of subsidiaries are, therefore, reflected in the parent's investment and earnings. All intercompany balances and transactions, including elimination of the parent's investment in subsidiaries, between
PFG, PFS and Principal Life and all other subsidiaries have been eliminated, as shown in the column "Eliminations." These condensed consolidating financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations, cash flows or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as
independent entities.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Principal Financial Group, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Daniel J. Houston, and our Chief Financial Officer, Terrance J. Lillis, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on our evaluation, management has concluded that
Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.

Ernst &
Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, has issued
its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report is included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We had no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In order to ensure the information we must disclose in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely
basis, we have adopted disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports we file with or submit to the SEC is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our
Chief Executive Officer, Daniel J. Houston, and our Chief Financial Officer, Terrance J. Lillis, have reviewed and evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2016, and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Item 9B.    Other Information

None

Registrant." The Company has adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. The code of ethics has been posted
on our internet website, found at

. We intend to satisfy disclosure requirements regarding amendments to, or waivers from, any
provision of our code of ethics on our website.

(1)   Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Principal Financial
Group, Inc.

In
the parent company only financial statements, our investments in subsidiaries are stated as cost plus equity in undistributed earnings of subsidiaries.

During
November 2016, the parent company became the sponsor of the defined contribution plans and deferred compensation plans discussed in Item 8. "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Employee and Agent Benefits." Prior to November 2016, Principal Life Insurance Company, an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of the parent company, was the sponsor of these plans.

(2)   Dividends and Returns of Capital Received from (Contributions to) Unconsolidated Entity

The parent company received cash dividends and returns of capital totaling $1,295.3 million, $685.5 million and $917.7 million from
subsidiaries in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(3)   Supplemental Disclosures of Non-Cash Investing Activity

The parent company's assumption of the deferred income tax asset and net plan assets associated with the defined contribution plans and deferred compensation
plans previously sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company resulted in a non-cash increase in the parent company's investment in subsidiary of $74.6 million in 2016.
