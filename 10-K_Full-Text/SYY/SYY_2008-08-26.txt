Overview

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and
    divisions, is the largest North American distributor of food and
    related products primarily to the foodservice or
    “food-prepared-away-from-home” industry. We provide
    products and related services to over 400,000 customers,
    including restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities,
    lodging establishments and other foodservice customers.

Founded in 1969, SYSCO commenced operations as a public company
    in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged
    their stock for SYSCO common stock. Since our formation, we have
    grown from $115 million to over $37 billion in annual
    sales, both through internal expansion of existing operations
    and through acquisitions. Through the end of fiscal 2008, we
    have acquired 145 companies or divisions of companies.

SYSCO Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. The
    address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390
    Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas

77077-2099,

(281) 584-1390.

Operating
    Segments

SYSCO provides food and related products to the foodservice or
    “food-prepared-away-from-home” industry. Under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”
    (SFAS 131), we have aggregated our operating companies into
    a number of segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are
    reportable segments as defined in SFAS 131. Broadline
    operating companies distribute a full line of food products and
    a wide variety of non-food products to both our traditional and
    chain restaurant customers. SYGMA operating companies distribute
    a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food
    products to chain restaurant customer locations.
    “Other” financial information is attributable to our
    other segments, including our specialty produce, custom-cut meat
    and lodging industry products segments and a company that
    distributes to international customers. Specialty produce
    companies distribute fresh produce and, on a limited basis,
    other foodservice products. Specialty meat companies distribute
    custom-cut fresh steaks, other meat, seafood and poultry. Our
    lodging industry products company distributes personal care
    guest amenities, equipment, housekeeping supplies, room
    accessories and textiles to the lodging industry. Selected
    financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as
    financial information concerning geographic areas can be found
    in Note 19, Business Segment Information, in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Customers
    and Products

The foodservice industry consists of two major customer
    types — “traditional” and “chain
    restaurant.” Traditional foodservice customers include
    restaurants, hospitals, schools, hotels and industrial caterers.
    Our chain restaurant customers include regional and national
    hamburger, sandwich, pizza, chicken, steak, ethnic and other
    chain operations.

Services to our traditional foodservice and chain restaurant
    customers are supported by similar physical facilities,
    vehicles, material handling equipment and techniques, and
    administrative and operating staffs.

The products we distribute include:

•

a full line of frozen foods, such as meats, fully prepared
    entrees, fruits, vegetables and desserts;

•

a full line of canned and dry foods;

•

fresh meats;

•

dairy products;

•

beverage products;

•

imported specialties; and

•

fresh produce.

We also supply a wide variety of non-food items, including:

•

paper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups;

•

tableware such as china and silverware;

•

cookware such as pots, pans and utensils;

•

restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and

•

cleaning supplies.

Sales are less than 1% of total

Our operating companies distribute nationally-branded
    merchandise, as well as products packaged under our private
    brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been
    manufactured for SYSCO according to specifications that have
    been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our
    quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and
    processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces
    our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that
    satisfy our requirements.

We believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, close
    contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array
    of products and services to assist customers in their
    foodservice operations are of primary importance in the
    marketing and distribution of products to traditional customers.
    Our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer
    locations and have the capability of delivering special orders
    on short notice. Through our more than 14,000 sales and
    marketing representatives and support staff of SYSCO and our
    operating companies, we stay informed of the needs of our
    customers and acquaint them with new products and services. Our
    operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to
    foodservice distribution, such as providing customers with
    product usage reports and other data, menu-planning advice, food
    safety training and assistance in inventory control, as well as
    access to various third party services designed to add value to
    our customers’ businesses.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total sales
    for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2008.

Our sales to chain restaurant customers consist of a variety of
    food products. We believe that consistent product quality and
    timely and accurate service are important factors when a chain
    restaurant selects a foodservice supplier. One chain restaurant
    customer (Wendy’s International, Inc.) accounted for 5% of
    our sales for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2008. Although
    this customer represents approximately 34% of the SYGMA segment
    sales, we do not believe that the loss of this customer would
    have a material adverse effect on SYSCO as a whole.

Based upon available information, we estimate that sales by type
    of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Sources
    of Supply

We purchase from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and
    international, none of which individually accounts for more than
    10% of our purchases. These suppliers consist generally of large
    corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise,
    as well as independent regional brand and private label
    processors and packers. Generally, purchasing is carried out
    through centrally developed purchasing programs and direct
    purchasing programs established by our various operating
    companies. We continually develop relationships with our
    suppliers.

SYSCO’s Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative, Inc. (BSCC)
    administers a consolidated product procurement program designed
    to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food and
    non-food products. The program covers the purchasing and
    marketing of SYSCO Brand merchandise as well as products from a
    number of national brand suppliers, encompassing substantially
    all product lines. SYSCO’s operating companies purchase
    product from the suppliers participating in the
    cooperative’s programs and from other suppliers, although
    SYSCO Brand products are only available to the operating
    companies through the cooperative’s programs.

SYSCO’s National Supply Chain group is focused on
    increasing profitability by lowering aggregate inventory levels,
    operating costs, and future facility expansion needs at our
    broadline operating companies while providing greater value to
    our suppliers and customers.

The National Supply Chain group has three major supply chain
    initiatives. The first initiative involves the construction and
    operation of regional distribution centers which aggregate
    inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for
    certain products for all SYSCO broadline operating companies in
    the region. We currently expect to build five to seven
    redistribution centers (RDCs). The first of these centers, the
    Northeast RDC located in Front Royal, Virginia, has been
    operational since the third quarter of fiscal 2005. A second RDC
    located in Alachua, Florida became operational in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we intend to service
    additional broadline companies from our existing RDCs. The



second initiative is the national transportation management
    initiative, which provides the capability to view and manage all
    of SYSCO’s inbound freight, both to RDCs and the operating
    companies, as a network and not as individual locations. This
    allows us to better consolidate inbound freight. Fiscal 2008 was
    the first full year we operated under this initiative, and we
    will continue to refine our execution in the future. The third
    initiative is the national implementation of demand planning and
    inventory management software. This initiative is strategically
    important in that it creates the foundation to effectively
    execute new supply chain processes, including redistribution, as
    well as efficiently manage our inventory assets. In fiscal 2008,
    we continued to improve this software and implemented it at
    additional broadline companies.

Working
    Capital Practices

Our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from
    operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings.
    See the discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources under
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations at Item 7 regarding our
    liquidity, financial position and sources and uses of funds.

Credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on
    delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of the
    customers’ credit risk. We monitor the customers’
    accounts and will suspend shipments to customers if necessary.

A majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours
    of when the customers’ orders are placed. We generally
    maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand.
    The level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on
    shelf-life, supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer
    demand. We also make purchases of additional volumes of certain
    products based on supply or pricing opportunities.

We take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where
    appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from
    our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more.

Corporate
    Headquarters’ Services

Our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our
    operating companies. Members of the corporate staff possess
    experience and expertise in, among other areas, accounting and
    finance, treasury, cash management, information technology,
    employee benefits, engineering, risk management and insurance,
    sales and marketing, payroll, human resources, training and
    development, information technology and tax compliance services.
    The corporate office also makes available warehousing and
    distribution services, which provide assistance in operational
    best practices including space utilization, energy conservation,
    fleet management and work flow.

Capital
    Improvements

To maximize productivity and customer service, we continue to
    construct and modernize our distribution facilities. During
    fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately $515,963,000,
    $603,242,000 and $513,934,000 respectively, were invested in
    facility expansions, fleet additions and other capital asset
    enhancements. The lower amount spent in fiscal 2008 was
    primarily due to delays on certain projects that will shift
    significant expenditures to fiscal 2009. As a result, we
    estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 should be in
    the range of $675,000,000 to $725,000,000. During the three
    years ended June 28, 2008, capital expenditures were
    financed primarily by internally generated funds, our commercial
    paper program and bank and other borrowings. We expect to
    finance our fiscal 2009 capital expenditures from the same
    sources.

Employees

As of June 28, 2008, we had approximately
    50,000 full-time employees, approximately 17% of whom were
    represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood
    of Teamsters. Contract negotiations are handled by each
    individual operating company. Approximately 21% of our union
    employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which
    have expired or will expire during fiscal 2009. We consider our
    labor relations to be satisfactory.

Competition

SYSCO’s business environment is competitive with numerous
    companies engaged in foodservice distribution. Our customers may
    also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets.
    While competition is encountered primarily from local and
    regional distributors, a few companies compete with us on a
    national basis. We believe that the principal competitive
    factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer
    contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of quality
    products and related services on a timely and dependable basis
    and competitive prices. We estimate that we serve about 16% of
    an approximately $231 billion annual market that includes
    the foodservice market in the United States and Canada and the
    hotel amenity, furniture and textile markets in the United
    States, Canada, Europe and Asia. We believe, based upon industry
    trade data, that our sales to the United States and Canada
    “food-prepared-away-from-home” industry were the
    highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2008. While
    adequate industry statistics are not available, we believe that
    in most instances our local operations are among the leading
    distributors of food and related non-food products to
    foodservice customers in their respective trading areas. We
    believe our competitive advantages include our diversified
    product base, the diversity in the types of customers we serve,
    our economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the
    United States and Canada, which allows us to minimize the impact
    of regional economic declines. We are the only publicly-traded
    distributor in the “food-prepared-away-from-home”
    industry in the United States. While our public company status
    provides us with some advantages, including access to capital,
    we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that our
    competitors do not have in terms of additional costs related to
    complying with regulatory requirements.



Government
    Regulation

As a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject
    to a number of statutes governing the manufacture, storage,
    transport, and sale of food products in the United States and
    Canada. The principal statutes are the U.S. Federal Food,
    Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as the
    Canadian Food and Drugs Act and the regulations thereunder.

The FDA regulates manufacturing and holding requirements for
    foods through its manufacturing practice regulations, specifies
    the standards of identity for certain foods and prescribes the
    format and content of certain information required to appear on
    food product labels. For certain product lines, we are also
    subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products
    Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the
    Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated thereunder
    by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA
    imposes standards for product quality and sanitation including
    the inspection and labeling of meat and poultry products and the
    grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our
    suppliers. We are also subject to the Federal Trade Commission
    Act, which governs food advertising and the Public Health
    Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002
    and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which establish
    certain registration, import notification and record keeping
    requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or
    hold food for human or animal consumption.

In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency administers and
    enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards
    established by Health Canada under the Canadian Food and Drugs
    Act and under other related federal legislation, including the
    Canada Agricultural Products Act, the Meat Inspection Act, the
    Fish Inspection Act and the Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act
    (as it relates to food). These laws regulate the processing,
    storing, grading, packaging, marking, transporting and
    inspection of certain SYSCO product lines as well as the
    packaging, labeling, sale, importation and advertising of
    pre-packaged and certain other products.

We and our products are also subject to state, provincial and
    local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our
    facilities; enforcement by state, provincial and local health
    agencies of state, provincial and local standards for our
    products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection
    with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to
    inspections by FDA and USDA, as well as inspections and
    regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety
    and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor, together
    with similar occupational health and safety laws in each
    Canadian province. These regulations require us to comply with
    certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect
    our employees from accidents and to establish hazard
    communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of
    certain chemicals present in products we distribute.

We are also subject to regulation by numerous U.S. and
    Canadian federal, state, provincial and local regulatory
    agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Equal
    Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of
    Labor and each Canadian provincial ministry of labour, which set
    employment practice standards for workers, and the
    U.S. Department of Transportation and the Canadian
    Transportation Agency, which regulate transportation of
    perishable and hazardous materials and waste, and similar state,
    provincial and local agencies.

Most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based
    refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel
    and other petroleum products which are subject to laws
    regulating such systems and storage tanks, as well as laws
    regulating the handling and release of these substances. Our
    facilities also have large areas of impermeable surface for
    parking and staging of vehicles and therefore are potentially
    subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and
    regulations covering storm water run-off. Other U.S. and
    Canadian federal, state, provincial and local provisions
    relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge
    of materials do not materially impact the use or operation of
    our facilities.

Compliance with these laws has not had, and is not anticipated
    to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings
    or competitive position.

General

We have numerous trademarks which are of significant importance
    to the company. We believe that the loss of the

SYSCO(R)

trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations.

We are not engaged in material research and development
    activities relating to the development of new products or the
    improvement of existing products.

Our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal
    basis; therefore, the business of the company is not deemed to
    be seasonal.

As of June 28, 2008, we operated 180 distribution
    facilities throughout the United States and Canada.



Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Increased
    Fuel Costs and Increased Inflation Have Increased our Costs and
    We May Not Be Able to Compensate for Such Increased
    Costs

Increased fuel costs have had a negative impact on our fiscal
    2008 results of operations. The high cost of fuel has increased
    the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred
    by us to deliver products to our customers. Although we have
    been able to pass along a portion of our increased fuel costs to
    our customers, there is no guarantee that we can continue to do
    so. In addition, prolonged periods of product cost inflation may
    have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the
    extent that we are unable to pass on such product cost
    increases. Our estimate for the inflation in SYSCO’s cost
    of goods was 6.0% in fiscal 2008, compared to 3.4% in fiscal
    2007 and 0.6% in fiscal 2006. If fuel costs and product costs
    continue to increase, we may experience difficulties in passing
    all or a portion of these costs along to our customers, which
    may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability.

Inflation,
    Rising Fuel Costs and Other Economic Conditions are Affecting
    Consumer Confidence, which is Currently Adversely Impacting our
    Business and We Currently Expect These Conditions to Continue
    into Fiscal 2009

The foodservice distribution industry is characterized by
    relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit
    margins and the foodservice industry is sensitive to national
    and regional economic conditions. Inflation, increases in fuel
    costs and other general economic conditions have negatively
    affected consumer confidence and discretionary spending in
    fiscal 2008. This has led to reductions in the frequency of
    dining out and the amount spent by consumers for food prepared
    away from home and can also result in reduction of sales
    volumes, competitive price pressures, difficulties in collecting
    accounts receivable, increases in our product costs and
    increases in delivery costs. These conditions have, in turn,
    negatively impacted our sales, as noted by declining rate of
    sales growth from 8.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to
    5.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and have also
    negatively impacted our operating results for fiscal 2008. These
    conditions are expected to continue to negatively impact our
    results for the foreseeable future.

Conditions
    Beyond our Control can Interrupt our Supplies and Increase our
    Product Costs

We obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related
    products from third party suppliers. For the most part, we do
    not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them
    to provide products to us. Although our purchasing volume can
    provide leverage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not
    provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in
    the quantities and at the prices requested. Because we do not
    control the actual production of the products we sell, we are
    also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and
    increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our
    control. These conditions include work slowdowns, work
    interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of
    suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation
    interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel
    costs, competitive demands and natural disasters or other
    catastrophic events (including, but not limited to food-borne
    illnesses in the United States and Canada). Our inability to
    obtain adequate supplies of our foodservice and related products
    as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could
    mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers, and
    customers may turn to other distributors.

Taxing
    Authorities May Successfully Challenge our Baugh Supply Chain
    Cooperative Structure

The Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative (BSCC) administers a
    consolidated product procurement program to develop, obtain and
    ensure consistent quality food and non-food products. BSCC is a
    cooperative taxed under subchapter T of the United States
    Internal Revenue Code. We believe that the deferred tax
    liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal
    ownership of BSCC are appropriate under the tax laws. However,
    if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure
    of BSCC were to be successfully challenged by any federal, state
    or local tax authority, we could be required to accelerate the
    payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities
    associated with BSCC that we otherwise had deferred until future
    periods. In that event, we would be liable for interest on such
    amounts. As of June 28, 2008, we have recorded deferred
    income tax liabilities of $1,054,190,000 related to the BSCC
    supply chain distributions. This amount represents the income
    tax liabilities related to BSCC that were accrued, but the
    payment had been deferred as of June 28, 2008. In addition,
    if the IRS or any other taxing authority determines that all
    amounts since the inception of BSCC were inappropriately
    deferred or that BSCC should have been a taxable entity, we
    estimate that in addition to making a current payment for
    amounts previously deferred, as discussed above, we may have
    additional liability, representing interest that would be
    payable on the cumulative deferred balances ranging from
    $290,000,000 to $320,000,000, prior to federal and state income
    tax benefit, as of June 28, 2008. We calculated this amount
    based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of BSCC
    applying the applicable jurisdictions’ interest rates in
    effect each period. The IRS, in connection with its audit of our
    2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns, proposed adjustments
    related to the taxability of the cooperative structure. We are
    vigorously protesting these adjustments. We have reviewed the
    merits of the issues raised by the IRS and concluded the
    measurement model of FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” required us
    to provide an accrual for a portion of the interest exposure. If
    a taxing authority requires us to accelerate the payment of
    these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest, if
    any, we may be required to raise additional capital through debt
    financing or the issuance of equity or we may have to forego
    share repurchases or defer planned capital expenditures or a
    combination of these items.

We
    Need Access to Borrowed Funds in Order to Grow, but Our
    Leveraged Position Could Increase Our Vulnerability to
    Competitive Pressures

Because a substantial part of our growth historically has been
    the result of acquisitions and capital expansion, our continued
    growth depends, in large part, on our ability to continue this
    expansion. As a result, our inability to finance acquisitions
    and capital expenditures through borrowed funds



could restrict our ability to expand. Moreover, any default
    under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a
    significant adverse effect on our cash flows, as well as the
    market value of our common stock. Further, our leveraged
    position may also increase our vulnerability to competitive
    pressures.

Product
    Liability Claims Could Materially Impact our
    Business

We, like any other seller of food, face the risk of exposure to
    product liability claims in the event that the use of products
    sold by SYSCO causes injury or illness. With respect to product
    liability claims, we believe we have sufficient primary or
    excess umbrella liability insurance. However, this insurance may
    not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or, if
    available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities.
    We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance
    coverage from parties supplying our products, but this
    indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical
    matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and
    the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If
    SYSCO does not have adequate insurance or contractual
    indemnification available, product liability relating to
    defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and
    earnings per share.

Adverse
    Publicity Could Negatively Impact our Reputation and Reduce
    Earnings

Maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business,
    particularly to selling SYSCO Brand products. Anything that
    damages that reputation, whether or not justified, including
    adverse publicity about the quality, safety or integrity of our
    products, could quickly affect our revenues and profits.
    Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses, such as

e-coli,

avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A,
    trichinosis or salmonella, and injuries caused by food tampering
    could also severely injure our reputation. If patrons of our
    restaurant customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, our
    customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant
    locations and our sales would be correspondingly decreased. In
    addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering or
    other health concerns, even those unrelated to the use of SYSCO
    products, can result in negative publicity about the food
    service distribution industry and cause our sales to decrease
    dramatically.

Failure
    to Successfully Renegotiate Union Contracts Could Result in Work
    Stoppages

As of June 28, 2008, approximately 8,700 employees at
    54 operating companies were members of 57 different local unions
    associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and
    other labor organizations. In fiscal 2009, 14 agreements
    covering approximately 1,900 employees have expired or will
    expire. Failure of the operating companies to effectively
    renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages.
    Although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any
    significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and we
    believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions,
    a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating
    subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a
    material adverse effect on us.

A
    Shortage of Qualified Labor Could Negatively Impact our Business
    and Materially Reduce Earnings

Our operations rely heavily on our employees, particularly
    drivers, and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly
    affect our business. Our recruiting and retention efforts and
    efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and
    there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods.
    Any such shortage would decrease SYSCO’s ability to
    effectively serve our customers. Such a shortage would also
    likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding
    reduction in our net earnings.

We
    may be Required to Pay Material Amounts Under Multi-Employer
    Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We contribute to several multi-employer defined benefit pension
    plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining
    agreements covering union-represented employees. Approximately
    12% of our current employees are participants in such
    multi-employer plans. In fiscal 2008, our total contributions to
    these plans were approximately $35,040,000.

We do not directly manage these multi-employer plans, which are
    generally managed by boards of trustees, half of whom are
    appointed by the unions and the other half by other contributing
    employers to the plan. Based upon the information available to
    us from plan administrators, we believe that some of these
    multi-employer plans are underfunded due partially to a decline
    in the value of the assets supporting these plans, a reduction
    in the number of actively participating members for whom
    employer contributions are required, and the level of benefits
    provided by the plans. In addition, the Pension Protection Act,
    enacted in August 2006, requires underfunded pension plans to
    improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based
    on the level of their underfunding. As a result, our required
    contributions to these plans may increase in the future.

Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, our voluntary withdrawal, or
    the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any
    underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would require us
    to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the
    multi-employer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. Based on
    the information available from plan administrators, we estimate
    that our share of withdrawal liability on most of the
    multi-employer plans we participate in, some of which appear to
    be underfunded, could be as much as $140,000,000, of which only
    approximately $22,000,000 has been accrued as of June 28,
    2008. In addition, if a multi-employer defined benefit plan
    fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the IRS
    may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of the
    accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing
    to the fund. Requirements to pay such increased contributions,
    withdrawal liability, and excise taxes could negatively impact
    our liquidity and results of operations.



Product
    Cost Deflation May also Adversely Impact Future
    Operations

Although we are currently experiencing a period of product cost
    inflation, our business may also be adversely impacted by
    periods of prolonged product cost deflation. We make a
    significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the
    cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup. As a result,
    our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of
    product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage
    may remain relatively constant.

We
    Must Finance and Integrate Acquired Businesses
    Wisely

Historically, a portion of our growth has come through
    acquisitions. If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses
    successfully or realize anticipated economic, operational and
    other benefits and synergies in a timely manner, our earnings
    per share may decrease. Integration of an acquired business may
    be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in
    which we have limited or no expertise, or with a culture
    different from SYSCO’s. A significant expansion of our
    business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude,
    could strain our administrative and operational resources.
    Significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of
    material additional amounts of debt or equity, which could
    materially alter our debt to equity ratio, increase our interest
    expense and decrease earnings per share, and make it difficult
    for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or
    capital investments.

Expanding
    into International Markets Presents Unique Challenges, and our
    Expansion Efforts and International Operations may not be
    Successful

In addition to our domestic activities, an element of our
    strategy includes expansion of operations into new international
    markets. Our ability to successfully operate in international
    markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs,
    legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, political and economic conditions
    and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we
    currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks
    inherent in our existing and future international operations
    also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of
    managing international operations, difficulties in identifying
    and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible
    adverse tax consequences, maintaining product quality and
    greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.
    Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations
    may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows
    from our international operations.

Our
    Preferred Stock Provides Anti-Takeover Benefits that may not be
    Beneficial to Stockholders

Under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SYSCO’s
    Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to
    1,500,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder
    approval. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult
    for anyone to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of
    Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock
    issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire SYSCO without
    approval of the Board of Directors of SYSCO, the existence of
    this undesignated preferred stock could allow the Board of
    Directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining
    stockholder approval, which could result in substantial dilution
    to a potential acquirer. As a result, hostile takeover attempts
    that might result in an acquisition of SYSCO, that could
    otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders,
    could be deterred.

Technology
    Dependence Could have a Material Negative Impact on our
    Business

Our ability to decrease costs and increase profits, as well as
    our ability to serve customers most effectively, depends on the
    reliability of our technology network. We use software and other
    technology systems, among other things, to load trucks in the
    most efficient manner to optimize the use of storage space and
    minimize the time spent at each stop. Any disruption to these
    computer systems could adversely impact our customer service,
    decrease the volume of our business and result in increased
    costs. While SYSCO has invested and continues to invest in
    technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans,
    these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology
    disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations
    and profits.

We own approximately 19,318,000 square feet of our
    distribution facilities (or 81.3% of the total square feet), and
    the remainder is occupied under leases expiring at various dates
    from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2023, exclusive of renewal options.
    Certain of the facilities owned by the company are subject to
    industrial revenue bond financing arrangements totaling
    $15,473,000 as of June 28, 2008. Such industrial revenue
    bond financing arrangements mature at various dates through
    fiscal 2026.

We own our approximately 625,000 square foot headquarters
    office complex in Houston, Texas.



Facilities in Victoria, British Columbia; Chicago, Illinois;
    Portland, Oregon; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Houston, Texas
    (which in the aggregate accounted for approximately 5.3% of
    fiscal 2008 sales) are operating near capacity and we are
    currently constructing expansions or replacements for these
    distribution facilities.

As of June 28, 2008, our fleet of approximately 9,100
    delivery vehicles consisted of tractor and trailer combinations,
    vans and panel trucks, most of which are either wholly or
    partially refrigerated for the transportation of frozen or
    perishable foods. We own approximately 87% of these vehicles and
    lease the remainder.

On November 10, 2005, we announced that the Board of
    Directors approved the repurchase of 20,000,000 shares.
    Pursuant to the repurchase program, shares may be acquired in
    the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the
    company’s discretion, subject to market conditions and
    other factors.

In July 2004, the Board of Directors authorized us to enter into
    agreements from time to time to extend our ongoing repurchase
    program to include repurchases during company announced
    “blackout periods” of such securities in compliance
    with

Rule 10b5-1

promulgated under the Exchange Act.



Stock Performance
    Graph

The following performance graph and related information shall
    not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
    future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that
    the Company specifically incorporates such information by
    reference into such filing.

The following stock performance graph compares the performance
    of SYSCO’s Common Stock to the S&P 500 Index, to the
    S&P 500 Food/Staple Retail Index and to a peer group, the
    “old peer group,” for SYSCO’s last five fiscal
    years. The members of the old peer group were Nash Finch
    Company, Supervalu, Inc. and Performance Food Group Company.
    Each of these companies was chosen because it was a publicly
    held corporation with food distribution operations similar in
    some respects to our operations; however, Performance Food Group
    Company ceased to be a public company in May 2008 and Nash Finch
    is not comparable in size and scope of operations to SYSCO. As a
    result, for future comparisons, SYSCO intends to replace this
    peer group with the S&P 500 Food/Staple Retail Index, which
    is maintained by Standard & Poor’s Corporation
    and is composed of Costco Wholesale Corp., CVS Caremark
    Corporation, The Kroger Co., Safeway Inc., Supervalu, Inc.,
    SYSCO Corporation, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Walgreen Company and
    Whole Foods Market, Inc. This index was chosen to more closely
    match SYSCO’s revenue size, market capitalization and
    markets served.

The returns of each member of the old peer group are weighted
    according to each member’s stock market capitalization as
    of the beginning of each period measured. Performance Food Group
    Company ceased to be a public company during May 2008. As a
    result, we used the closing price of this company’s common
    stock on its last day as a publicly traded company as its
    June 28, 2008 per share value in the graph below. The graph
    assumes that the value of the investment in our Common Stock,
    the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 Food/Staple Index and
    the old peer group was $100 on the last trading day of fiscal
    2003, and that all dividends were reinvested. Except as provided
    above with respect to Performance Food Group, performance data
    for SYSCO, the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 Food/Staple
    Retail Index and for the old peer group is provided as of the
    last trading day of each of our last five fiscal years.

    result, the results of operations for fiscal 2006 and later
    years include incremental share-based compensation cost over
    what would have been recorded had we continued to account for
    share-based compensation under APB No. 25, “Accounting

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Highlights

Sales increased 7.1% in fiscal 2008 over the prior year. Product
    costs increased an estimated 6.0% during fiscal 2008 over the
    prior year. Operating income increased to $1,879,949,000 and
    5.0% of sales, a 10.0% increase over the prior year. Net
    earnings and diluted earnings per share increased 10.5% and
    13.1%, respectively, over the prior year.

Fiscal 2008 provided a challenging economic environment. Our
    industry is experiencing various macro-economic pressures,
    including high fuel costs, rising food prices and general
    economic conditions which are pressuring consumer disposable
    income. These factors restricted growth in fiscal 2008 and are
    continuing into fiscal 2009. High food cost inflation, which we
    began to experience in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007,
    prevailed throughout fiscal 2008. In spite of these conditions,
    our operating companies managed margins and expenses
    effectively. Gross profit dollars increased 6.5% in fiscal 2008,
    while operating expenses grew only 5.3% over the prior year.

Operating income was negatively impacted by additional expenses
    from the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the
    carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to
    their cash surrender values as compared to gains in fiscal 2007
    and increased provisions related to multi-employer pension
    plans. The negative impact of these additional expenses was
    partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and
    lower company-sponsored pension expenses. In addition, fuel
    costs increased in fiscal 2008, driven by higher fuel prices. We
    partially offset the impact of the higher fuel costs through
    fuel usage reduction measures as well as fuel surcharges. We
    expect fuel costs in fiscal 2009 to be greater than in fiscal
    2008.

Overview

SYSCO distributes food and related products to restaurants,
    healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments
    and other foodservice customers. Our operations are located
    throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline
    companies, specialty produce companies, custom-cut meat
    operations, hotel supply operations, SYGMA (our chain restaurant
    distribution subsidiary) and a company that distributes to
    international customers.

We estimate that we serve about 16% of an approximately
    $231 billion annual market. This market includes
    i) the foodservice market in the United States and Canada
    and ii) the hotel amenity and hotel furniture and textile
    market in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. According
    to industry sources, the foodservice, or
    food-prepared-away-from-home, market represents approximately
    one-half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at
    the consumer level. This share grew from about 37% in 1972 to
    about 50% in 1998 and has not changed materially since that time.

Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market
    experienced real sales growth of approximately 1.3% in calendar
    year 2007 and 1.9% in calendar year 2006.

General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect
    the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for
    food-prepared-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our
    customers and our sales. We believe the current general economic
    conditions, including pressure on consumer disposable income,
    are contributing to a decline in the foodservice market.
    Historically, we have grown at a faster rate than the overall
    industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented
    industry. We intend to continue our efforts to expand our market
    share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth, margin
    management, productivity gains and supply chain management.

Strategic
    Business Initiatives

SYSCO maintains strategic focus areas which aim to help us
    achieve our long-term vision of becoming the global leader of
    the efficient, multi-temperature food product value chain. The
    following areas generally comprise the initiatives that are
    currently serving as the foundation of our efforts to ensure a
    sustainable future.

•

Sourcing and National Supply Chain

focuses on lowering
    our cost of goods sold by leveraging SYSCO’s purchasing
    power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an
    end-to-end view of our supply chain. Our National Supply Chain
    initiative is focused on lowering inventory, inbound freight,
    product costs, operating costs, working capital requirements and
    future facility expansion needs at our operating companies while
    providing greater value to our suppliers and customers.

•

Integrated Delivery

focuses on standardized processes to
    optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the
    corporation and manage energy consumption to achieve a more
    efficient delivery of products to our customers.

•

Demand

explores and implements practices to better
    understand and more profitably sell to and service SYSCO’s
    customers, including better tools and processes for selling.

•

Organizational Capabilities

works to align management
    reporting, information technology systems and performance
    measures with the business initiatives.

A major component of our National Supply Chain is the use of
    redistribution centers (RDCs). The first RDC, the Northeast RDC
    located in Front Royal, Virginia, opened during the third
    quarter of fiscal 2005. Construction of our second RDC in
    Alachua, Florida was completed in fiscal 2008, and



operations to service our five broadline operating companies in
    Florida began in April 2008. In fiscal 2009, we intend to
    service additional broadline companies from our existing RDCs.

We will continue to use our strategic business initiatives to
    leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve
    how we buy, handle and market products for our customers. Our
    primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice
    distribution business in North America, however we will also
    continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our
    global capabilities and stay abreast of international
    acquisition opportunities.

As a part of our on going strategic analysis, we regularly
    evaluate business opportunities, including potential
    acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses.

Accounting
    Changes

FIN 48
    Adoption

As of July 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting
    for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the application of
    SFAS 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax
    position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position
    to be recognized in the financial statements. Additionally,
    FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition,
    classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with
    accounting for the related interest and penalties. As a result
    of this adoption, we recognized, as a cumulative effect of
    change in accounting principle, a $91,635,000 decrease in our
    beginning retained earnings on our July 1, 2007 balance
    sheet.

Pension
    Measurement Date Change and SFAS 158
    Adoption

As of June 30, 2007, we adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”
    (SFAS 158). The recognition provision requires an employer
    to recognize a plan’s funded status in its statement of
    financial position and recognize the changes in a postretirement
    benefit plan’s funded status in comprehensive income in the
    year in which the changes occur. The effect of adoption on our
    consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2007 was a
    decrease in prepaid pension cost of $83,846,000, a decrease in
    other assets of $43,854,000, an increase in accrued expenses of
    $10,967,000, a decrease in long-term deferred taxes of
    $73,328,000, an increase in other long-term liabilities of
    $52,289,000, and a charge to accumulated other comprehensive
    loss of $117,628,000. The adoption of SFAS 158’s
    recognition provision did not have an effect on our consolidated
    balance sheet as of July 1, 2006. The adoption has no
    effect on our consolidated results of operations for any period
    presented, and it will not affect our consolidated results of
    operations in future periods.

SFAS 158 also has a measurement date provision, which is a
    requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of
    the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of
    financial position, effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2008. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we
    changed the measurement date for company-sponsored pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal year-end to
    May 31st to assist us in meeting accelerated SEC
    filing dates. As a result of this change, we recorded a
    cumulative effect of a change in accounting, which increased net
    earnings for fiscal 2006 by $9,285,000, net of tax. With the
    issuance of SFAS 158, we have elected to early adopt the
    measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of
    this accounting standard at the same time. As a result,
    beginning with fiscal 2008, the measurement date again
    corresponded with our fiscal year-end. We performed measurements
    as of May 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 of our plan
    assets and benefit obligations. We recorded a charge to
    beginning retained earnings on July 1, 2007 of $3,572,000,
    net of tax, for the impact of the cumulative difference in our
    pension expense between the two measurement dates. We also
    recorded a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) on July 1, 2007 of $22,780,000, net of tax,
    for the impact of the difference in our balance sheet
    recognition provision between the two measurement dates.

EITF

04-13

Adoption

In the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we
    adopted accounting pronouncement

EITF 04-13

“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the
    Same Counterparty,”

(EITF 04-13).

The accounting standard requires certain transactions, where
    inventory is purchased by us from a customer and then resold at
    a later date to the same customer (as defined), to be presented
    in the income statement on a net basis. This situation primarily
    arises for SYSCO when a customer has a proprietary item which
    they have either manufactured or sourced, but they require our
    distribution and logistics capabilities to get the product to
    their locations. The application of this standard requires sales
    and cost of sales to be reduced by the same amount for these
    transactions and thus net earnings are unaffected by the
    application of this standard. We adopted this accounting
    pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and
    have applied it to similar transactions prospectively. Prior
    period sales and cost of sales have not been restated.
    Therefore, the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of
    gross margins, operating expenses and earnings as a percentage
    of sales between the non-comparable periods is affected. The
    impact of adopting this standard resulted in sales being reduced
    by $99,803,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, and
    $253,724,000 for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2007, without
    a reduction in sales for the comparable prior year periods.
    Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, sales are
    reported on a comparable accounting basis with the comparable
    prior year period.



SFAS 123(R)
    Adoption

In fiscal 2006, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,”
    (SFAS 123(R)) utilizing the modified-prospective transition
    method under which prior period results have not been restated.
    Our consolidated results of operations for all periods presented
    include share-based compensation cost recorded in accordance
    with SFAS 123(R).

Sales

Sales for fiscal 2008 were 7.1% greater than fiscal 2007.
    Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.1% to the overall
    sales growth rate for fiscal 2008.

Sales for fiscal 2007 were 7.4% greater than fiscal 2006.
    Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.7% to the overall
    sales growth rate for fiscal 2007. The impact of

EITF 04-13

reduced sales growth by 0.7%, or $334,002,000 for fiscal 2007,
    compared to a $99,803,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are
    reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007, which is the one-year anniversary of the
    adoption of

EITF 04-13.

Product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling
    prices was a significant contributor to sales growth in fiscal
    2008 and to a lesser extent in fiscal 2007. Estimated product
    cost increases, an internal measure of inflation, were
    approximately 6.0% during fiscal 2008, as compared to 3.4%
    during fiscal 2007.

The rate of sales growth declined throughout fiscal 2008 from
    8.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to 5.4% in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008. We believe the current general economic
    conditions, which are placing pressure on consumer disposable
    income, are contributing to a decline in real volume growth in
    the foodservice market and in turn, have contributed to a
    slow-down in our sales growth. To the extent that these
    conditions persist, we believe that sales growth in fiscal 2009
    will be lower than what was achieved in fiscal 2008.

We believe that our continued focus on the use of business
    reviews and business development activities, investment in
    customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing
    associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to
    strengthen customer relationships and growing sales with new and
    existing customers.

Operating
    Income

Cost of sales primarily includes product costs, net of vendor
    consideration, as well as in-bound freight. Operating expenses
    include the costs of facilities, product handling, delivery,
    selling and general and administrative activities.

Operating income increased 10.0% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal
    2007, increasing to 5.0% of sales. Gross margin dollars
    increased 6.5% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, and
    operating expenses increased 5.3% in fiscal 2008. Operating
    income increased 14.3% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006,
    increasing to 4.9% of sales. Gross margin dollars increased 7.4%
    in fiscal 2007, and operating expenses increased 5.3% in fiscal
    2007.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, SYSCO began
    experiencing product cost increases in numerous product
    categories. These increases have persisted throughout fiscal
    2008 at levels approximating 6.0%. Generally, SYSCO attempts to
    pass increased costs to its customers; however, because of
    contractual and competitive reasons, we are not able to pass
    along all of the product cost increases immediately.
    SYSCO’s goal is to obtain the lowest total procurement cost
    for our customers. We believe that we have managed the
    inflationary environment well, as evidenced by gross margin
    dollars increasing in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 at rates greater
    than expense increases. The high rate of product cost inflation
    has continued into fiscal 2009. We believe that prolonged
    periods of high inflation, such as the current rate, have a
    negative impact on our customers as rising food costs and fuel
    costs can reduce consumer spending in the
    food-prepared-away-from home market. As a result, these factors
    may negatively impact our sales, gross margins and earnings.

Fiscal 2008 operating expenses were negatively impacted by a net
    $24,135,000 in additional expenses as compared to fiscal 2007
    from the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the
    carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to
    their cash surrender values and increased provisions related to
    multi-employer pension plans, partially offset by lower
    share-based compensation expense and lower company-sponsored
    pension expenses. In addition, fuel costs increased during
    fiscal 2008. We increased our use of fuel surcharges to offset a
    portion of these increased costs, thereby partially reducing the
    impact to operating income.

In fiscal 2007, the positive impact on operating expenses from
    decreases in company-sponsored pension expenses, share-based
    compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash
    surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, was
    largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals
    and investments in strategic business initiatives.

The carrying value of our corporate-owned life insurance
    policies is adjusted to their cash surrender values. This
    resulted in a loss of $8,718,000 in fiscal 2008, a gain of
    $23,922,000 in fiscal 2007 and a gain of $9,702,000 in fiscal
    2006.

In fiscal 2008, we recorded a provision of $22,284,000 related
    to additional amounts that we expect to be required to
    contribute to an underfunded multi-employer pension plan and our
    withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan. In fiscal 2007,
    we recorded a provision of $4,700,000 related to our withdrawal
    from a multi-employer pension plan. See additional discussion of
    multi-employer pension plans at “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources, Other Considerations.”

Share-based compensation cost in fiscal 2008 was $17,335,000
    less than fiscal 2007. Share-based compensation expense
    decreased $28,852,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. These
    decreases were primarily due to lower levels of stock option
    grants in recent years as compared to previous years.

Net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2008 were
    $8,754,000 less than fiscal 2007, due primarily to the funding
    status and the projected asset performance of the qualified
    pension plan. Net company-sponsored pension costs decreased
    $56,001,000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year, due primarily to
    the increase in the discount rate used to determine fiscal 2007
    pension costs.



Also affecting the comparison of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006
    were increased management incentive bonus accruals and
    investments in strategic business initiatives. Due primarily to
    improved operating results, the non-stock portion of management
    incentive bonus accruals increased $64,770,000 in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006 when our performance did not satisfy the
    criteria for paying bonuses to our corporate officers.
    Investments in strategic business initiatives increased
    $22,410,000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year.

In addition, SYSCO’s fuel costs increased by $34,023,000 in
    fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased diesel
    prices. Our fuel costs increased by $21,225,000 in fiscal 2007
    over fiscal 2006 due to increased diesel prices and increased
    volume usage. SYSCO’s costs per gallon have increased 18.7%
    in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and 7.1% in fiscal 2007 over
    fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, fuel costs,
    excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges,
    represented approximately 0.6%, 0.6% and 0.5% of sales,
    respectively. SYSCO’s activities to manage increased fuel
    costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through
    improved routing techniques, improving fleet utilization by
    adjusting idling time and maximum speeds, entering into forward
    fuel purchase commitments and the use of fuel surcharges.

We periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a
    portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. In
    fiscal 2008, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an
    estimated $21,000,000 of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price
    contracts were lower than market prices for the contracted
    volumes. In fiscal 2007, the forward purchase commitments
    resulted in prices that were comparable to market prices. In
    fiscal 2006, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an
    estimated $9,000,000 of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price
    contracts were lower than market prices for the contracted
    volumes. In July and August 2008, we entered into forward diesel
    fuel purchase commitments totaling approximately $195,000,000
    through July 2009, which will lock in the price on approximately
    50% of our fuel purchases through the first 26 weeks of
    fiscal 2009 and approximately 70% of our fuel purchases needs
    for the last 26 weeks of fiscal 2009.

In fiscal 2008, due to sustained, increased diesel prices, SYSCO
    increased its use of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges were
    approximately $27,000,000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal
    2007. The change in fuel surcharges in fiscal 2007 over fiscal
    2006 was not significant. Fuel surcharges are reflected within
    sales and gross margins.

If fuel prices continue at current levels, fuel costs in the
    first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009, exclusive of any amounts
    recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to increase by
    approximately $55,000,000 to $65,000,000 as compared to the
    first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008. Our estimate is based upon
    the prevailing market prices for diesel in mid-August 2008, the
    cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements
    currently in place and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual
    fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these
    assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary
    significantly from our current estimates. We continue to
    evaluate all opportunities to offset this increase in fuel
    expense in fiscal 2009, including the continued use of fuel
    surcharges and overall expense management. If fuel surcharges
    continue in fiscal 2009 at the same levels as the end of fiscal
    2008, we estimate that we can recover about half of the
    anticipated increase in fuel costs noted above through increased
    fuel surcharges, which is less than the approximate 75% we were
    able to recover in fiscal 2008.

Customer accounts written off, net of recoveries, were
    $32,367,000, or 0.09% of sales, $26,010,000 or 0.07% of sales,
    and $21,128,000 or 0.06% of sales, for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. We continue to monitor our customer account
    balances and believe continued strong credit practices will be
    necessary to avoid significant increases in write-offs in fiscal
    2009. However, if the challenging economic environment persists,
    we could experience increased levels of write-offs and a higher
    provision for losses on receivables in fiscal 2009.

Net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 are expected
    to increase by approximately $20,000,000 due primarily to lower
    returns on assets of the qualified pension plan during fiscal
    2008, partially offset by a decrease in expense due to
    amendments to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
    Share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2009 is expected to
    decrease $20,000,000 to $25,000,000. The expected decrease is
    due primarily to two factors. First, option grants in prior
    years were at greater levels than recent years, resulting in
    reduced compensation expense being recognized. Secondly, the
    Management Incentive Plan annual bonus awards have been modified
    beginning with fiscal 2009, to exclude the previous stock award
    component. As a result, the share-based compensation expense
    related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses
    recorded in previous years will not be incurred in fiscal 2009,
    and as a result fiscal 2009 will reflect reduced overall
    share-based based compensation expenses. Beginning in fiscal
    2010, we expect to replace the stock award component of the
    incentive bonuses with annual discretionary restricted stock
    grants subject to time-based vesting which may result in
    increased share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2010.

Net
    Earnings

Net earnings increased 10.5% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007.
    Net earnings increased 17.0% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006.
    The changes in net earnings for these periods were due primarily
    to the factors discussed above, as well as the impact of changes
    in interest expense, other income and income taxes discussed
    below. Additionally, fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was impacted
    by a fiscal 2006 accounting change. In the first quarter of
    fiscal 2006, SYSCO recorded a cumulative effect of a change in
    accounting due to a change in the measurement date for
    company-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits
    plans, which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by
    $9,285,000, net of tax.

The increase in interest expense of $6,539,000 in fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased borrowing
    levels partially offset by lower interest rates on our floating
    rate debt. The decrease in interest expense of $4,098,000 in
    fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to decreased
    borrowing levels.

Other income, net increased $5,195,000 in fiscal 2008 over
    fiscal 2007 and $8,719,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006.
    Changes between the years resulted from fluctuations in
    miscellaneous activities, primarily gains and losses on the sale
    of surplus facilities. The increase in fiscal 2008 over fiscal
    2007 was primarily due to gains from the sale of land and
    facilities as well as the sale of a minority interest in a
    business. The increase in fiscal 2007 over the prior year is
    primarily due to a gain on the sale of land.



The effective tax rate was 38.25% in fiscal 2008, 38.25% in
    fiscal 2007 and 39.35% in fiscal 2006.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by
    tax benefits of approximately $7,700,000 resulting from the
    recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which
    arose due to a state tax law change, $8,600,000 related to the
    reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on Canadian
    net operating loss deferred tax assets and $5,500,000 related to
    the reduction in net Canadian deferred tax liabilities due
    to a federal tax rate reduction. The effective tax rate for
    fiscal 2008 was negatively impacted by the recording of tax and
    interest related to uncertain tax positions, share-based
    compensation expense and the recognition of losses to adjust the
    carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to
    their cash surrender values.

The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 over
    fiscal 2006 was primarily due to lower share-based compensation
    expense in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and increased
    gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of
    corporate-owned life insurance policies.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share
    increased 13.0% and 13.1%, respectively, in fiscal 2008 over the
    prior year. Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per
    share increased 17.4% and 17.6%, respectively, in fiscal 2007
    over the prior year. These increases were primarily the result
    of factors discussed above, as well as a net reduction in shares
    outstanding. The net reduction in average shares outstanding was
    primarily due to share repurchases. The net reduction in diluted
    shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and,
    with regard to fiscal 2008, an increase in the number of
    anti-dilutive options excluded from the diluted shares
    calculation.

Segment
    Results

We have aggregated our operating companies into a number of
    segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable
    segments as defined in SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
    about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”
    (SFAS No. 131) The accounting policies for the
    segments are the same as those disclosed by SYSCO within the
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data within Part II
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and
    meat company products distributed by the Broadline and SYGMA
    operating companies. The segment results include certain
    centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to
    our segments. These centrally incurred costs are charged based
    upon the relative level of service used by each operating
    company consistent with how management views the performance of
    its operating segments.

Prior to fiscal 2008, SYSCO’s management evaluated
    performance of each of our operating segments based on its
    respective earnings before income taxes. This measure included
    an allocation of certain corporate expenses to each operating
    segment in addition to the centrally incurred costs for shared
    services that were charged to our segments. During fiscal 2008,
    SYSCO’s management increased its focus on the performance
    of each of our operating segments based on its respective
    operating income results which excludes the allocation of
    additional corporate expenses. As a result, the segment
    reporting for fiscal 2007 and 2006 has been revised to conform
    to the fiscal 2008 presentation. While a segment’s
    operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases
    or decreases in margins, expenses, or a combination thereof,
    each business segment is expected to increase its operating
    income at a greater rate than sales growth. This is consistent
    with our long-term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a
    greater rate than sales growth.

The following table sets forth the operating income of each of
    our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a
    percentage of each segments’ sales for each period reported
    and should be read in conjunction with Business Segment
    Information in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial

Broadline
    Segment

Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food
    products and a wide variety of non-food products to both
    traditional and chain restaurant customers. Broadline operations
    have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of
    SYSCO’s operations. In fiscal 2008, the Broadline operating
    results represent approximately 80% of SYSCO’s overall
    sales and greater than 100% of SYSCO’s overall operating
    income prior to corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments.

There are several factors which contribute to these higher
    operating results as compared to the SYGMA and Other operating
    segments. We have invested substantial amounts in assets,
    operating methods, technology and management expertise in this
    segment. The breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its
    distribution area and purchasing power allow us to leverage this
    segment’s earnings.

Sales

Sales for fiscal 2008 were 8.1% greater than fiscal 2007.
    Non-comparable acquisitions did not have a material impact on
    the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008
    growth was realized both from increased sales to

multi-unit

customers and marketing associate-served customers primarily
    through continued focus on customer account penetration through
    the use of business reviews with customers and efforts of our
    marketing associates. Product cost inflation and the resulting
    increases in selling prices was the primary contributor to sales
    growth.

Sales for fiscal 2007 were 7.0% greater than fiscal 2006. The
    impact of

EITF 04-13

reduced sales growth by 0.4%, or $173,171,000, for fiscal 2007
    compared to a $57,211,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are
    reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007, which is the one-year anniversary of the
    adoption of

EITF 04-13.

Non-comparable acquisitions did not have an impact on the
    overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 growth
    was primarily due to increased sales to marketing
    associate-served customers and

multi-unit

customers primarily through continued focus on customer account
    penetration through the use of business reviews with customers,
    increases in the number of customer contact personnel and
    efforts of our marketing associates.

Operating
    Income

The increases in operating income in fiscal 2008 over fiscal
    2007 were primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a
    faster pace than expenses. We were able to manage our business
    effectively in the current inflationary environment by managing
    margins and improving operating efficiencies. Gross margin
    dollars increased 7.0% while operating expenses increased 6.1%
    in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. The high cost of fuel also
    impacted our results. Fuel costs in fiscal 2008 were $21,575,000
    higher than fiscal 2007. We attempt to mitigate increased fuel
    costs by reducing miles driven, improving fleet consumption by
    adjusting idling time and maximum speeds, entering into fixed
    price fuel purchase commitments and the use of fuel surcharges.
    In fiscal 2008, due to sustained increased diesel prices, our
    use of fuel surcharges increased. Fuel surcharges were
    approximately $21,000,000 higher in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007.

In fiscal 2008, we recorded a provision of $22,284,000 related
    to additional amounts that we expect to be required to
    contribute to an underfunded multi-employer pension plan and our
    withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan. In fiscal 2007,
    we recorded a provision of $4,700,000 related to our withdrawal
    from a multi-employer pension plan.

The increases in operating income in fiscal 2007 over fiscal
    2006 were primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a
    faster pace than expenses. Gross margin dollars increased 6.6%
    while operating expenses increased 5.4% in fiscal 2007 over
    fiscal 2006.



SYGMA
    Segment

SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food
    products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain
    chain restaurant customer locations. SYGMA operations have
    traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of
    sales than SYSCO’s other segments. This segment of the
    foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower
    overall operating margins as the volume that these customers
    command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins. These
    operations service chain restaurants through contractual
    agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case
    delivered basis.

Sales

Sales for fiscal 2008 were 4.4% greater than fiscal 2007.
    Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.3% to the overall
    sales growth rate for fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 growth was
    generally due to product cost increases and sales to new
    customers. These increases were partially offset by lost sales
    due to non-renewed customer agreements and lower case volumes
    due to difficult economic conditions impacting SYGMA’s
    customer base.

Sales for fiscal 2007 were 6.0% greater than fiscal 2006. The
    impact of

EITF 04-13

reduced sales growth by 2.7%, or $159,236,000, for fiscal 2007
    compared to a $42,560,000 reduction for fiscal 2006. Sales are
    reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007, which is the one-year anniversary of the
    adoption of

EITF 04-13.

Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 2.1% to the overall
    sales growth rate for fiscal 2007. The remaining fiscal 2007
    growth was due to sales to new customers and sales growth in
    SYGMA’s existing customer base related to increased sales
    at existing locations as well as new locations added by those
    customers. In addition, certain customers were transferred from
    Broadline operations to be serviced by SYGMA operations,
    contributing to the sales increase.

Operating
    Income

Operating income in fiscal 2008 decreased as compared to fiscal
    2007. In fiscal 2008, SYGMA expensed $5,587,000 related to the
    write-off of software development costs . In addition, some of
    SYGMA’s customers have experienced a slowdown in their
    business resulting in lower cases per delivery and therefore
    reduced gross margin dollars per stop. SYGMA also experienced
    increased fuel costs of $8,888,000 although it was able to
    partially offset these costs through increases in the fees
    charged to customers including fuel surcharges and reducing
    expenses. Fuel surcharges were approximately $6,000,000 higher
    in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Expense reductions were
    accomplished by consolidating regional offices, reducing
    headcounts and not renewing unprofitable customer contracts.

The increase in operating income in fiscal 2007 was due to
    several factors, including sales growth, increased margins and
    improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by costs of
    labor increases and auto liability related expenses. In
    addition, the transfer of customers from Broadline operations
    referred to above also contributed to the increase in operating
    income.

Other
    Segment

“Other” financial information is attributable to our
    other operating segments, including our specialty produce,
    custom-cut meat and lodging industry products and a company that
    distributes to international customers. These operating segments
    are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent
    reportable segments under SFAS No. 131.

On an aggregate basis, our “Other” segments have a
    lower operating income as a percentage of sales than
    SYSCO’s Broadline segment. SYSCO has acquired the operating
    companies within these segments in relatively recent years.
    These operations generally operate in a niche within the
    foodservice industry. These operations are also generally
    smaller in sales and scope than an average Broadline operation
    and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and
    overall scope than the Broadline segment. In the aggregate, the
    “Other” segment represented approximately 9.7% and
    7.3% of SYSCO’s overall sales and operating income in
    fiscal 2008, respectively.

Operating income increased 3.3% for fiscal 2008 over fiscal
    2007. The increase in operating income was generated primarily
    by improved results in the specialty produce and the lodging
    industry segments offset by reduced sales and operating income
    in the custom-cut meat segment.

Operating income increased 6.2% for fiscal 2007 over fiscal
    2006. The increase in operating income was generated by improved
    results in each of the other segments and acquisitions.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to
    foodservice customers primarily throughout the United States and
    Canada. We intend to continue to expand our market share through
    profitable sales growth, foldouts and acquisitions. We also
    strive to increase the effectiveness of our operations through
    the use of technology and our supply chain and other strategic
    initiatives. These objectives require continuing investment. Our
    resources include cash provided by operations and access to
    capital from financial markets.

Our operations historically have produced significant cash flow.
    Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working
    capital requirements; investments in facilities, systems, fleet
    and other equipment; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible
    with our overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated
    from operations may be applied toward a portion of the cost of
    the share repurchase program, while the remainder of the cost
    may be financed with additional debt. Our share repurchase
    program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various
    employee benefit and compensation plans, to reduce shares
    outstanding (which may have the net effect of increasing
    earnings per share) and to aid in managing the ratio of
    long-term debt to total capitalization. Historically, our
    long-term debt to total capitalization ratio has generally been
    in the



range of 35% and 40%. This ratio was 36.8% and 35.0% as of
    June 28, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively. For
    purposes of calculating this ratio, long-term debt includes both
    the current maturities and long-term portion. We continue to
    assess and review the most appropriate capital structure as well
    as the appropriate leverage ratios with which to measure that
    capital structure. As a part of our on-going strategic analysis,
    we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including
    potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses, and
    our overall capital structure. These transactions may materially
    impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage ratios and
    capital availability.

We believe that our cash flows from operations, the availability
    of additional capital under our existing commercial paper
    programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access
    capital from financial markets in the future, including
    issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration
    statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (SEC), will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash
    requirements over at least the next twelve months, while
    maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes.

Operating
    Activities

We generated $1,596,129,000 in cash flow from operations in
    fiscal 2008, $1,402,922,000 in fiscal 2007 and $1,124,679,000 in
    fiscal 2006. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008, fiscal
    2007 and fiscal 2006 was primarily due to net income in these
    years, reduced by increases in inventory balances and increases
    in accounts receivable balances, partially offset by an increase
    in accounts payable balances. The increases in accounts
    receivable and inventory balances were primarily due to sales
    growth. The accounts payable balances did not increase at the
    same rate as inventory increases. Accounts payable balances are
    impacted by many factors, including changes in product mix, cash
    discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors.

Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by a decrease
    in accrued expenses of $22,721,000 during fiscal 2008, and was
    positively impacted by increases in accrued expenses of
    $132,936,000 during fiscal 2007 and $29,161,000 during fiscal
    2006. The decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2008 was
    primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which
    is further explained below. This decrease was partially offset
    by increased accrued interest due to fixed-rate debt issued in
    fiscal 2008 and an increase to a provision related to a
    multi-employer pension plan. See additional discussion of
    multi-employer pension plans at “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources, Other Considerations.” The increase in accrued
    expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased
    accruals for fiscal 2007 incentive bonuses due to improved
    operating results over fiscal 2006. The increase in accrued
    expenses during fiscal 2006 was related to various miscellaneous
    accruals.

In fiscal 2007, we recorded a liability for a product liability
    claim of $50,296,000 and the corresponding insurance receivable
    of $48,296,000, included within prepaid expenses and other
    current assets. In fiscal 2008, these amounts were reversed as
    our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of
    the judgment in excess of our deductible. See further discussion
    of the product liability claim under Note 18, Commitments
    and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8.

Other long-term liabilities and prepaid pension cost, net,
    increased $13,459,000 during fiscal 2008, decreased $14,817,000
    in fiscal 2007 and increased $75,382,000 in fiscal 2006. The
    increase in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to an
    increase in deferred compensation from incentive compensation
    deferrals of prior-year annual incentive bonuses and the accrual
    of interest on our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
    These increases were partially offset by the recording of net
    company-sponsored pension costs and the timing of pension
    contributions to our company-sponsored plans. In fiscal 2007 and
    2006, the change in these accounts was primarily attributable to
    the recording of net company-sponsored pension costs and the
    timing and amount of pension contributions to our
    company-sponsored plans. In fiscal 2007, our pension
    contributions exceeded the amount of net pension costs
    recognized during the year resulting in a net cash outflow. In
    fiscal 2006, the net pension costs recorded exceeded the amount
    of pension contributions during the year resulting in a net cash
    inflow. We recorded net company-sponsored pension costs of
    $65,837,000, $74,591,000 and $130,592,000 during fiscal 2008,
    fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Our contributions to
    our company-sponsored defined benefit plans were $92,670,000,
    $91,163,000 and $73,764,000 during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately
    $97,000,000 to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans in
    fiscal 2009.

Investing
    Activities

Fiscal 2008 capital expenditures included:

•

construction of fold-out facilities in Knoxville, Tennessee and
    Longview, Texas;

•

replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Atlanta,
    Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Peterborough, Ontario and Houston,
    Texas;

•

completion of the Southeast RDC in Alachua, Florida; and

•

completion of work on the corporate headquarters expansion.

Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included:

•

construction of a fold-out facility in Raleigh, North Carolina;

•

replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Edmonton,
    Alberta; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Albuquerque,
    New Mexico and Columbia, South Carolina;

•

the Southeast RDC in Alachua, Florida; and

•

continuing work on the corporate headquarters expansion.

Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included:

•

construction of fold-out facilities in Geneva, Alabama;
    Springfield, Illinois and Raleigh, North Carolina;

•

replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Miami,
    Florida and Denver, Colorado; and

•

continuing work on the corporate headquarters expansion.



The lower amount spent in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to
    delays on certain projects that will shift significant
    expenditures to fiscal 2009. As a result, we expect total
    capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 to be in the range of
    $675,000,000 to $725,000,000. Fiscal 2009 expenditures will
    include the continuation of the fold-out program; facility,
    fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; the
    company’s National Supply Chain initiative; and investments
    in technology.

Financing
    Activities

Equity

We routinely engage in Board-approved share repurchase programs.
    The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past
    three fiscal years were 16,769,900 shares for $529,179,000
    in fiscal 2008, 16,231,200 shares for $550,865,000 in
    fiscal 2007 and 16,479,800 shares for $544,131,000 in
    fiscal 2006. An additional 125,000 shares have been
    purchased at a cost of $3,933,000 through August 13, 2008,
    resulting in a remaining authorization by our Board of Directors
    to repurchase up to 6,212,800 shares, based on the trades
    made through that date.

Dividends paid were $497,467,000, or $0.82 per share, in fiscal
    2008, $445,416,000, or $0.72 per share, in fiscal 2007 and
    $397,537,000, or $0.64 per share, in fiscal 2006. In May 2008,
    we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter
    of fiscal 2009 of $0.22 per share, which was paid in July 2008.

In November 2000, we filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission a shelf registration statement covering
    30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time
    to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 13,
    2008, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance
    under this registration statement.

Short-term
    Borrowings

We have uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for
    unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $145,000,000,
    of which none was outstanding as of June 28, 2008 or
    August 13, 2008.

Commercial
    Paper

We have a commercial paper program allowing us to issue
    short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed
    $1,300,000,000. The current program was entered into in April
    2006 and replaced notes that were issued under our previous
    commercial paper program as they matured and became due and
    payable.

SYSCO and one of our subsidiaries, SYSCO International, Co., has
    a revolving credit facility supporting our U.S. and
    Canadian commercial paper programs. The facility, in the amount
    of $1,000,000,000, terminates on November 4, 2012, subject
    to extension.

This facility was originally entered into in November 2005 in
    the amount of $500,000,000 and was increased to $750,000,000 in
    March 2006. In September 2006, the termination date on the
    facility was extended to November 4, 2011, in accordance
    with the terms of the agreement. In September 2007, the amount
    of the facility was increased to $1,000,000,000 and the
    termination date on the facility was extended to
    November 4, 2012. This facility replaced the previous
    $450,000,000 (U.S. dollar) and $100,000,000 (Canadian
    dollar) revolving credit agreements in the U.S. and Canada,
    respectively, both of which were terminated in November 2005.

During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, aggregate outstanding
    commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged
    from approximately zero to $1,133,241,000, $356,804,000 to
    $755,180,000, $126,846,000 to $774,530,000, respectively. There
    were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of
    June 28, 2008 or August 13, 2008.

Fixed
    Rate Debt

In July 2005, we repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling
    $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash
    flow from operations and commercial paper issuances.

In September 2005, we issued 5.375% senior notes totaling
    $500,000,000 due on September 21, 2035, under the April
    2005 shelf registration. These notes, which were priced at
    99.911% of par, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking
    fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows
    us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the
    greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to
    ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early
    redemption. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire
    commercial paper issuances outstanding as of September 2005.

In September 2005, in conjunction with the issuance of the
    5.375% senior notes described above, we settled a
    $350,000,000 notional amount forward-starting interest rate swap
    we had entered into in March 2005. Upon termination, we paid
    cash of $21,196,000, which represented the fair value liability
    associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination.
    This amount is being amortized as interest expense over the

30-year

term of the debt, and the unamortized balance is reflected as a
    loss, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income (loss).

In May 2006, we repaid at maturity the 7.0% senior notes
    totaling $200,000,000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from
    operations and commercial paper issuances.

In April 2007, we repaid at maturity the 7.25% senior notes
    totaling $100,000,000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from
    operations and commercial paper issuances.



In January 2008, the SEC granted our request to terminate our
    then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with
    the SEC in April 2005 for the issuance of debt securities. In
    February 2008, we filed an automatically effective well-known
    seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of
    up to $1,000,000,000 in debt securities with the SEC.

In February 2008, we issued 4.20% senior notes totaling
    $250,000,000 due February 12, 2013 (the “2013
    notes”) and 5.25% senior notes totaling $500,000,000
    due February 12, 2018 (the “2018 notes”) under
    our February 2008 shelf registration. The 2013 and 2018 notes,
    which were priced at 99.835% and 99.310% of par, respectively,
    are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement
    and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the
    notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus
    accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the
    noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption. Proceeds
    from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper
    issuances outstanding as of February 2008.

Total
    Debt

Total debt as of June 28, 2008 was $1,980,331,000, of which
    approximately 99% was at fixed rates averaging 5.4% and the
    remainder was at floating rates averaging 2.2%. Certain loan
    agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect
    noteholders, including provisions to maintain our long-term debt
    to total capital ratio below a specified level. We were in
    compliance with all debt covenants as of June 28, 2008.

Other

As part of normal business activities, we issue letters of
    credit through major banking institutions as required by certain
    vendor and insurance agreements. As of June 28, 2008 and
    June 30, 2007, letters of credit outstanding were
    $35,785,000 and $62,645,000, respectively.

Other
    Considerations

Multi-Employer
    Pension Plans

As discussed in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we
    contribute to several multi-employer defined benefit pension
    plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining
    agreements covering union-represented employees.

Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, our voluntary withdrawal or
    the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any
    underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would require us
    to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the
    multi-employer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. Based on
    the information available from plan administrators, we estimate
    that our share of withdrawal liability on most of the
    multi-employer plans we participate in, some of which appear to
    be underfunded, could be as much as $140,000,000 based on a
    voluntary withdrawal.

Required contributions to multi-employer plans could increase in
    the future as these plans strive to improve their funding
    levels. In addition, the Pension Protection Act, enacted in
    August 2006, requires underfunded pension plans to improve their
    funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of
    their underfunding. We believe that any unforeseen requirements
    to pay such increased contributions, withdrawal liability and
    excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations,
    borrowing capacity or a combination of these items. Of the plans
    in which SYSCO participates, one plan is more critically
    underfunded than the others. During fiscal 2008, we obtained
    information that this plan failed to satisfy minimum funding
    requirements for certain periods and believe it is probable that
    additional funding will be required as well as the payment of
    excise tax. As a result, we recorded a liability of
    approximately $16,500,000 related to our share of the minimum
    funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods.
    Currently, we believe that a majority of this amount will be
    paid in fiscal 2009 and are continuing to explore our
    alternatives as it relates to this plan. As of June 28,
    2008, we have approximately $22,000,000 in liabilities recorded
    in total related to certain underfunded multi-employer defined
    benefit plans.

BSCC
    Cooperative Structure

Our affiliate, BSCC, is a cooperative taxed under subchapter T
    of the United States Internal Revenue Code. We believe that the
    deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations
    and legal ownership of BSCC are appropriate under the tax laws.
    However, if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative
    structure of BSCC were to be successfully challenged by any
    federal, state or local tax authority, we could be required to
    accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax
    liabilities associated with BSCC that we otherwise have deferred
    until future periods. In that event, we would be liable for
    interest on such amounts. As of June 28, 2008, SYSCO has
    recorded deferred income tax liabilities of $1,054,190,000, net
    of federal benefit, related to the BSCC supply chain
    distributions. If the IRS and any other relevant taxing
    authorities determine that all amounts since the inception of
    BSCC were inappropriately deferred, and the determination is
    upheld, we estimate that in addition to making a current payment
    for amounts previously deferred, as discussed above, we may be
    required to pay interest on the cumulative deferred balances.
    These interest amounts could range from $290,000,000 to
    $320,000,000, prior to federal and state income tax benefit, as
    of June 28, 2008. SYSCO calculated this amount based upon
    the amounts deferred since the inception of BSCC applying the
    applicable jurisdictions’ interest rates in effect in each
    period. The IRS, in connection with its audit of our 2003 and
    2004 federal income tax returns, proposed adjustments related to
    the taxability of the cooperative structure. We are vigorously
    protesting these adjustments. We have reviewed the merits of the
    issues raised by the IRS, and while management believes it is
    probable we will prevail, we concluded the measurement model of
    FIN 48 required us to provide an accrual for a portion of
    the interest exposure. If a taxing authority requires us to
    accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to
    pay related interest,



if any, we may be required to raise additional capital through
    debt financing or we may have to forego share repurchases or
    defer planned capital expenditures or a combination of these
    items.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically
    payable only in the event that certain operating results are
    attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved.
    Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of
    June 28, 2008 included $55,469,000 in cash. This amount is
    not included in the table above.

No obligations were included in the table above for the
    qualified retirement plan because as of June 28, 2008, we
    do not have a minimum funding requirement under ERISA guidelines
    for this plan due to our previous voluntary contributions.
    However, we intend to make voluntary contributions to the
    qualified retirement plan totaling $80,000,000 during fiscal
    2009.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying
    financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed
    by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements.

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are
    most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
    results of operations. These policies require our most
    subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of
    estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
    uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical
    accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure.
    Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to
    the allowance for doubtful accounts



receivable, self-insurance programs, company-sponsored pension
    plans, income taxes, vendor consideration, accounting for
    business combinations and share-based compensation.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and
    determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on
    a combination of factors. We utilize specific criteria to
    determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including
    whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in
    bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for
    collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods.
    Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on
    analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries. In
    addition, in circumstances where we are aware of a specific
    customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation, a
    specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce
    the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be
    collected. Our judgment is required as to the impact of certain
    of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of
    our accounts receivables. If the financial condition of our
    customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be
    required.

Self-Insurance
    Program

We maintain a self-insurance program covering portions of
    workers’ compensation, general liability and vehicle
    liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured
    levels are fully insured by third party insurers. We also
    maintain a fully self-insured group medical program. Liabilities
    associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering
    historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic
    factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
    Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain
    because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and
    could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims
    differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an
    attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation,
    vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and
    awareness programs have been implemented.

Company-Sponsored
    Pension Plans

Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the
    financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Three
    of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations
    are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan
    benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future
    compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan
    assets.

For guidance in determining the discount rates, we calculate the
    implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of
    high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and
    amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of
    the pension plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed
    annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate
    for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the
    company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan),
    which was determined as of the June 30, 2007 measurement
    date, increased 0.05% to 6.78%. The discount rate for
    determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the SERP,
    which was determined as of the June 30, 2007 measurement
    date, decreased 0.09% to 6.64%. The combined effect of these
    discount rate changes was a decrease in our net
    company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2008 by
    an estimated $480,000. The discount rate for determining fiscal
    2009 net pension costs for the Retirement Plan, which was
    determined as of the June 28, 2008 measurement date,
    increased 0.16% to 6.94%. The discount rate for determining
    fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the SERP, which was
    determined as of the June 28, 2008 measurement date,
    increased 0.39% to 7.03%. The combined effect of these discount
    rate changes will decrease our net company-sponsored pension
    costs for all plans for fiscal 2009 by an estimated $8,692,000.
    A 1.0% increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2009 would
    decrease SYSCO’s net company-sponsored pension cost by
    $32,000,000, while a 1.0% decrease in the discount rates would
    increase pension cost by $49,000,000. The impact of a 1.0%
    increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a 1.0%
    decrease in discount rates because a 1.0% decrease in discount
    rates would require additional amounts of amortization from net
    actuarial losses which would not be required with a 1.0%
    increase in this rate. As of June 28, 2008, our net
    actuarial losses from our company-sponsored pension plans were
    $351,344,000, an increase of $192,438,000. We estimate the
    amortization of net actuarial losses will increase our fiscal
    2009 pension expense by approximately $14,000,000 as compared to
    fiscal 2008.

We look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of
    increase in compensation levels. We used a plan specific
    age-related set of rates for the Retirement Plan, which are
    equivalent to a single rate of 6.17% as of June 28, 2008
    and June 30, 2007. As of June 28, 2008, the SERP
    assumes various levels of base salary increase and decrease for
    determining pay for fiscal 2009 depending upon the
    participant’s position with the company and a 7% salary
    growth assumption for all participants for fiscal 2010 and
    thereafter. As of June 30, 2007, the SERP assumed salary
    rate increases of 10% through fiscal 2007 and 7% thereafter.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the
    Retirement Plan was 8.50% for fiscal 2008 and 9.00% for fiscal
    2007. The expectations of future returns are derived from a
    mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the
    various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of
    historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of
    the financial markets regarding the yield on long-term bonds and
    the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not
    determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of
    return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound
    averaging, was approximately 9.0%, 7.3%, 12.1% and 8.3% over the

20-year,

10-year,

5-year

and

1-year

periods ended December 31, 2007, respectively. In addition,
    in nine of the last 15 years, the actual return on plan
    assets has exceeded 10.0%. The rate of return assumption is
    reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.

The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount
    of net pension costs. The expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets of the Retirement Plan is 8.00% for fiscal 2009. A
    1.0% increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for
    fiscal 2009 would decrease (increase) SYSCO’s net
    company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2009 by approximately
    $15,900,000.



The adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of
    SFAS 158 as of June 30, 2007 resulted in the
    recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in
    the statement of financial position, with a corresponding
    adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
    tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
    loss as of June 30, 2007 after adoption of SFAS 158
    was a charge, net of tax, of $125,265,000, which represented the
    net actuarial losses, prior service costs and transition
    obligation remaining from the initial adoption of
    SFAS 87/106 as of that date. The amount reflected in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition
    of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of
    June 28, 2008 was a charge, net of tax, of $220,913,000.

Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount
    rate discussed above, together with the normal growth of the
    plans, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the
    timing and amount of contributions, decreased net
    company-sponsored pension costs by $8,754,000 in fiscal 2008 and
    are expected to increase net company-sponsored pension costs in
    fiscal 2009 by approximately $27,200,000. However, a change in
    the SERP design is expected to decrease net company-sponsored
    pension costs in fiscal 2009 by $7,200,000, for a net increase
    of approximately $20,000,000.

We made cash contributions to our company-sponsored pension
    plans of $92,670,000 and $91,163,000 in fiscal years 2008 and
    2007, respectively, including voluntary contributions to the
    Retirement Plan of $80,000,000 and $80,000,000 in fiscal 2008
    and fiscal 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2009, as in the
    previous years, contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be
    required to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements but we
    anticipate that we will make voluntary contributions of
    $80,000,000, which is not greater than the estimated maximum
    amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2009. The estimated
    fiscal 2009 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP
    and other post-retirement plans together are approximately
    $17,401,000.

Income
    Taxes

The determination of our provision for income taxes requires
    significant judgment, the use of estimates and the
    interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our
    provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income
    earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as
    well as Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions.
    Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in
    permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or
    adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or
    valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from
    these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax
    rate.

Prior to fiscal 2008, in evaluating the exposures connected with
    the various tax filing positions, we established an accrual
    when, despite our belief that our tax return positions were
    supportable, we believed that certain positions may be
    successfully challenged and a loss was probable. When facts and
    circumstances changed, these accruals were adjusted. Beginning
    in fiscal 2008, we adopted FIN 48, which changed the
    accounting for uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 provides
    that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be
    recognized when it is more likely than not that the position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the
    largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
    likelihood of being realized upon settlement. (See discussion
    under Note 16, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8).

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains
    uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions
    and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with
    our various filing positions. We believe that the judgments and
    estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual
    results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains
    that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for
    which a liability has been established, or pay amounts in excess
    of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a
    given financial statement period could be materially affected.
    An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our
    cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax
    rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may
    be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in
    the period of resolution.

Vendor
    Consideration

We recognize consideration received from vendors when the
    services performed in connection with the monies received are
    completed and when the related product has been sold by SYSCO.
    There are several types of cash consideration received from
    vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the
    form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these
    instances, we will recognize the vendor consideration as a
    reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In the
    situations where the vendor consideration is not related
    directly to specific product purchases, we will recognize these
    as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is
    complete, the related service is performed and the amounts
    realized. In certain of these latter instances, the vendor
    consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific
    incremental identifiable cost incurred by SYSCO. In these cases,
    we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with
    any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and
    recognize these in the period in which the costs are incurred
    and related services performed.

Accounting
    for Business Combinations

Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of
    consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets
    acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in
    determining the fair value of assets acquired, including
    goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the
    allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit.

In addition, annually or more frequently as needed, we assess
    the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles
    by determining whether the fair values of the applicable
    reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets. The
    reporting units used in assessing goodwill



impairment are our six operating segments as described in
    Note 19, Business Segment Information, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8. The components within each
    of our six operating segments have similar economic
    characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting
    units.

We arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of
    discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models. The results
    from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a
    single estimate of fair value for each of our six operating
    segments. The primary assumptions used in these various models
    include estimated average sales and earnings multiples of
    comparable acquisitions in the industry, average sales and
    earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by SYSCO in the
    past, future cash flow estimates of the reporting units and
    weighted average cost of capital, along with working capital and
    capital expenditure requirements.

Actual results could differ from these assumptions and
    projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions
    and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. Our past
    estimates of fair value for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 have not
    been materially different when revised to include subsequent
    years’ actual results. SYSCO has not made any material
    changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past
    three fiscal years. We do not believe the estimates used in the
    analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the
    future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the
    future based on the expectations of the reporting units. In
    fiscal 2008, the reporting units’ fair values would have
    had to have been lower by 20% compared to the fair values
    estimated in our impairment analysis before additional analysis
    would have been indicated to determine if an impairment existed
    for any of our reporting units.

The Other (specialty produce, custom-cut meat, lodging industry
    products and international distribution operations) operating
    segments have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to
    estimated fair value as compared to the Broadline or SYGMA
    reporting units. This is primarily due to these businesses
    having been recently acquired, and as a result there has been
    less history of organic growth than in the Broadline and SYGMA
    segments. In addition, these businesses also have lower levels
    of cash flow than the Broadline segment. As such, these Other
    operating segments have a greater risk of future impairment if
    their operations were to suffer a significant downturn.

Share-Based
    Compensation

We provide compensation benefits to employees and non-employee
    directors under several share-based payment arrangements
    including various employee stock incentive plans, the
    Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive
    Plan and various non-employee director plans.

Effective July 3, 2005, we adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the
    modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition
    method, compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 and later
    years includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted through July 2, 2005, but for which the
    requisite service period had not been completed as of
    July 2, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated
    in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and
    b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    subsequent to July 2, 2005, based on the grant date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS 123(R). Results for periods prior to fiscal 2006 have
    not been restated.

As of June 28, 2008, there was $66,432,000 of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based
    compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.88 years.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected
    volatility is based on historical volatility of SYSCO’s
    stock, implied volatilities from traded options on SYSCO’s
    stock and other factors. We utilize historical data to estimate
    option exercise and employee termination behavior within the
    valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar
    historical exercise behavior are considered separately for
    valuation purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based
    on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock
    price for the year preceding the option grant. The risk-free
    rate for the expected term of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The fair value of the stock issued under the Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan is calculated as the difference between the stock
    price and the employee purchase price. The fair value of the
    stock issued under the Management Incentive Plans is based on
    the stock price less a 12% discount for post-vesting
    restrictions. The discount for post-vesting restrictions is
    estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating
    the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the
    restriction period.

The compensation cost related to these share-based awards is
    recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite
    service period is generally the period during which an employee
    is required to provide service in exchange for the award.

The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from
    awards under the Management Incentive Plan was accrued over the
    fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates. The
    compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from
    employee purchases of stock under the Employees’ Stock
    Purchase Plan is recognized during the quarter in which the
    employee payroll withholdings are made.

Certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded
    vesting over a service period. In those cases, we will recognize
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. In other cases, certain of
    our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service
    period but include a performance-based provision allowing for
    the vesting to accelerate. In these cases, if it is probable
    that the performance condition will be met, we recognize
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the shorter
    performance period; otherwise, we recognize compensation cost
    over the probable longer service period.



In addition, certain of our options provide that if the optionee
    retires at certain age and years of service thresholds, the
    options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an
    employee or director. In these cases, for awards granted prior
    to July 2, 2005, we will recognize the compensation cost
    for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate
    any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee
    retires. For awards granted subsequent to July 3, 2005, we
    will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period
    from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes
    eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after
    retirement.

Our option grants include options that qualify as incentive
    stock options for income tax purposes. In the period the
    compensation cost related to incentive stock options is
    recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is
    assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such
    incentive stock options. We may be eligible for tax deductions
    in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a
    disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option. In such
    cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax
    deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding
    cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial
    statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory
    tax rate.

New
    Accounting Standards

SFAS 159

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Liabilities” (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits
    entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of
    an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
    November 15, 2007. We have decided not to adopt
    SFAS 159 for our existing financial assets and liabilities
    at the date of option. Thus, there will be no one-time impact
    from adoption of this standard to our consolidated financial
    statements.

SFAS 141(R)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141(R)), which
    establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in a business combination. This
    statement also establishes recognition and measurement
    principles for the goodwill acquired in a business combination
    and disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users
    to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
    combination. We will apply this statement primarily on a
    prospective basis for business combinations beginning in fiscal
    2010. Earlier application of the standard is prohibited.

FSP

157-2

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157), which
    establishes a common definition for fair value under generally
    accepted accounting principles, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about
    such fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position

157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

(FSP 157-2),

which partially defers the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for one year for non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the financial statements on a non-recurring basis. Consequently,
    SFAS 157 will be effective for SYSCO in fiscal 2009 for
    financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and
    non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. As a result of the
    deferral, SFAS 157 will be effective in fiscal 2010 for
    non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value. We believe the adoption
    of SFAS 157 in fiscal 2009 for financial assets and
    liabilities carried at fair value and non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
    recurring basis will not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements. We are continuing to evaluate
    the impact of adopting the provisions of SFAS 157 in fiscal
    2010 for non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value.

SFAS 161

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures
    about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities and
    thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. This
    statement will be effective for SYSCO’s financial
    statements beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We
    are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of
    SFAS 161 may have on its financial statement disclosures.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or
    express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect
    to the occurrence of future events are forward-looking
    statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995. They include statements about SYSCO’s ability to
    increase its sales and market share and grow earnings, the
    continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence
    and our business, expense trends, anticipated multi-employer
    pension related liabilities and contributions to various
    multi-employer pension plans, the outcome of ongoing tax audits,
    the impact of ongoing legal proceedings, the loss of
    SYSCO’s largest customer not having a material adverse
    effect on SYSCO as a whole, compliance with laws and government
    regulations not having a material effect on our capital
    expenditures, earnings or competitive position, long-term debt
    to capitalization ratios, anticipated capital expenditures and
    the sources of financing for those capital expenditures,
    continued competitive advantages and positive results from
    strategic business initiatives, anticipated company-sponsored
    pension



plan liabilities, the availability and adequacy of insurance to
    cover liabilities, the impact of future adoption of accounting
    pronouncements, predictions regarding the impact of changes in
    estimates used in impairment analyses, the anticipated impact of
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and SYSCO’s
    ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable.

These statements are based on management’s current
    expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially
    due in part to the risk factors discussed at Item 1.A.
    above and elsewhere. In addition, the success of SYSCO’s
    strategic business initiatives could be affected by conditions
    in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the
    ability to control expenses, including fuel costs. The ability
    to meet long-term debt to capitalization ratios also may be
    affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share
    repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth.
    Company-sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a
    number of factors including the discount rate for determining
    the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate
    of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate
    of return on plan assets. Legal proceedings are impacted by
    events, circumstances and individuals beyond the control of
    SYSCO. Predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting
    pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of
    precedent, and if our estimates turn out to be materially
    incorrect, our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement
    could prove incorrect, as well. The anticipated impact of
    compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that
    estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect, and laws and
    regulations, as well as methods of enforcement, are subject to
    change.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes.
    Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk.
    Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates
    periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market
    interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is
    fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in
    market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt
    and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with
    new debt at higher rates.

We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired
    position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest
    rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from
    interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates
    affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential
    increases in interest expense due to market increases in
    floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the
    counterparties in such transactions.

Fiscal

As of June 28, 2008, we had no commercial paper
    outstanding. Our long-term debt obligations as of June 28,
    2008 were $1,980,331,000, of which approximately 99% were at
    fixed rates of interest. We had no interest rate swaps
    outstanding as of June 28, 2008.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We have Canadian subsidiaries, all of which use the Canadian
    dollar as their functional currency with the exception of a
    financing subsidiary. To the extent that business transactions
    are not denominated in Canadian dollars, we are exposed to
    foreign currency exchange rate risk. We will also incur gains
    and losses within shareholders’ equity due to translation
    of the financial statements from Canadian dollars to
    U.S. dollars. Our Canadian financing subsidiary has notes
    denominated in U.S. dollars, which has the potential to
    create taxable income in Canada when the debt is paid due to
    changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt
    through the payment date. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal
    2008 year-end exchange rate and the resulting increase in
    the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a
    material impact on our results of operations. We do not
    routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign
    currency risks.

Fuel
    Price Risk

The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to
    changes in production, seasonality and other market factors
    generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have
    a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas.
    First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer
    confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the
    frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away
    from home. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price
    we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass
    these costs fully to our customers. Third, increased fuel costs
    impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers.
    During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, fuel costs related to
    outbound deliveries represented approximately 0.6%, 0.6% and
    0.5% of sales, respectively. Fuel costs, excluding any amounts
    recovered through fuel surcharges, incurred by SYSCO increased
    by approximately $34,023,000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and
    $21,225,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006.

From time to time, we will enter into forward purchase
    commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel
    requirements. As of June 28, 2008, we had no outstanding
    forward diesel fuel purchase commitments. In July and August
    2008, we entered into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments
    totaling approximately $195,000,000 through July 2009, which
    will lock in the price on approximately 50% of our fuel
    purchases through the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 and
    approximately 70% of our fuel purchases needs for the last
    26 weeks of fiscal 2009.

If fuel prices continue at current levels, fuel costs in the
    first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009, exclusive of any amounts
    recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to increase by
    approximately $55,000,000 to $65,000,000 as compared to the
    first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008. Our estimate is based upon
    the prevailing market prices for diesel mid-August 2008, the
    cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements
    currently in place and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual
    fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these
    assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary
    significantly from our current estimates. A 10% unfavorable or
    favorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in
    our estimates above would change the range of potential increase
    to $50,000,000 to $70,000,000.

REPORT
    OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The management of SYSCO Corporation (“SYSCO”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting for the company. SYSCO’s
    internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
    statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well
    designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
    systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
    assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
    presentation.

SYSCO’s management assessed the effectiveness of
    SYSCO’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    June 28, 2008. In making this assessment, it used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, management
    concluded that, as of June 28, 2008, SYSCO’s internal
    control over financial reporting was effective based on those
    criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the
    effectiveness of SYSCO’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of June 28, 2008.



REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

SYSCO Corporation

We have audited SYSCO Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and
    its subsidiaries (the “Company”) internal control over
    financial reporting as of June 28, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the COSO criteria). SYSCO Corporation’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, SYSCO Corporation and its subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of June 28, 2008, based on the
    COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of June 28, 2008 and
    June 30, 2007 and the related consolidated results of
    operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended June 28, 2008 of SYSCO
    Corporation and its subsidiaries and our report dated
    August 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

SYSCO Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    SYSCO Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of June 28, 2008 and June 30,
    2007, and the related consolidated results of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended June 28, 2008. These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of the Company at June 28, 2008 and
    June 30, 2007, and the consolidated results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended June 28, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure
    provisions, effective June 30, 2007, and the change in
    measurement date provision, effective July 1, 2007, of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”. Also,
    discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective July 1, 2007, SYSCO Corporation
    adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), which clarifies
    the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes” (SFAS 109).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of SYSCO Corporation and subsidiaries internal
    control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2008, based
    on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated August 26, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY
    OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business
    and Consolidation

Sysco Corporation, (SYSCO or the company), acting through its
    subsidiaries and divisions, is engaged in the marketing and
    distribution of a wide range of food and related products
    primarily to the foodservice or
    “food-prepared-away-from-home” industry. These
    services are performed for over 400,000 customers from 180
    distribution facilities located throughout the United States and
    Canada.

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of
    SYSCO and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany transactions and account balances have been
    eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, sales and expenses. Actual results could differ
    from the estimates used.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

For cash flow purposes, cash includes cash equivalents such as
    time deposits, certificates of deposit, short-term investments
    and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of
    three months or less.

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from
    customers and receivables from suppliers for marketing or
    incentive programs. SYSCO determines the past due status of
    trade receivables based on contractual terms with each customer.
    SYSCO evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and
    determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based
    on a combination of factors. The company utilizes specific
    criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written
    off including whether a customer has filed for or been placed in
    bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for
    collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods.
    Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on an
    analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries. In
    addition, in circumstances where the company is aware of a
    specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligation to SYSCO, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts
    is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount
    reasonably expected to be collected. In addition, allowances are
    recorded for all other receivables based on an analysis of
    historical trends of write-offs and recoveries.

Inventories

Inventories consisting primarily of finished goods include food
    and related products and lodging products held for resale and
    are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Elements of costs include the
    purchase price of the product and freight charges to deliver the
    product to the company’s warehouses and are net of certain
    cash or non-cash consideration received from vendors (see
    “Vendor Consideration”).

Plant
    and Equipment

Capital additions, improvements and major replacements are
    classified as plant and equipment and are carried at cost.
    Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which
    reduces the book value of each asset in equal amounts over its
    estimated useful life, and is included within operating expenses
    in the consolidated results of operations. Maintenance, repairs
    and minor replacements are charged to earnings when they are
    incurred. Upon the disposition of an asset, its accumulated
    depreciation is deducted from the original cost, and any gain or
    loss is reflected in current earnings.

Applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of
    new facilities and development of software for internal use are
    capitalized as one of the elements of cost and are amortized
    over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Interest
    capitalized for the past three years was $6,805,000 in 2008,
    $3,955,000 in 2007 and $2,853,000 in 2006.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Management reviews long-lived assets, including finite-lived
    intangibles, for indicators of impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
    not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the
    related assets are estimated over the asset’s useful life
    based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that
    the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the
    potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted
    cash flow model.

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

Goodwill and intangibles represent the excess of cost over the
    fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Goodwill and
    intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles
    with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their useful lives, which generally range from three to ten
    years.

Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to
    benefit from the synergies of the combination. The
    recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is
    assessed annually, or more frequently as needed when events or
    changes have occurred that would suggest an



impairment of carrying value, by determining whether the fair
    values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying
    values. The reporting units used to assess goodwill impairment
    are the company’s six operating segments as described in
    Note 19, Business Segment Information. The components
    within each of the six operating segments have similar economic
    characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting
    units. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of
    projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future
    performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash
    flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and
    earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable
    acquisitions.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133),
    requires the recognition of all derivatives as assets or
    liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets at fair
    value. Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments
    designated as fair value hedges have been recognized immediately
    in the consolidated results of operations, along with the
    offsetting gain or loss related to the underlying hedged item.

Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated
    as cash flow hedges have been recorded as a separate component
    of shareholders’ equity at their settlement, whereby gains
    or losses are reclassified to the Consolidated Results of
    Operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying
    hedged item.

In the normal course of business, SYSCO enters into forward
    purchase agreements for the procurement of fuel, electricity and
    product commodities related to SYSCO’s business. These
    agreements meet the definition of a derivative. However, the
    company elected to use the normal purchase and sale exemption
    available under SFAS 133 (as amended and interpreted);
    therefore, these agreements are not recorded at fair value.

Treasury
    Stock

The company records treasury stock purchases at cost. Shares
    removed from treasury are valued at cost using the average cost
    method.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries are
    translated at current exchange rates. Related translation
    adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss).

Revenue
    Recognition

The company recognizes revenue from the sale of a product when
    it is considered to be realized or realizable and earned. The
    company determines these requirements to be met at the point at
    which the product is delivered to the customer. The company
    grants certain customers sales incentives such as rebates or
    discounts and treats these as a reduction of sales at the time
    the sale is recognized. Sales tax collected from customers is
    not included in revenue but rather recorded as a liability due
    to the respective taxing authorities. Purchases and sales of
    inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
    contemplation of one another are considered to be a single
    nonmonetary transaction. Beginning in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, the company recorded the net effect of such
    transactions in the consolidated results of operations within
    sales as a result of a new accounting standard, EITF Issue

No. 04-13,

“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory With the
    Same Counterparty,”

(EITF 04-13).

See further discussion in Note 2, Changes in Accounting.

Vendor
    Consideration

SYSCO recognizes consideration received from vendors when the
    services performed in connection with the monies received are
    completed and when the related product has been sold by SYSCO as
    a reduction to cost of sales. There are several types of cash
    consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the
    vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per
    case or per pound. In these instances, SYSCO will recognize the
    vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the
    product is sold. In the situations where the vendor
    consideration is not related directly to specific product
    purchases, SYSCO will recognize these as a reduction of cost of
    sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service
    is performed and the amounts realized. In certain of these
    latter instances, the vendor consideration represents a
    reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost
    incurred by SYSCO. In these cases, SYSCO classifies the
    consideration as a reduction of those costs, with any excess
    funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes
    these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related
    services performed.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs include costs associated with the
    selection of products and delivery to customers. Included in
    operating expenses are shipping and handling costs of
    approximately $2,155,794,000 in fiscal 2008, $1,977,516,000 in
    fiscal 2007, and $1,857,093,000 in fiscal 2006.

Insurance
    Program

SYSCO maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of
    workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability costs.
    The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully
    insured by third party insurers. The company also maintains a
    fully self-insured group medical program. Liabilities associated
    with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical
    claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors,
    severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.



Share-Based
    Compensation

SYSCO recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based
    on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value
    of the stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option pricing methods
    require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
    the expected stock price volatility. Measured compensation cost
    is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related
    share-based compensation award. Cash flows resulting from tax
    deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for
    those options (excess tax benefits) are classified as financing
    cash flows on the consolidated cash flows statements.

Acquisitions

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting, and the financial statements include the
    results of the acquired operations from the respective dates
    they joined SYSCO.

The purchase price of the acquired entities is allocated to the
    net assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the
    estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition, with any
    excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired,
    including intangibles, recognized as goodwill. The balances
    included in the consolidated balance sheets related to recent
    acquisitions are based upon preliminary information and are
    subject to change when final asset and liability valuations are
    obtained. Material changes to the preliminary allocations are
    not anticipated by management.

CHANGES
    IN ACCOUNTING

FIN 48

Effective July 1, 2007, SYSCO adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting
    for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the application of
    SFAS 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax
    position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position
    to be recognized in the financial statements. Additionally,
    FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition,
    classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with
    accounting for the related interest and penalties. The impact of
    adopting this standard is discussed in Note 16, Income
    Taxes.

Pension
    Measurement Date Change and SFAS 158
    Adoption

Beginning in fiscal 2006, SYSCO changed the measurement date for
    the company-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefit
    plans from fiscal year-end to May 31st, which represented a
    change in accounting. Management believes this accounting change
    was preferable, as the one-month acceleration of the measurement
    date allowed additional time for management to evaluate and
    report the actuarial pension measurements in the year-end
    financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated
    filing deadlines of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
    cumulative effect of this change in accounting resulted in an
    increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of
    $9,285,000, net of tax. The impact to pro forma net earnings and
    earnings per share adjusted for the effect of retroactive
    application of the change in measurement date on net
    company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2005 was not material.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”
    (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 has two major provisions. The
    recognition and disclosure provision requires an employer to
    recognize a plan’s funded status in its statement of
    financial position and recognize the changes in a defined
    benefit postretirement plan’s funded status in
    comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The
    measurement date provision requires an employer to measure a
    plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the
    employer’s fiscal year. SYSCO adopted SFAS 158’s
    recognition and disclosure requirements as of June 30,
    2007. In addition, SYSCO elected to early adopt the measurement
    date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this
    accounting standard at the same time. See discussion of the
    impact of adoption in Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans.

EITF

04-13

Adoption

In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a
    consensus on

EITF 04-13

which requires that two or more inventory transactions with the
    same counterparty (as defined) should be viewed as a single
    nonmonetary transaction if the transactions were entered into in
    contemplation of one another. Exchanges of inventory between
    entities in the same line of business should be accounted for at
    fair value or recorded at carrying amounts, depending on the
    classification of such inventory. This guidance was effective
    for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 for SYSCO. SYSCO has
    certain transactions where finished goods are purchased from a
    customer or sourced by that customer for warehousing and
    distribution and resold to the same customer. These transactions
    are evidenced by title transfer and are separately invoiced.
    Historically, the company has recorded such transactions in the
    consolidated results of operations within cost of sales for the
    purchase amount and within sales for the sales amount. In fiscal
    2008 and 2007, the company recorded the net effect of such
    transactions in the consolidated results of operations within
    sales by reducing sales and cost of sales in the amount of
    $338,907,000 and $334,002,000, respectively. In the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006, the company recorded the net effect of
    such transactions in the consolidated results of operations
    within sales by reducing sales and cost of sales in the amount
    of $99,803,000. The amount included in the consolidated results
    of operations within cost of sales for the 39 week period
    ended April 1, 2006 that were recorded on a gross basis
    prior to the adoption of

EITF 04-13

was $279,746,000. This amount was not restated when the new
    standard was adopted because only prospective treatment was
    allowed.



SFAS 123(R)
    Adoption

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS 123(R)), which is a
    revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123). SFAS 123(R)
    supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” (APB Opinion 25), and amends
    SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” In
    fiscal 2006, SYSCO adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R)
    utilizing the modified-prospective transition method under which
    prior period results have not been restated. See discussion of
    the impact of adoption in Note 15, Share-Based Compensation.

3.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS 159

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Liabilities” (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits
    entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of
    an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
    November 15, 2007. The company decided not to adopt
    SFAS 159 for its existing financial assets and liabilities
    at the date of option. Thus, there will be no one-time impact
    from adoption of this standard to its consolidated financial
    statements.

SFAS 141(R)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141(R)), which
    establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in a business combination. This
    statement also establishes recognition and measurement
    principles for the goodwill acquired in a business combination
    and disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users
    to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
    combination. SYSCO will apply this statement primarily on a
    prospective basis for business combinations beginning in fiscal
    2010. Earlier application of the standard is prohibited.

FSP

157-2

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157), which
    establishes a common definition for fair value under generally
    accepted accounting principles, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about
    such fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position

157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

(FSP 157-2),

which partially defers the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for one year for non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the financial statements on a non-recurring basis. Consequently,
    SFAS 157 will be effective for SYSCO in fiscal 2009 for
    financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and
    non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. As a result of the
    deferral, SFAS 157 will be effective in fiscal 2010 for
    non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value. The adoption of
    SFAS 157 in fiscal 2009 for financial assets and
    liabilities carried at fair value and non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
    recurring basis will not have a material impact on the
    company’s consolidated financial statements. The company is
    continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting the provisions of
    SFAS 157 in fiscal 2010 for non-recurring, non-financial
    assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair
    value.

SFAS 161

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures
    about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities and
    thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. This
    Statement will be effective for SYSCO’s financial
    statements beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The
    company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of
    SFAS 161 may have on its financial statement disclosures.

RESTRICTED
    CASH

SYSCO is required by its insurers to collateralize a part of the
    self-insured portion of its workers’ compensation and
    liability claims. SYSCO has chosen to satisfy these collateral
    requirements by depositing funds in insurance trusts or by
    issuing letters of credit.

In addition, for certain acquisitions, SYSCO has placed funds
    into escrow to be disbursed to the sellers in the event that
    specified operating results are attained or contingencies are
    resolved. During fiscal 2008, escrowed funds in the amount of
    $7,000,000 were released to sellers of acquired businesses. In
    addition, escrowed funds of $2,000,000 were released from escrow
    related to an acquisition for which the contingent consideration
    period expired without the additional consideration being earned.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SYSCO manages its debt portfolio by targeting an overall desired
    position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest
    rate swaps from time to time to achieve this goal. The company
    does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes.

In March 2005, SYSCO entered into a forward-starting interest
    rate swap with a notional amount of $350,000,000. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, the company designated this
    derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash
    outflows of interest payments on $350,000,000 of the September
    2005 forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark
    interest rate. In September 2005, in conjunction with the
    issuance of the 5.375% senior notes, SYSCO settled the
    $350,000,000 notional amount forward-starting interest rate
    swap. Upon settlement, SYSCO paid cash of $21,196,000, which
    represented the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of
    settlement. This amount is being amortized as interest expense
    over the

30-year

term of the debt, and the unamortized balance is reflected as a
    loss, net of tax, in other comprehensive income (loss).

9.

SELF-INSURED
    LIABILITIES

SYSCO maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of
    workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability costs.
    The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully
    insured by third party insurers. The company also maintains a
    fully self-insured group medical program. A summary of the
    activity in self-insured liabilities appears below:

Short-term
    Borrowings

SYSCO has uncommitted bank lines of credit, which as of
    June 28, 2008 provided for unsecured borrowings for working
    capital of up to $145,000,000. Borrowings outstanding under
    these lines of credit were zero and $18,900,000, as of
    June 28, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively.

Commercial
    Paper

SYSCO has a commercial paper program allowing the company to
    issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to
    exceed $1,300,000,000.

SYSCO and one of its subsidiaries, SYSCO International, Co.,
    have a revolving credit facility supporting the company’s
    U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs. The facility
    in the amount of $1,000,000,000 terminates on November 4,
    2012, subject to extension. Since this long-term facility
    supports the company’s commercial paper programs, the
    $531,826,000 of outstanding commercial paper issuances as of
    June 30, 2007 was classified as long-term debt. There were
    no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of June 28,
    2008.

This facility was originally entered into in November 2005 in
    the amount of $500,000,000 and was increased to $750,000,000 in
    March 2006. In September 2006, the termination date on the
    facility was extended to November 4, 2011, in accordance
    with the terms of the agreement. In September 2007, the amount
    of the facility was increased to $1,000,000,000 and the
    termination date on the facility was extended to
    November 4, 2012. This facility replaced the previous
    $450,000,000 (U.S. dollar) and $100,000,000 (Canadian
    dollar) revolving credit agreements in the U.S. and Canada,
    respectively, both of which were terminated in November 2005.

During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, aggregate outstanding
    commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged
    from approximately zero to $1,113,241,000, $356,804,000 to
    $755,180,000, and $126,846,000 to $774,530,000 respectively.

Fixed
    Rate Debt

In July 2005, SYSCO repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling
    $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash
    flow from operations and commercial paper issuances.

In September 2005, SYSCO issued 5.375% senior notes
    totaling $500,000,000 due on September 21, 2035, under its
    April 2005 shelf registration. These notes, which were priced at
    99.911% of par, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking
    fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows
    SYSCO to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the
    greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to
    ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire
    commercial paper issuances outstanding as of September 2005.

In September 2005, in conjunction with the issuance of the
    5.375% senior notes, SYSCO settled a $350,000,000 notional
    amount forward-starting interest rate swap which was designated
    as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of
    interest payments on the debt issuance due to changes in the
    benchmark interest rate. See Note 8, Derivative Financial
    Instruments, for further discussion.

In May 2006, SYSCO repaid the 7.0% senior notes totaling
    $200,000,000 at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow
    from operations and commercial paper issuances.

In April 2007, SYSCO repaid the 7.25% senior notes totaling
    $100,000,000 at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow
    from operations and commercial paper issuances.

In January 2008, the SEC granted our request to terminate our
    then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with
    the SEC in April 2005 for the issuance of debt securities. In
    February 2008, we filed an automatically effective well-known
    seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of
    up to $1,000,000,000 in debt securities with the SEC.

In February 2008, we issued 4.20% senior notes totaling
    $250,000,000 due February 12, 2013 (the “2013
    notes”) and 5.25% senior notes totaling $500,000,000
    due February 12, 2018 (the “2018 notes”) under
    our February 2008 shelf registration. The 2013 and 2018 notes,
    which were priced at 99.835% and 99.310% of par, respectively,
    are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement
    and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the
    notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus
    accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note
    holders are not penalized by the early redemption. Proceeds from
    the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances
    outstanding as of February 2008.

The 4.60% senior notes due March 15, 2014 and the
    6.5% debentures due August 1, 2028 are unsecured, are
    not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a
    redemption provision that allows SYSCO to retire the debentures
    and notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par
    plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the
    debenture and note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

The 7.16% debentures due April 15, 2027 are unsecured,
    are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and are no
    longer redeemable prior to maturity.

The 6.10% senior notes due June 1, 2012 , issued by
    SYSCO International, Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SYSCO,
    are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco Corporation,
    are not subject to any sinking fund requirement, and include a
    redemption provision which



allows SYSCO International, Co. to retire the notes at any time
    prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or
    an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not
    penalized by the early redemption.

SYSCO’s Industrial Revenue Bonds have varying structures.
    Final maturities range from three to 18 years and certain
    of the bonds provide SYSCO the right to redeem the bonds at
    various dates. These redemption provisions generally provide the
    bondholder a premium in the early redemption years, declining to
    par value as the bonds approach maturity.

Total
    Debt

Total debt as of June 28, 2008 was $1,980,331,000, of which
    approximately 99% was at fixed rates averaging 5.4% with an
    average life of 14 years, and the remainder was at floating
    rates averaging 2.2%. Certain loan agreements contain typical
    debt covenants to protect note holders, including provisions to
    maintain the company’s long-term debt to total capital
    ratio below a specified level. SYSCO was in compliance with all
    debt covenants as of June 28, 2008.

The fair value of SYSCO’s total long-term debt is estimated
    based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues
    or on the current rates offered to the company for debt of the
    same remaining maturities. The fair value of total long-term
    debt approximated $1,928,595,000 as of June 28, 2008 and
    $1,693,619,000 as of June 30, 2007, respectively.

Other

As of June 28, 2008 and June 30, 2007 letters of
    credit outstanding were $35,785,000 and $62,645,000,
    respectively.

11.

LEASES

Although SYSCO normally purchases assets, it has obligations
    under capital and operating leases for certain distribution
    facilities, vehicles and computers. Total rental expense under
    operating leases was $95,315,000, $94,163,000, and $100,690,000,
    in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Contingent rentals,
    subleases and assets and obligations under capital leases are
    not significant.

Aggregate minimum lease payments by fiscal year under existing
    non-capitalized long-term leases are as follows:

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

SYSCO has defined benefit and defined contribution retirement
    plans for its employees. Also, the company contributes to
    various multi-employer plans under collective bargaining
    agreements and provides certain health care benefits to eligible
    retirees and their dependents.

SYSCO maintains a qualified retirement plan (Retirement Plan)
    that pays benefits to employees at retirement, using formulas
    based on a participant’s years of service and compensation.

The defined contribution 401(k) plan provides that under certain
    circumstances the company may make matching contributions of up
    to 50% of the first 6% of a participant’s compensation.
    SYSCO’s contributions to this plan were $31,901,000 in
    2008, $26,032,000 in 2007, and $21,898,000 in 2006.

SYSCO’s contributions to multi-employer pension plans were
    $35,040,000, $32,974,000, and $29,796,000 in fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. See further discussion of SYSCO’s
    participation in multi-employer pension plans in Note 18,
    Commitments and Contingencies.

In addition to receiving benefits upon retirement under the
    company’s defined benefit plan, participants in the
    Management Incentive Plan (see

“Management Incentive
    Compensation”

in Note 15, Share-Based Compensation
    Plans) will receive benefits under a Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan (SERP). This plan is a nonqualified, unfunded
    supplementary retirement plan.

Adoption
    of SFAS 158

On June 30, 2007, SYSCO adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires
    the company to recognize the funded status of its
    company-sponsored defined benefit plans in its statement of
    financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The
    adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption
    represents the net actuarial losses, prior service costs, and
    transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of
    SFAS 87/106, all of which were previously netted against
    the funded status of the plans in the company’s statement
    of financial position pursuant to the provisions of
    SFAS 87/106. These amounts will subsequently be recognized
    as net benefit cost consistent with the company’s
    historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. In
    addition, actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent
    periods and are not recognized as net periodic benefit cost in
    the same periods will be recognized as a component of other
    comprehensive income. Those amounts will subsequently be
    recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost on the
    same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other
    comprehensive income at the adoption of SFAS 158.



The effects of the adoption of the recognition and disclosure
    provisions of SFAS 158 on the company’s consolidated
    balance sheet as of June 30, 2007 are presented in the
    following table. The adoption of SFAS 158 had no effect on
    the company’s consolidated results of operations for the
    fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, or for any prior period
    presented, and it will not affect the company’s
    consolidated results of operations in future periods. Prior to
    the adoption of SFAS 158 on June 30, 2007, the company
    recognized an additional minimum pension liability pursuant to
    the provisions of SFAS 87/106. The effect of recognizing
    the additional minimum pension liability is included in the
    table below in the column labeled “Prior to Adopting
    SFAS 158.”

SFAS 158 also has a measurement date provision, which is a
    requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of
    the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of
    financial position, effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2008. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006,
    SYSCO changed the measurement date for company-sponsored pension
    and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal year-end to
    May 31st to allow additional time for management to
    evaluate and report the actuarial pension measurements in the
    year-end financial statements and disclosures within the
    accelerated filing deadlines of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting
    resulted in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2006 of $9,285,000, net of tax. With the issuance of
    SFAS 158, SYSCO elected to early adopt the measurement date
    provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting
    standard at the same time. As a result, beginning in fiscal
    2008, the measurement date for all plans returned to correspond
    with fiscal year-end. The company performed measurements as of
    May 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 of the plan assets and
    benefit obligations. SYSCO recorded a charge to beginning
    retained earnings on July 1, 2007 of $3,572,000, net of
    tax, for the impact of the difference in our company-sponsored
    pension expense between the two measurement dates. The company
    also recorded a benefit to beginning accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) on July 1, 2007 of $22,780,000,
    net of tax, for the impact of the difference in the recognition
    provision between the two measurement dates.

In order to meet a portion of its obligations under the SERP,
    SYSCO maintains life insurance policies on the lives of the
    participants with carrying values of $129,480,000 as of
    June 28, 2008 and $131,011,000 as of June 30, 2007.
    These policies are not included as plan assets or in the funded

Primarily as a result of the funded status and expected asset
    performance of the Retirement Plan, net company-sponsored
    pension costs decreased $8,754,000 in fiscal 2008. Net
    company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 are expected to
    increase by approximately $20,000,000 due primarily to lower

Employer
    Contributions

The company made cash contributions to its company-sponsored
    pension plans of $92,670,000 and $91,163,000 in fiscal years
    2008 and 2007, respectively, including $80,000,000 in voluntary
    contributions to the Retirement Plan in both fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively. In fiscal 2009, as in previous years,
    contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be required to
    meet ERISA minimum funding requirements, yet the company
    anticipates it will make voluntary contributions of
    approximately $80,000,000. The company’s contributions to
    the SERP and other post-retirement plans are made in the amounts
    needed to fund current year benefit payments. The estimated
    fiscal 2009 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP
    and other postretirement plans are $17,082,000 and $319,000,
    respectively.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit
    obligations as of year-end were:

For determining the benefit obligations as of June 28,
    2008, the SERP calculations assume various levels of base salary
    increase and decrease for determining pay for fiscal 2009
    depending upon the participant’s position with the company
    and a 7% salary growth assumption for all participants for
    fiscal 2010 and thereafter. For determining the benefit
    obligations as of June 30, 2007, the SERP calculations
    assumed annual salary increases of 10% through fiscal 2007 and
    7% thereafter.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net
    company-sponsored pension costs and other postretirement benefit
    costs for each fiscal year were:

5.89

For determining net pension costs related to the SERP for each
    fiscal year, the calculation for fiscal 2008 assumes annual
    salary increases of 7%. The calculations for fiscal 2007 and
    2006 assumed annual salary increases of 10% through fiscal 2007
    and 7% thereafter.

A healthcare cost trend rate is not used in the calculations of
    postretirement benefits obligations because SYSCO subsidizes the
    cost of postretirement medical coverage by a fixed dollar
    amount, with the retiree responsible for the cost of coverage in
    excess of the subsidy, including all future cost increases.

For guidance in determining the discount rate, SYSCO calculates
    the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of
    high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and
    amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of
    the company-sponsored pension plans. The discount rate
    assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed
    appropriate. The discount rate to be used for the calculation of
    fiscal 2009 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the
    Retirement Plan and Other Postretirement Plans is 6.94%. The
    discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal
    2009 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the SERP is
    7.03%.



The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived
    from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as
    to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of
    rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward-looking
    views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long-term
    bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. The
    rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as
    deemed appropriate. The expected long-term rate of return to be
    used in the calculation of fiscal 2009 net
    company-sponsored benefit costs for the Retirement Plan is 8.00%.

The measurement date for fiscal 2006 and 2007 was May 31st.
    As discussed above under

SFAS 158 Adoption

, an
    additional measurement was performed as of June 30, 2007.
    The measurement date for fiscal 2008 was fiscal year-end.

Investment
    Policy and Assets

SYSCO’s investment objectives target a mix of investments
    that can potentially achieve an above-average rate of return.
    SYSCO has determined that this strategy is appropriate due to
    the relatively low ratio of retirees as a percentage of
    participants, low average years of participant service and low
    average age of participants and is willing to accept the
    above-average level of short-term risk and variability in
    returns to attempt to achieve a higher level of long-term
    returns. As a result, the company’s strategy targets a mix
    of investments that include 70% stocks (including a mix of large
    capitalization U.S. stocks, small- to mid-capitalization
    U.S. stocks and international stocks) and 30% fixed income
    investments and cash equivalents.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net
    earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common
    stock outstanding for each respective year. Diluted earnings per
    share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
    those respective years adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock
    options outstanding using the treasury stock method.

A reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the
    basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Prior to July 3, 2005, SYSCO accounted for its stock option
    plans and its Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan using the
    intrinsic value method of accounting provided under APB Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” (APB 25) and related interpretations, as
    permitted by FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation,” (SFAS 123) under which
    no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants
    and issuances of stock pursuant to the Employees’ Stock
    Purchase Plan. However, share-based compensation expense was
    recognized in periods prior to fiscal 2006 (and continues to be
    recognized) for stock issuances pursuant to the Management
    Incentive Plan and stock grants to non-employee directors.
    Share-based compensation was a pro forma disclosure in the
    financial statement footnotes and continues to be provided for
    periods prior to fiscal 2006.



Effective July 3, 2005, SYSCO adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS 123(R)) using the
    modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition
    method, compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 and later
    years includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted through July 2, 2005, but for which the
    requisite service period had not been completed as of the
    beginning of the fiscal year, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted during the fiscal year, based on the grant date
    fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS 123(R). Results for prior periods were not restated.

The adoption of SFAS 123(R) results in lower diluted shares
    outstanding than would have been calculated had compensation
    cost not been recorded for stock options and stock issuances
    under the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan. This is due to a
    modification required by SFAS 123(R) of the treasury stock
    method calculation utilized to compute the dilutive effect of
    stock options.

SYSCO provides compensation benefits to employees and
    non-employee directors under several share-based payment
    arrangements including various employee stock option plans, the
    Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive
    Plan and various non-employee director plans.

Stock
    Incentive Plans

SYSCO’s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan was adopted in fiscal
    2008 and provides for the issuance of up to
    30,000,000 shares of SYSCO common stock for share-based
    awards to officers and other employees of the company and its
    subsidiaries at the fair market value (as defined in the plan)
    of SYSCO common stock at the date of grant. Of the
    30,000,000 shares authorized under the 2007 Stock Incentive
    Plan, up to 25,000,000 shares may be issued as options or
    stock appreciation rights and up to 5,000,000 shares may be
    issued as restricted stock, restricted stock units or other
    types of stock-based awards. To date, SYSCO has only issued
    options under this plan. Vesting requirements for awards under
    this plan will vary by individual grant and may include either
    time-based vesting or time-based vesting subject to acceleration
    based on performance criteria for fiscal periods of at least one
    year. The contractual life of all options granted under this
    plan will be no greater than seven years. As of June 28,
    2008, there were 23,666,732 remaining shares authorized and
    available for grant in total under the 2007 Stock Incentive
    Plan, 18,666,732 shares that may be issued as options or
    stock appreciation rights and 5,000,000 shares that may be
    issued as restricted stock, restricted stock units or other
    types of stock-based awards.

SYSCO has also granted employee options under several previous
    employee stock option plans for which previously granted options
    remain outstanding as of June 28, 2008. No new options will
    be issued under any of the prior plans, as future grants to
    employees will be made through the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan or
    subsequently adopted plans. Vesting requirements for awards
    under these plans vary by individual grant and include either
    time-based vesting or time-based vesting subject to acceleration
    based on performance criteria. The contractual life of all
    options granted under these plans through July 3, 2004 is
    10 years; options granted after July 3, 2004 have a
    contractual life of seven years.

SYSCO’s 2005 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan was adopted
    in fiscal 2006 and provides for the issuance of up to
    550,000 shares of SYSCO common stock for share-based awards
    to non-employee directors. Of the 550,000 shares authorized
    under the 2005 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan, up to
    220,000 shares may be issued as options, up to
    320,000 shares may be issued as stock grants or restricted
    stock units and up to 10,000 shares may be issued as
    dividend equivalents. In addition, options and unvested common
    shares also remained outstanding as of June 28, 2008 under
    previous non-employee director stock plans. No further grants
    will be made under these previous plans, as all future grants to
    non-employee directors will be made through the 2005
    Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan or subsequently adopted plans.
    Vesting requirements for awards under these plans vary by
    individual grant and include either time-based vesting or
    vesting based on performance criteria. The contractual life of
    all options granted under these plans through July 3, 2004
    is 10 years; options granted after July 3, 2004 have a
    contractual life of seven years. As of June 28, 2008, there
    were 337,442 remaining shares authorized and available for grant
    in total under the 2005 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan,
    153,500 shares that may be issued as options,
    173,942 shares that may be issued as stock grants or
    restricted stock units and 10,000 shares that may be issued
    as dividend equivalents.

Stock
    Options

Certain of SYSCO’s option awards are subject to graded
    vesting over a service period. In those cases, SYSCO recognizes
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. In other cases, certain of
    SYSCO’s option awards provide for graded vesting over a
    service period but include a performance-based provision
    allowing for accelerated vesting. In these cases, if it is
    probable that the performance condition will be met, SYSCO
    recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the
    shorter performance period; otherwise, it will recognize
    compensation cost over the longer service period.

In addition, certain of SYSCO’s options provide that the
    options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an
    employee or director if the optionee meets certain age and years
    of service thresholds upon retirement. In these cases, for
    awards granted through July 2, 2005, SYSCO will recognize
    the compensation cost for such awards over the service period
    and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when
    the employee retires. Due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R),
    for awards granted subsequent to July 2, 2005, SYSCO will
    recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from
    the grant date to the date the employee or director first
    becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest
    after retirement. If SYSCO had recognized compensation cost for
    such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the
    employee or the director first became eligible to retire with
    the options continuing to vest after retirement for all periods
    presented, recognized compensation cost would have been
    $8,307,000, $11,698,000 and $23,907,000 lower for fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.



The fair value of each option award is estimated as of the date
    of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    weighted average assumptions for the periods indicated are noted
    in the following table. Expected volatility is based on
    historical volatility of SYSCO’s stock, implied
    volatilities from traded options on SYSCO’s stock and other
    factors. SYSCO utilizes historical data to estimate option
    exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation
    model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical
    exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation
    purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based on the
    historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for
    the year preceding the option grant. The risk-free rate for the
    expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury
    yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The following
    weighted-average assumptions were used for each fiscal year
    presented:

The total number of employee options granted was 6,438,968,
    6,504,200 and 4,826,500 in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. During fiscal 2008, 699,000 options were granted
    to 12 executive officers and 5,739,968 options were granted to
    approximately 1,500 other key employees. During fiscal 2007,
    594,000 options were granted to 9 executive officers and
    5,910,200 options were granted to approximately 1,600 other key
    employees. During fiscal 2006, 876,000 options were granted to
    17 executive officers and 3,950,500 options were granted to
    approximately 1,200 other key employees.

The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted in
    fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6.50, $6.85 and $7.83,
    respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
    during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, was $33,601,000, $73,124,000
    and $48,928,000, respectively.

Employees’
    Stock Purchase Plan

SYSCO has an Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan that permits
    employees to invest in SYSCO common stock by means of periodic
    payroll deductions at 85% of the closing price on the last
    business day of each calendar quarter. In November 2007, the
    Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan was amended to reserve an
    additional 6,000,000 shares of SYSCO common stock for
    issuance under the plan. Including the additional
    6,000,000 shares reserved in fiscal 2008, the total number
    of shares which may be sold pursuant to the plan may not exceed
    74,000,000 shares, of which 7,416,677 remained available as
    of June 28, 2008.

During fiscal 2008, 1,769,421 shares of SYSCO common stock
    were purchased by the participants as compared to
    1,708,250 shares purchased in fiscal 2007 and
    1,840,764 shares purchased in fiscal 2006. In July 2008,
    495,245 shares were purchased by participants.

The weighted average fair value of employee stock purchase
    rights issued pursuant to the Employees’ Stock Purchase
    Plan was $4.81, $5.02 and $4.88 per share during fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The fair value of the stock
    purchase rights was calculated as the difference between the
    stock price at date of issuance and the employee purchase price.

Management
    Incentive Compensation

SYSCO’s Management Incentive Plan compensates key
    management personnel for specific performance achievements. With
    respect to bonuses for fiscal 2008 and earlier years, the
    bonuses earned and expensed under this plan were paid in the
    following fiscal year in both cash and stock or deferred for
    payment in future years at the election of each participant. The
    stock awards under this plan immediately vest upon issuance;
    however, participants are restricted from selling, transferring,
    giving or otherwise conveying the shares for a period of two
    years from the date of issuance of such shares. The fair value
    of the stock issued under the Management Incentive Plan is based
    on the stock price less a 12% discount for post-vesting
    restrictions. The discount for post-vesting restrictions is
    estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating
    the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the
    restriction period.

A total of 588,143 shares, 323,822 shares and
    617,637 shares at a fair value of $32.99, $30.56 and
    $36.25, respectively, were issued pursuant to this plan in
    fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for bonuses earned in
    the preceding fiscal years. As of June 28, 2008, there were
    2,211,857 remaining shares that may be issued under the
    Management Incentive Plan. In August 2008, 672,087 shares
    were issued in payment of the stock



portion of the bonuses earned in fiscal 2008. In May 2008, the
    Management Incentive Plan was amended to remove the stock
    component of the bonus structure. Therefore, there will be no
    stock award component for the fiscal 2009 bonuses under this
    plan.

Non-Employee
    Director Stock Grants

Prior to fiscal 2008, one-time retainer awards were granted to
    newly elected directors under the 2005 Non-Employee Directors
    Stock Plan. These awards were of 6,000 shares of SYSCO
    common stock that vest one-third every year over a three-year
    period. In fiscal 2007, 12,000 shares in the aggregate of
    restricted stock were granted to two non-employee directors as
    one-time retainer awards under the 2005 Non-Employee Directors
    Stock Plan. There were no one-time retainer awards issued in
    fiscal 2006. The 2005

Non-Employee

Directors Stock Plan was amended during fiscal 2008 to
    discontinue the issuance of one-time retainer awards under the
    plan.

In addition, there are one-time retainer awards outstanding
    under the Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan, which was replaced
    by the 2005 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan. The remaining
    outstanding unvested awards under this plan vest over a six-year
    period if certain earnings goals are met.

The 2005 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan provides for the
    issuance of restricted stock to current non-employee directors.
    During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, 52,430, 30,000 and
    27,000 shares, respectively, of restricted stock were
    granted to non-employee directors. These shares will vest
    ratably over a three-year period.

The total amount of unvested shares related to the one-time
    retainer awards and other restricted stock awards as of
    June 28, 2008 was not significant.

Non-employee directors may also elect to receive up to 50% of
    their annual directors’ fees in SYSCO common stock. SYSCO
    provides a matching grant of 50% of the number of shares
    received for the stock election. As a result of such elections,
    a total of 13,051, 11,721 and 12,907 shares with a
    weighted-average grant date fair value of $33.33, $33.80 and
    $33.63 per share were issued in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively

All
    Share-Based Payment Arrangements

The total share-based compensation cost that has been recognized
    in results of operations was $80,650,000, $97,985,000, and
    $126,837,000 for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
    is included within operating expenses in the consolidated
    results of operations. The total income tax benefit recognized
    in results of operations for share-based compensation
    arrangements was $15,722,000, $21,549,000, and $15,607,000 for
    fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

As of June 28, 2008, there was $66,432,000 of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based
    compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.88 years.

Cash received from option exercises was $88,443,000,
    $172,734,000 and $93,337,000 during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax
    deductions from option exercises totaled $9,371,000,
    $22,575,000, and $12,507,000 during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Included in the income taxes charged to earnings are net
    deferred tax provisions of $642,357,000, $566,334,000, and
    $533,108,000 in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net changes
    during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities arising
    from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
    assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
    amounts used for income tax purposes. In addition to the
    deferred tax provision, changes in the deferred tax liability
    balances in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 were also impacted by the
    reclassification of deferred supply chain distributions from
    current deferred tax liabilities to accrued income taxes based
    on the timing of when payments related to these items become
    payable. These reclassifications were $575,248,000 and
    $536,492,000 in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Deferred
    supply chain distributions are classified as current or deferred
    tax liabilities based on when the related income tax payments
    will become payable.

The company had State and Canadian net operating tax losses as
    of June 28, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively. The
    net operating tax losses outstanding as of June 28, 2008
    expire in fiscal years 2009 through 2028. A valuation allowance
    of $39,020,000 and $70,935,000 was recorded as of June 28,
    2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively, as management
    believes that it is more likely than not that a portion of the
    benefits of these state and Canadian tax loss carryforwards will
    not be realized. Both the net operating tax loss carryforwards
    and the valuation allowances were impacted by the company’s
    adoption of FIN 48 by a reduction of $14,705,000 at the
    date of adoption on July 1, 2008.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by
    tax benefits of approximately $7,700,000 resulting from the
    recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which
    arose due to a state tax law change, $8,600,000 related to the
    reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on Canadian
    net operating loss deferred tax assets and $5,500,000 related to
    the reduction in net Canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a
    federal tax rate reduction. The effective tax rate for fiscal
    2008 was negatively impacted by the recording of tax and
    interest related to uncertain tax positions, share-based
    compensation expense and the recognition of losses to adjust the
    carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to
    their cash surrender values.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 decreased as compared to
    fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower share-based compensation
    expense in fiscal 2007 and increased gains recorded related to
    the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance
    policies.

SYSCO’s option grants include options that qualify as
    incentive stock options for income tax purposes. The treatment
    of the potential tax deduction, if any, related to incentive
    stock may cause variability in the company’s effective tax
    rate. In the period the compensation cost related to incentive
    stock options is recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not
    recorded as it is assumed that the company will not receive a
    tax deduction related to such incentive stock options. The
    company may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods
    to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the
    incentive stock option. In such cases, the company would record
    a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to
    exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded
    in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied
    by the statutory tax rate.

SYSCO recorded a tax benefit of $15,722,000 or 19.5% of the
    $80,650,000 in share-based compensation expense recorded in
    fiscal 2008. SYSCO recorded a tax benefit of $21,549,000 or
    22.0% of the $97,985,000 in share-based compensation expense
    recorded in fiscal 2007. SYSCO recorded a tax benefit of
    $15,607,000 or 12.3% of the $126,837,000 in share-based
    compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2006.

FIN 48

Prior to fiscal 2008, in evaluating the exposures connected with
    the various tax filing positions, the company established an
    accrual when, despite management’s belief that the
    company’s tax return positions are supportable, management
    believed that certain positions may be successfully challenged
    and a loss was probable. When facts and circumstances changed,
    these accruals were adjusted.



As discussed in Note 2, Changes in Accounting, the company
    adopted FIN 48 effective July 1, 2007. FIN 48
    provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may
    be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the
    largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
    likelihood of being realized upon settlement. As a result of
    this adoption, the company recognized, as a cumulative effect of
    change in accounting principle, a $91,635,000 decrease in its
    beginning retained earnings on its July 1, 2007 balance
    sheet. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and
    penalties, is as follows:


Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year

$

82,639,000

Additions for tax positions related to prior years

Reductions for tax positions related to prior years

)

Reductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations

(2,261,000

)

Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year

$

87,929,000

As of June 28, 2008, the gross amount of accrued interest
    liabilities was $138,207,000 related to unrecognized tax
    benefits and recorded interest expense of $12,287,000 in fiscal
    2008. The company does not have any accrued liabilities for
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and did not
    record any expense related to penalties in fiscal 2008. To the
    extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing
    authorities on any underpayment of income tax, estimated amounts
    required under FIN 48 have been accrued and are classified
    as a component of income taxes in the consolidated results of
    operations. This was the company’s accounting policy prior
    to the adoption of FIN 48, and SYSCO elected to continue
    this accounting policy post-adoption.

If SYSCO were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits
    recorded as of June 28, 2008, approximately $57,503,000 of
    the $87,929,000 reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. It
    is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax
    benefits with respect to certain of the company’s
    unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease in the next
    twelve months either because SYSCO agrees with positions that
    are sustained on audit or because the company agrees to their
    disallowance. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax
    benefits primarily include the consideration of various filing
    requirements in various states and the allocation of income and
    expense between tax jurisdictions. At this time, an estimate of
    the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.

SYSCO is currently in the appeals process as it relates to
    certain adjustments from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in
    relation to its audit of the company’s 2003 and 2004
    federal income tax returns. See further discussion in
    Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, under the caption
    “BSCC Cooperative Structure.” The IRS is also auditing
    SYSCO’s 2005 and 2006 federal income tax returns. As of
    June 28, 2008, SYSCO’s tax returns in the majority of
    the state and local jurisdictions and Canada are no longer
    subject to audit for the years before 2004. However, some
    jurisdictions have audits open prior to 2004, with the earliest
    dating back to 1996. Although the outcome of tax audits is
    generally uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts
    of tax, including interest and penalties, have been accrued for
    any adjustments that may result from those years.

Other

The company intends to permanently reinvest the undistributed
    earnings of its Canadian subsidiaries in those businesses
    outside of the United States and, therefore, has not provided
    for U.S. deferred income taxes on such undistributed
    foreign earnings. The determination of the amount of the
    unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed
    earnings is not practicable.

The determination of the company’s provision for income
    taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and
    the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The
    company’s provision for income taxes reflects a combination
    of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and
    state, as well as Canadian federal and provincial,
    jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or
    decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items,
    accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or
    valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix
    of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the
    overall effective tax rate.

17.

ACQUISITIONS

During fiscal 2008, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of
    $55,259,000 for operations acquired during fiscal 2008 and for
    contingent consideration related to operations acquired in
    previous fiscal years. The acquisitions were immaterial,
    individually and in the aggregate, to the consolidated financial
    statements. In addition, escrowed funds in the amount of
    $7,000,000 related to certain acquisitions were released to
    sellers of previously acquired businesses during fiscal 2008.

Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically
    payable only in the event that certain operating results are
    attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved.
    Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of
    June 28, 2008 included $55,469,000 in cash, which, if
    distributed, could result in the recording of additional
    goodwill. Such amounts are to be paid out over periods of up to
    four years from the date of acquisition if the contingent
    criteria are met.



18.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

SYSCO is engaged in various legal proceedings which have arisen
    but have not been fully adjudicated. These proceedings, in the
    opinion of management, will not have a material adverse effect
    upon the consolidated financial position or results of
    operations of the company when ultimately concluded.

Product
    Liability Claim

In October 2007, an arbitration judgment against the company was
    issued related to a product liability claim from one of
    SYSCO’s former customers, which formalized a preliminary
    award by the arbitrator in July 2007. As of the year ended
    June 30, 2007, the company had recorded $50,296,000 on its
    consolidated balance sheet within accrued expenses related to
    the accrual of this loss and a corresponding receivable of
    $48,296,000 within prepaid expenses and other current assets,
    which represented the estimate of the loss less the $2,000,000
    deductible on SYSCO’s insurance policy, as the company
    anticipated recovery from various parties. In December 2007, the
    company paid its deductible on its insurance policy and made
    arrangements with its insurance carrier and other parties who
    paid the remaining amount of the judgment in excess of the
    company’s deductible. The company no longer has any
    remaining contingent liabilities related to this claim.

Multi-Employer
    Pension Plans

SYSCO contributes to several multi-employer defined benefit
    pension plans based on obligations arising under collective
    bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees.
    Approximately 12% of SYSCO’s current employees are
    participants in such multi-employer plans. In fiscal 2008, total
    contributions to these plans were approximately $35,040,000.

SYSCO does not directly manage these multi-employer plans, which
    are generally managed by boards of trustees, half of whom are
    appointed by the unions and the other half by other employers
    contributing to the plan. Based upon the information available
    from plan administrators, management believes that several of
    these multi-employer plans are underfunded. In addition, the
    Pension Protection Act, enacted in August 2006, requires
    underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within
    prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding.
    As a result, SYSCO expects its contributions to these plans to
    increase in the future.

Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, SYSCO’s voluntary
    withdrawal, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers
    from any underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would
    require SYSCO to make payments to the plan for SYSCO’s
    proportionate share of the multi-employer plan’s unfunded
    vested liabilities. Based on the information available from plan
    administrators, SYSCO estimates that its share of withdrawal
    liability on most of the multi-employer plans it participates in
    could be as much as $140,000,000 based on a voluntary
    withdrawal. In addition, if a multi-employer defined benefit
    plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the
    IRS may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of
    the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers
    contributing to the fund. Of the plans in which SYSCO
    participates, one plan is more critically underfunded than the
    others. During fiscal 2008, the company obtained information
    that this plan failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements
    for certain periods and believes it is probable that additional
    funding will be required as well as the payment of excise tax.
    As a result, SYSCO recorded a liability of approximately
    $16,500,000 related to our share of the minimum funding
    requirements and related excise tax for these periods.
    Currently, the company believes that a majority of this amount
    will be paid in fiscal 2009 and SYSCO is continuing to explore
    its alternatives as it relates to this plan. As of June 28,
    2008, SYSCO has approximately $22,000,000 in liabilities
    recorded in total related to certain underfunded multi-employer
    defined benefit plans.

BSCC
    Cooperative Structure

SYSCO’s affiliate, Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative (BSCC),
    is a cooperative taxed under subchapter T of the United States
    Internal Revenue Code. SYSCO believes that the deferred tax
    liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal
    ownership of BSCC are appropriate under the tax laws. However,
    if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure
    of BSCC were to be successfully challenged by any federal, state
    or local tax authority, SYSCO could be required to accelerate
    the payment of all or a portion of its income tax liabilities
    associated with BSCC that it otherwise has deferred until future
    periods. In that event, SYSCO would be liable for interest on
    such amounts. As of June 28, 2008, SYSCO has recorded
    deferred income tax liabilities of $1,054,190,000, net of
    federal benefit, related to the BSCC supply chain distributions.
    If the IRS and any other relevant taxing authorities determine
    that all amounts since the inception of BSCC were
    inappropriately deferred, and the determination is upheld, SYSCO
    estimates that in addition to making a current payment for
    amounts previously deferred, as discussed above, the company may
    be required to pay interest on the cumulative deferred balances.
    These interest amounts could range from $290,000,000 to
    $320,000,000, prior to federal and state income tax benefit, as
    of June 28, 2008. SYSCO calculated this amount based upon
    the amounts deferred since the inception of BSCC applying the
    applicable jurisdictions’ interest rates in effect in each
    period. The IRS, in connection with its audit of the
    company’s 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns,
    proposed adjustments related to the taxability of the
    cooperative structure. The company is vigorously protesting
    these adjustments. The company has reviewed the merits of the
    issues raised by the IRS, and, while management believes it is
    probable the company will prevail, the company concluded the
    measurement model of FIN 48 (adopted in fiscal
    2008) required an accrual for a portion of the interest
    exposure.



Fuel
    Commitments

From time to time, SYSCO may enter into forward purchase
    commitments for a portion of its projected diesel fuel
    requirements. There were no amounts outstanding as of
    June 28, 2008, however in July and August 2008, SYSCO
    entered into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments total
    approximately $195,000,000 at a fixed price through the end of
    July 2009.

Other
    Commitments

SYSCO has committed to product purchases for resale in order to
    leverage the company’s purchasing power. A majority of
    these agreements expire within one year, however certain
    agreements have terms through fiscal 2012. These agreements
    commit the company to a minimum volume at various pricing terms,
    including fixed pricing, variable pricing or a combination
    thereof. Minimum amounts committed to as of June 28, 2008
    totaled approximately $1,335,561,000.

SYSCO has committed with a third party service provider to
    provide hardware and hardware hosting services. The services are
    to be provided over a ten year period beginning in fiscal 2005
    and ending in fiscal 2015. The total cost of the services over
    that period is expected to be approximately $500,000,000. This
    amount may be reduced by SYSCO utilizing less than estimated
    resources and can be increased by SYSCO utilizing more than
    estimated resources and the adjustments for inflation provided
    for in the agreements. SYSCO may also cancel a portion or all of
    the services provided subject to termination fees which decrease
    over time. Although it does not expect to, if SYSCO were to
    terminate all of the services in fiscal 2009, the estimated
    termination fee incurred in fiscal 2009 would be approximately
    $11,500,000. SYSCO believes that these agreements will provide a
    more secure and reliable environment for its data processing as
    well as reduce overall operating costs over the ten year period.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENT INFORMATION

The company has aggregated its operating companies into a number
    of segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable
    segments as defined in SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
    about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”
    Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food
    products and a wide variety of non-food products to both
    traditional and chain restaurant customers. SYGMA operating
    companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide
    variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant
    customer locations. “Other” financial information is
    attributable to the company’s other operating segments,
    including the company’s specialty produce, custom-cut meat
    and lodging industry segments and a company that distributes to
    international customers.

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those
    disclosed by SYSCO. Intersegment sales represent specialty
    produce and meat company products distributed by the Broadline
    and SYGMA operating companies. The segment results include
    certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are
    charged to our segments. These centrally incurred costs are
    charged based upon the relative level of service used by each
    operating company consistent with how SYSCO’s management
    views the performance of its operating segments. Prior to fiscal
    2008, SYSCO’s management evaluated performance of each of
    its operating segments based on its respective earnings before
    income taxes. This measure included an allocation of certain
    corporate expenses to each operating segment in addition to the
    centrally incurred costs for shared services that were charged
    to its segments. During fiscal 2008, SYSCO’s management
    increased its focus on the results of each of its operating
    segments based on its respective operating income performance
    which excludes the allocation of additional corporate expenses.
    As a result, the segment reporting for fiscal 2007 and 2006 has
    been revised to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation.

Included in corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments,
    among other items, are:

•

Gains and losses recognized to adjust corporate-owned life
    insurance policies to their cash surrender values;

•

Share-based compensation expense related to stock option grants,
    issuances of stock pursuant to the Employees’ Stock
    Purchase Plan and stock grants to non-employee
    directors; and

•

Corporate-level depreciation and amortization expense.

SUPPLEMENTAL
    GUARANTOR INFORMATION

SYSCO International, Co. is an unlimited liability company
    organized under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada
    and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SYSCO. In May 2002, SYSCO
    International, Co. issued, in a private offering, $200,000,000
    of 6.10% notes due in 2012 (see Note 10, Debt). In
    December 2002, these notes were exchanged for substantially
    identical notes in an exchange offer registered under the
    Securities Act of 1933. These notes are fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed by SYSCO. SYSCO International, Co. is
    a holding company with no significant sources of income or
    assets, other than its equity interests in its subsidiaries and
    interest income from loans made to its subsidiaries. The
    proceeds from the issuance of the 6.10% notes were used to
    repay commercial paper issued to fund the fiscal 2002
    acquisition of a Canadian broadline foodservice operation.

The following condensed consolidating financial statements
    present separately the financial position, results of operations
    and cash flows of the parent guarantor (SYSCO), the subsidiary
    issuer (SYSCO International) and all other non-guarantor

Financial results are impacted by accounting changes and the

Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

SYSCO’s management, with the participation of our chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    June 28, 2008. The term “disclosure controls and
    procedures,” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
    company that are designed to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
    the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    company’s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding the required disclosure. Management
    recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
    achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies
    its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
    possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures as of June 28, 2008, our
    chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
    that, as of such date, SYSCO’s disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting is included in the financial statement pages at
    page 31.

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
    June 28, 2008 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.
