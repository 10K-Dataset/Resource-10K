Overview

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and
    divisions, is the largest North American distributor of food and
    related products primarily to the foodservice or
    food-away-from-home industry. We provide products and related
    services to approximately 400,000 customers, including
    restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging
    establishments and other foodservice customers.

Founded in 1969, Sysco commenced operations as a public company
    in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged
    their stock for Sysco common stock. Since our formation, we have
    grown from $115.0 million to $39.3 billion in annual
    sales, both through internal expansion of existing operations
    and through acquisitions.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June
    30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ending July 2, 2011
    for fiscal 2011, a 53-week year ending July 3, 2010 for
    fiscal 2010 and a 52-week year ending June 27, 2009 for
    2009.

Sysco Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. The
    address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390
    Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas

77077-2099,

(281) 584-1390.

Operating
    Segments

Sysco provides food and related products to the foodservice or
    food-away-from-home industry. Under the accounting provisions
    related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have
    aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments, of
    which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable segments as
    defined by accounting standards. Broadline operating companies
    distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of
    non-food products to their customers. SYGMA operating companies
    distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of
    non-food products to chain restaurant customer locations. Our
    other segments include our specialty produce and lodging
    industry products segments and a company that distributes to
    international customers. Specialty produce companies distribute
    fresh produce and, on a limited basis, other foodservice
    products. Our lodging industry products company distributes
    personal care guest amenities, equipment, housekeeping supplies,
    room accessories and textiles to the lodging industry. Selected
    financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as
    financial information concerning geographic areas can be found
    in Note 19, “Business Segment Information,” in
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Customers and
    Products

Sysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include
    restaurants, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and
    other similar venues where foodservice products are served.
    Services to our customers are supported by similar physical
    facilities, vehicles, material handling equipment and
    techniques, and administrative and operating staffs.

The products we distribute include:

•

a full line of frozen foods, such as meats, fully prepared
    entrees, fruits, vegetables and desserts;

•

a full line of canned and dry foods;

•

fresh meats;

•

dairy products;

•

beverage products;

•

imported specialties; and

•

fresh produce.

We also supply a wide variety of non-food items, including:

•

paper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups;

•

tableware such as china and silverware;

•

cookware such as pots, pans and utensils;

•

restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and

•

cleaning supplies.

Sales are less than 1% of total

Our operating companies distribute nationally-branded
    merchandise, as well as products packaged under our private
    brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been
    manufactured for Sysco according to specifications that have
    been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our
    quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and
    processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces
    our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that
    satisfy our requirements.

We believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders,
    competitive pricing, close contact with customers and the
    ability to provide a full array of products and services to
    assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary
    importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice
    products to our customers. Our operating companies offer daily
    delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability
    of delivering special orders on short notice. Through our
    approximately 13,500 sales and marketing representatives and
    support staff of Sysco and our operating companies, we stay
    informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with
    new products and services. Our operating companies also provide
    ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution, such as
    providing customers with product usage reports and other data,
    menu-planning advice, food safety training and assistance in
    inventory control, as well as access to various third party
    services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of Sysco’s
    total sales for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2011.

Based upon available information, we estimate that sales by type
    of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Sources of
    Supply

We purchase from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and
    international, none of which individually accounts for more than
    10% of our purchases. These suppliers consist generally of large
    corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise,
    as well as independent regional brand and private label
    processors and packers. Purchasing is generally carried out
    through both centrally developed purchasing programs and direct
    purchasing programs established by our various operating
    companies.

We administer a consolidated product procurement program
    designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food
    and non-food products. The program covers the purchasing and
    marketing of Sysco Brand merchandise as well as products from a
    number of national brand suppliers, encompassing substantially
    all product lines. Sysco’s operating companies purchase
    product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated
    programs and from other suppliers, although Sysco Brand products
    are only available to the operating companies through these
    consolidated programs. We also focus on increasing profitability
    by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory
    levels, which reduces future facility expansion needs at our
    broadline operating companies, while providing greater value to
    our suppliers and customers. This includes the construction and
    operation of regional distribution centers (RDCs), which
    aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain
    activities for certain products for all Sysco broadline
    operating companies in the region. Currently, we have two RDCs
    in operation in Virginia and Florida and will begin construction
    on a third RDC in fiscal 2012 in Indiana.

Working Capital
    Practices

Our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from
    operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings.
    See the discussion in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
    Liquidity and Capital Resources” at Item 7 regarding
    our liquidity, financial position and sources and uses of funds.



Credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on
    delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each
    customer’s credit worthiness. We monitor each
    customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary.

A majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours
    of when customer orders are placed. We generally maintain
    inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand. The level
    of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on
    shelf-life, supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer
    demand. We also make purchases of additional volumes of certain
    products based on supply or pricing opportunities.

We take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where
    appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from
    our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more.

Corporate
    Headquarters And Shared Services Center

Our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our
    operating companies. Members of the corporate staff possess
    experience and expertise in, among other areas, accounting and
    finance, treasury, legal, cash management, information
    technology, employee benefits, engineering, real estate and
    construction, risk management and insurance, sales and
    marketing, payroll, human resources, training and development,
    strategy, and tax compliance services. The corporate office also
    makes available warehousing and distribution services, which
    provide assistance in operational best practices including space
    utilization, energy conservation, fleet management and work flow.

We are in the early stages of implementing a shared services
    center that will perform support services for employees,
    suppliers and customers, payroll administration, human
    resources, customer and vendor contract administration,
    financial services such as vendor payments, invoicing, cash
    application, certain credit services, accounting and sales and
    use tax administration, procurement and maintenance support and
    sales support for our operating companies.

Capital
    Improvements

To maximize productivity and customer service, we continue to
    modernize, expand and construct new distribution facilities.
    During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately
    $636.4 million, $594.6 million and $464.6 million
    respectively, were invested in technology, facilities, delivery
    fleet and other capital asset enhancements. We estimate our
    capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 should be in the range of
    $750 million to $800 million. During the three years
    ended July 2, 2011, capital expenditures were financed
    primarily by internally generated funds, our commercial paper
    program and bank and other borrowings. We expect to finance our
    fiscal 2012 capital expenditures from the same sources.

We are undertaking a multi-year Business Transformation Project,
    pursuant to which we are developing and implementing an
    integrated software system to support a majority of our
    businesses and further streamline our operations. These systems
    are commonly referred to as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
    systems. Approximately $100 million to $120 million of
    the fiscal 2012 estimated capital expenditures are related to
    the Business Transformation Project.

Employees

As of July 2, 2011, we had approximately
    46,000 full-time employees, approximately 17% of whom were
    represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood
    of Teamsters. Contract negotiations are handled by each
    individual operating company. Approximately 25% of our union
    employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which
    have expired or will expire during fiscal 2012 and are subject
    to renegotiation. Since July 2, 2011, two contracts
    covering 85 of such employees have been renegotiated. We
    consider our labor relations to be satisfactory.

Competition

Industry sources estimate that there are more than
    15,000 companies engaged in foodservice distribution in the
    United States. Our customers may also choose to purchase
    products directly from retail outlets or negotiate prices
    directly with our suppliers. While we compete primarily with
    local and regional distributors, a few organizations compete
    with us on a national basis. We believe that the principal
    competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective
    customer contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of
    quality products and related services on a timely and dependable
    basis and competitive prices. An additional competitive factor
    for our larger chain restaurant customers is the ability to
    provide a national distribution network. We consider our primary
    market to be the foodservice market in the United States and
    Canada and estimate that we serve about 17% of this
    approximately $220 billion annual market. We believe, based
    upon industry trade data, that our sales to the United States
    and Canada food-away-from-home industry were the highest of any
    foodservice distributor during fiscal 2011. While adequate
    industry statistics are not available, we believe that in most
    instances our local operations are among the leading
    distributors of food and related non-food products to
    foodservice customers in their respective trading areas. We
    believe our competitive advantages include our more than 8,000
    marketing associates, our diversified product base, which
    includes a differentiated group of high quality Sysco brand
    products, the diversity in the types of customers we serve, our
    economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the
    United States and Canada, which mitigates some of the impact of
    regional economic declines that may occur over time and provides
    a national distribution network for larger chain restaurant
    customers. We believe our liquidity and access to capital
    provides us the ability to continuously invest in business
    improvements. We are the only publicly-traded distributor in the
    food-away-from-home industry in the United States. While our
    public company status provides us with some advantages,
    including access to capital, we believe it also provides us with
    some disadvantages that our competitors do not have in terms of
    additional costs related to complying with regulatory
    requirements.



Government
    Regulation

As a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject
    to the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
    regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration (FDA), as well as the Canadian Food and
    Drugs Act and the regulations thereunder.

The FDA regulates food safety through various statutory and
    regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding
    requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice
    regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP)
    requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive
    approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of
    identity for certain foods, prescribes the format and content of
    information required to appear on food product labels, regulates
    food contact packaging and materials, and maintains a Reportable
    Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a
    reasonable probability that an article of food will cause
    serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines,
    we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the
    Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural
    Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations
    promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to
    interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA
    imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation
    through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The
    USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and
    also establishes standards for the grading and commercial
    acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also
    subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism
    Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain
    registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that
    manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal
    consumption.

In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency administers and
    enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards
    established by Health Canada under the Canadian Food and Drugs
    Act and under other related federal legislation, including the
    Canada Agricultural Products Act, the Meat Inspection Act, the
    Fish Inspection Act and the Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act
    (as it relates to food). These laws regulate the processing,
    storing, grading, packaging, marking, transporting and
    inspection of certain Sysco product lines as well as the
    packaging, labeling, sale, importation and advertising of
    pre-packaged and certain other products.

We and our products are also subject to state, provincial and
    local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our
    facilities; enforcement by state, provincial and local health
    agencies of state, provincial and local standards for our
    products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection
    with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to
    inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the
    U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the
    U.S. Department of Labor, together with similar
    occupational health and safety laws in each Canadian province.
    These regulations require us to comply with certain
    manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our
    employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication
    programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain
    chemicals present in products we distribute.

We are also subject to regulation by numerous U.S. and
    Canadian federal, state, provincial and local regulatory
    agencies, including, but not limited to, the
    U.S. Department of Labor and each Canadian provincial
    ministry of labour, which set employment practice standards for
    workers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation and the
    Canadian Transportation Agency, which regulate transportation of
    perishable and hazardous materials and waste, and similar state,
    provincial and local agencies.

Most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based
    refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel
    and other petroleum products which are subject to laws
    regulating such systems and storage tanks. Although we are
    subject to other U.S. and Canadian federal, state,
    provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of
    the environment or the discharge of materials, these provisions
    do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities.

Compliance with these laws has not had, and is not anticipated
    to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings
    or competitive position.

General

We have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance,
    including the
    SYSCO

®

trademark and our privately-branded product trademarks that
    include the
    SYSCO

®

trademark. These trademarks and the private brands on which they
    are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry.
    Approximately half of our privately-branded sales are from
    products labeled with our
    SYSCO

®

trademark without any other trademark. We believe the loss of
    the
    SYSCO

®

trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations. Our U.S. trademarks are effective for a ten
    year period and the company generally renews its trademarks
    before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is
    no longer in use. The company does not have any material patents
    or licenses.

We are not engaged in material research and development
    activities relating to the development of new products or the
    improvement of existing products.

Our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal
    basis; therefore, the business of the company is not deemed to
    be seasonal.

As of July 2, 2011, we operated 177 distribution facilities
    throughout the United States, Canada and Ireland.



Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Periods of
    Difficult Economic Conditions and Heightened Uncertainty in the
    Financial Markets Affect Consumer Confidence, which Can
    Adversely Impact our Business

The foodservice distribution industry is characterized by
    relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit
    margins and the foodservice industry is sensitive to national
    and regional economic conditions. Difficult economic conditions,
    such as the slow economic recovery experienced in fiscal 2011
    which included food and fuel cost inflation experienced by the
    consumer, and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets
    negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary
    spending. This can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining
    out and the amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home
    purchases. These conditions, in turn, can negatively impacted
    our sales. The development of worsening economic conditions in
    the future or permanent changes in consumer dining habits as a
    result of such conditions would likely negatively impact our
    operating results.

Periods of
    Significant or Prolonged Inflation or Deflation Affect our
    Product Costs and Profitability

Volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry.
    Periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on
    our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable
    to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to
    our customers, which may have a negative impact on our business
    and our profitability. In addition, product cost inflation may
    negatively impact consumer spending decisions, which could
    adversely impact our sales. Conversely, our business may be
    adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because
    we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are
    based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup.
    As a result, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during
    periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit
    percentage may remain relatively constant. Our estimate for the
    inflation in Sysco’s cost of goods was 4.6% in fiscal 2011,
    compared to deflation of 1.5% in fiscal 2010 and inflation of
    4.7% in fiscal 2009.

Our Business
    Transformation Project Could Experience Implementation Problems,
    Scheduling Delays or Cost Overages and May Not Prove to Be Cost
    Effective or Result in the Benefits We Anticipate, Negatively
    Impacting our Business, Results of Operations and
    Liquidity

In fiscal 2009, we commenced the design of an enterprise-wide
    project to implement an integrated software system, commonly
    referred to as an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, to
    support a majority of our business processes and further
    streamline our operations. We have substantially completed the
    design and build phases of our Business Transformation Project
    and we are testing the underlying ERP system and processes
    through a pilot implementation. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2011, our pilot operating company implemented the project
    and our shared services center became active in its support
    role. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming
    projects that involve substantial investments in system software
    and implementation activities over a multi-year timeframe. As is
    the case in most ERP implementations, we expect that the
    implementation of our ERP system will require transformation of
    business and financial processes in order to realize the full
    benefits of the project. Although we expect the investment in
    the Business Transformation Project to provide meaningful
    benefits to the company over the long-term, the costs will
    exceed the benefits during the testing and deployment stages of
    implementation, including fiscal 2012. The expected costs of the
    project in fiscal 2012 may be greater or less than
    currently expected because as we continue implementation of the
    project, we may encounter the need for changes in design or
    revisions of the project calendar and budget, including
    incurring expenses at an earlier or later time than currently
    anticipated. In fiscal 2011, we took more time to test the
    underlying ERP system and processes. We are also taking
    additional time in fiscal 2012 to improve the underlying systems
    prior to larger scale deployment. These actions have caused a
    delay in the project of approximately six to twelve months and
    until we reach the point where the underlying system functions
    as intended, our deployment timeline is still being determined.
    Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected
    if we experience operating problems, scheduling delays, cost
    overages or limitations on the extent of the business
    transformation during the ERP implementation process. In
    addition, because the implementation is expected to involve a
    significant capital commitment, our business, results of
    operations and liquidity may also be adversely affected if the
    ERP system, and the associated process changes, do not prove to
    be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other
    benefits that we anticipate.

We May Not Be
    Able to Fully Compensate for Increases in Fuel Costs

Volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry. The
    cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well
    as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our
    customers. Although we have been able to pass along a portion of
    increased fuel costs to our customers in the past, there is no
    guarantee that we can do so again if another period of high fuel
    costs occurs. If fuel costs increase again in the future, we may
    experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these
    costs along to our customers, which may have a negative impact
    on our business and our profitability. We routinely enter into
    forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected
    monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the
    then-current market price for diesel. If fuel prices decrease
    significantly, these forward purchases may prove ineffective and
    result in us paying higher than market costs for a portion of
    our diesel fuel.

Conditions Beyond
    our Control can Interrupt our Supplies and Increase our Product
    Costs

We obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related
    products from third party suppliers. For the most part, we do
    not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them
    to provide products to us. Although our purchasing volume can
    provide leverage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not
    provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in
    the quantities and at the prices requested. We are



also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and
    increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our
    control. These conditions include work slowdowns, work
    interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of
    suppliers, short-term weather conditions or more prolonged
    climate change, crop conditions, product recalls, water
    shortages, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel
    or increases in fuel costs, competitive demands and natural
    disasters or other catastrophic events (including, but not
    limited to food-borne illnesses). Our inability to obtain
    adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a
    result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean
    that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers, and
    customers may turn to other distributors.

If we Fail to
    Comply with Requirements Imposed by Applicable Law or Other
    Governmental Regulations, we Could Become Subject to Lawsuits,
    Investigations and Other Liabilities and Restrictions on our
    Operations that Could Significantly and Adversely Affect our
    Business

We are subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state,
    international, national, provincial and local levels in many
    areas of our business, such as food safety and sanitation,
    minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour and
    employment discrimination, immigration, human health and safety,
    including regulations of the FDA, USDA, U.S. Occupational
    Safety and Health Administration, federal motor carrier safety,
    data privacy, environmental protection, the import and export of
    goods and customs regulations, the False Claims Act, the Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act and the services we provide in connection
    with governmentally funded entitlement programs. From time to
    time, both federal and state governmental agencies have
    conducted audits of our billing practices as part of
    investigations of providers of services under governmental
    contracts, or otherwise. We also receive requests for
    information from governmental agencies in connection with these
    audits. While we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and
    regulations, we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance
    with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of
    these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able
    to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations
    of these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with
    applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with
    respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations,
    including those referred to above, we may be subject to
    investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including
    fines, injunctions, prohibitions on exporting, seizures or
    debarments from contracting with the government. The cost of
    compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including
    debarments, could have a material adverse effect on our business
    and results of operations. In addition, governmental units may
    make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we
    operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or
    individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in
    order to comply with such laws and regulations.

Adverse Publicity
    about us or Lack of Confidence in our Products Could Negatively
    Impact our Reputation and Reduce Earnings

Maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the
    safety of the products we distribute is critical to our
    business, particularly to selling Sysco Brand products. Anything
    that damages that reputation or the public’s confidence in
    our products, whether or not justified, including adverse
    publicity about the quality, safety or integrity of our
    products, could quickly affect our revenues and profits.
    Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses, such as

e-coli,

avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A,
    trichinosis or salmonella, and injuries caused by food tampering
    could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact
    the public’s confidence in our products. If patrons of our
    restaurant customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, our
    customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant
    locations and our sales and profitability would be
    correspondingly decreased. In addition, instances of food-borne
    illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns, such as
    flu epidemics or other pandemics, even those unrelated to the
    use of Sysco products, or public concern regarding the safety of
    our products, can result in negative publicity about the food
    service distribution industry and cause our sales and
    profitability to decrease dramatically.

Competition in
    our Industry may Adversely Impact our Margins and our Ability to
    Retain Customers

The foodservice industry is highly competitive and numerous
    regional and local competitors exist. Additionally, new
    competition could arise from non-traditional sources or
    consolidation among competitors. New competitive sources may
    result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price
    increases, or may require increased discounting. Such
    competition may result in margin erosion

and/or

make
    it difficult for us to attract and retain customers.

Increased competition within the industry and general economic
    conditions have served to further increase pressure on the
    industry’s profit margins, and continued margin pressure
    within the industry may have a material adverse impact on our
    operating results and profitability. If we are unable to
    effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our
    market share, sales and profitability, through increased
    expenditures or decreased prices, could be adversely impacted.

Product Liability
    Claims Could Materially Impact our Business

We, like any other seller of food, face the risk of exposure to
    product liability claims in the event that the use of products
    sold by Sysco causes injury or illness. With respect to product
    liability claims, we believe we have sufficient primary or
    excess umbrella liability insurance. However, this insurance may
    not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or, if
    available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities.
    We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance
    coverage from parties supplying our products, but this
    indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical
    matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and
    the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If
    Sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual
    indemnification available, product liability relating to
    defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and
    earnings per share.



Expanding into
    International Markets and Complimentary Lines of Business
    Presents Unique Challenges, and our Expansion Efforts with
    respect to International Operations and Complimentary Lines of
    Business may not be Successful

In addition to our domestic activities, an element of our
    strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of
    operations into international markets. Our ability to
    successfully operate in international markets may be adversely
    affected by local laws and customs, legal and regulatory
    constraints, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act, political and economic conditions and currency
    regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently
    operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in
    our existing and future international operations also include,
    among others, the costs and difficulties of managing
    international operations, difficulties in identifying and
    gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse
    tax consequences, maintaining product quality and greater
    difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.
    Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations
    may have an impact on our future costs or on future sales and
    cash flows from our international operations.

Another element of our strategy includes the possibility of
    expansion into businesses that are closely related or
    complimentary to, but not currently part of, our core
    foodservice distribution business. Our ability to successfully
    operate in these complimentary business markets may be adversely
    affected by legal and regulatory constraints, including
    compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject.
    Risks inherent in branching out into such complimentary markets
    also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations
    outside of our core business, which may require additional
    skills and competencies, as well as difficulties in identifying
    and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets.

We Must Finance
    and Integrate Acquired Businesses Effectively

Historically, a portion of our growth has come through
    acquisitions. If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses
    successfully or realize anticipated economic, operational and
    other benefits and synergies in a timely manner, our earnings
    per share may decrease. Integration of an acquired business may
    be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in
    which we have limited expertise, or with a culture different
    from Sysco’s. A significant expansion of our business and
    operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our
    administrative and operational resources. Significant
    acquisitions may also require the issuance of material
    additional amounts of debt or equity, which could materially
    alter our debt to equity ratio, increase our interest expense
    and decrease earnings per share, and make it difficult for us to
    obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital
    investments.

We Need Access to
    Borrowed Funds in Order to Grow and Any Default by Us Under our
    Indebtedness Could Have a Material Adverse Impact

A substantial part of our growth historically has been the
    result of acquisitions and capital expansion. We anticipate
    additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future. As
    a result, our inability to finance acquisitions and capital
    expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability
    to expand. Moreover, any default under the documents governing
    our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our
    cash flows, as well as the market value of our common stock.

Our Level of
    Indebtedness and the Terms of our Indebtedness Could Adversely
    Affect our Business and Liquidity Position

As of July 2, 2011, we had approximately $2.7 billion
    of total indebtedness. We have a Board-approved commercial paper
    program allowing us to issue short-term unsecured notes in an
    aggregate amount not to exceed $1.3 billion; a revolving
    credit facility supporting our U.S. and Canadian commercial
    paper programs in the amount of $1.0 billion set to expire
    on November 4, 2012; and certain uncommitted bank lines of
    credit providing for unsecured borrowings for working capital of
    up to $95.0 million. Our indebtedness may increase from
    time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in
    operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures
    and potential acquisitions or joint ventures. Prior to maturity
    of our revolving credit facility, we plan to renew or extend
    this credit facility. The amount of credit capacity we are able
    to obtain, if not sufficient for our needs, and the ultimate
    cost of such credit could have a negative impact on our
    liquidity, cost of capital and financial results. In addition,
    to the extent that we decrease the amount of capacity under our
    revolver when it is renewed, there is a risk that such liquidity
    levels may not be adequate in the future to the extent that our
    access to capital markets is restricted.

Technology
    Dependence Could have a Material Negative Impact on our
    Business

Our ability to decrease costs and increase profits, as well as
    our ability to serve customers most effectively, depends on the
    reliability of our technology network. We use software and other
    technology systems, among other things, to generate and select
    orders, to load and route trucks and to monitor and manage our
    business on a

day-to-day

basis. Any disruption to these computer systems could adversely
    impact our customer service, decrease the volume of our business
    and result in increased costs. Furthermore, process changes may
    be required as we continue to use our existing warehousing,
    delivery, and payroll systems to support operations as we
    implement the ERP system. While Sysco has invested and continues
    to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster
    recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from
    technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on
    operations and profits.

We may be
    Required to Pay Material Amounts Under Multi-Employer Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans

We contribute to several multi-employer defined benefit pension
    plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining
    agreements covering union-represented employees. Approximately
    10% of our current employees are participants in such
    multi-employer plans. In fiscal 2011, our total contributions to
    these plans were approximately $32.8 million.



We do not directly manage these multi-employer plans, which are
    generally managed by boards of trustees, half of whom are
    appointed by the unions and the other half by other contributing
    employers to the plan. Based upon the information available to
    us from plan administrators, we believe that several of these
    multi-employer plans are underfunded. In addition, the Pension
    Protection Act, enacted in August 2006, requires underfunded
    pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed
    intervals based on the level of their underfunding. As a result,
    we expect our required contributions to these plans to increase
    in the future.

Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, our voluntary withdrawal, or
    the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any
    underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would require us
    to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the
    multi-employer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. Based on
    the information currently available from plan administrators,
    which has valuation dates ranging from January 31, 2009 to
    December 31, 2009, Sysco estimates its share of the
    aggregate withdrawal liability on most of the multi-employer
    plans in which it participates could have been as much as
    $200.0 million as of July 2, 2011 based on a voluntary
    withdrawal. This estimate excludes plans for which Sysco has
    recorded withdrawal liabilities. The majority of the plans we
    participate in have a valuation date of calendar year-end. As
    such, the majority of our estimated withdrawal liability results
    from plans for which the valuation date was December 31,
    2009; therefore, our estimated liability reflects the effects of
    the fair value of the plans’ assets and projected benefit
    obligations as of that date. Due to the lack of current
    information, we believe our current share of the withdrawal
    liability could materially differ from this estimate. In
    addition, if a multi-employer defined benefit plan fails to
    satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) may impose a nondeductible excise tax of
    5% on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those
    employers contributing to the fund. As of July 2, 2011,
    Sysco had approximately $42.4 million in liabilities
    recorded in total related to certain multi-employer defined
    benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal has already
    occurred. If any of these plans were to undergo a mass
    withdrawal, as defined by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
    Corporation, within a two year time frame from the point of our
    withdrawal, we could have additional liability. Requirements to
    pay such increased contributions, withdrawal liability, and
    excise taxes could negatively impact our liquidity and results
    of operations.

Our Funding of
    our Company-Sponsored Qualified Pension Plan may Increase and
    our Earnings May Decrease Should Financial Markets Experience
    Future Declines

Our company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan)
    holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities.
    The amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent
    upon, among other things, the returns on the plan’s assets
    and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability.
    Our expense is also impacted by these items. Fluctuations in
    asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future
    contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to
    increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’
    equity on our balance sheet at fiscal year-end, which is when
    this plan’s funded status is measured. Also, the projected
    liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of
    interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as
    these are inputs in determining our discount rate at fiscal
    year-end. Specifically, decreases in these interest rates may
    have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To the
    extent financial markets experience future declines similar to
    those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal
    2010,

and/or

interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets
    decline, our contributions and pension expense may increase for
    future years as our funded status decreases, which could have an
    adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations.

Failure to
    Successfully Renegotiate Union Contracts Could Result in Work
    Stoppages

As of July 2, 2011, approximately 7,800 employees at
    52 operating companies were members of 55 different local unions
    associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and
    other labor organizations. In fiscal 2012, 21 agreements
    covering approximately 2,000 employees have expired or will
    expire. Since July 2, 2011, two contracts covering 85 of
    the approximately 2,000 employees have been renegotiated.
    Failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate
    these contracts could result in work stoppages. Although our
    operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant
    labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and we believe they
    have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work
    stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to
    renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect
    on us.

A Shortage of
    Qualified Labor Could Negatively Impact our Business and
    Materially Reduce Earnings

Our operations rely heavily on our employees, particularly
    drivers, and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly
    affect our business. Our recruiting and retention efforts and
    efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and
    there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods.
    Any such shortage would decrease Sysco’s ability to
    effectively serve our customers. Such a shortage would also
    likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding
    reduction in our net earnings.

Our Authorized
    Preferred Stock Provides Anti-Takeover Benefits that may not be
    Viewed as Beneficial to Stockholders

Under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Sysco’s
    Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to
    1,500,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder
    approval. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult
    for anyone to acquire Sysco without approval of the Board of
    Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock
    issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire Sysco without
    approval of the Board of Directors of Sysco, the existence of
    this undesignated preferred stock could allow the Board of
    Directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining
    stockholder approval, which could result in substantial dilution
    to a potential acquirer. As a result, hostile takeover attempts
    that might result in an acquisition of Sysco, that could
    otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders,
    could be deterred.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants,
    healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments
    and other foodservice customers. Our operations are primarily
    located throughout the United States, Canada and Ireland and
    include broadline companies, custom-cut meat operations,
    specialty produce companies, hotel supply operations, SYGMA (our
    chain restaurant distribution subsidiary) and a company that
    distributes to international customers.

We consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in
    the United States and Canada and estimate that we serve about
    17% of this approximately $220 billion annual market.
    According to industry sources, the foodservice, or
    food-away-from-home, market represents approximately 47% of the
    total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level
    in the United States. This share grew from about 37% in 1972 to
    nearly 50% in 1998 and did not change materially until 2009 when
    it declined to the current level of 47%.

Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the
    United States experienced a real sales decline of approximately
    0.8% in calendar year 2010 and 6.9% in calendar year 2009. Real
    sales declines do not include the impact of inflation or
    deflation.

General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect
    the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for
    food-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and
    our sales. We believe the current general economic conditions,
    including pressure on consumer disposable income, have
    contributed to a decline in the foodservice market.
    Historically, we have grown at a faster rate than the overall
    industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented
    industry.

Highlights

A slow economic recovery in the United States, combined with
    rising product cost inflation and continued low levels of
    consumer confidence, contributed to a challenging business
    environment in fiscal 2011. Sales increased during fiscal 2011
    as compared to fiscal 2010; however, gross profit dollars grew
    at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses increased
    faster than gross profit partially due to a significant charge
    of $36.1 million from a withdrawal from a multi-employer
    pension plan. This resulted in a decline in operating income for
    fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Comparisons between
    fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are impacted by the presence of a

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010. Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday
    nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ending
    July 2, 2011, a 53-week year ending July 3, 2010 for
    fiscal 2010 and a 52-week year ending June 27, 2009. Our
    Results of Operations discussion includes reconciliations of the
    actual results for fiscal 2010 to the adjusted results for
    fiscal 2010 based on a 52-week fiscal year due to the impact of
    the 53-week year in fiscal 2010.

The following table sets forth the change in certain components
    of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a
    percentage increase or decrease over Fiscal 2010 on both a
    53-week basis, or GAAP basis, and an adjusted 52-week basis:

Sales were $39.3 billion in fiscal 2011, an increase of
    5.6% from the comparable prior year period. After adjusting for
    the estimated impact of the

rd

week, the increase would have been 7.7%. This adjusted increase
    was primarily due to increased prices from inflation and
    improving case volumes. Inflation, as measured by changes in our
    product costs, was an estimated 4.6% during fiscal 2011. The
    exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into
    U.S. dollars positively impacted sales by 0.5% and sales
    from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably
    impacted sales by 0.7%.

•

Operating income was $1.9 billion, a 2.2% decrease from the
    prior year. After adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, this decrease would have been 0.1%. This
    adjusted decrease was primarily driven by gross profit dollars
    growing at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses
    increasing faster than gross profit partially due to a
    significant charge of $36.1 million from a withdrawal from
    a multi-employer pension plan. Gross profit dollars increased
    3.0% in fiscal 2011 from the comparable prior year period but
    declined as a percentage of sales. This result was primarily due
    to the impact of significant inflation in certain product
    categories and strategic pricing initiatives. Operating expenses
    increased 5.0% primarily due to higher pay-related expense, an
    increase in net company-sponsored pension costs, provisions for
    withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans and higher fuel
    costs as compared to the prior year period. The impact of these
    factors on operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease
    in operating expenses resulting from the absence of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2011.

•

Net earnings were $1.2 billion, an 2.4% decrease from the
    prior year. After adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, the decrease would have been 0.3%. This adjusted
    decrease was primarily due to the factors discussed above and an
    increase in the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for
    fiscal 2011 was 36.96%, compared to an effective tax rate of
    36.20% for fiscal 2010. The difference between the tax rates for
    the two periods resulted largely from the one-time reversal of
    interest accruals for tax contingencies related to our
    settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010.



•

Basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.96,
    a decrease of 1.5% from the comparable prior year period. After
    adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, this would have been an increase of 0.5%. This
    adjusted increase is primarily a result of the factors discussed
    above. Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 were
    favorably impacted by two items. First, we recognized a
    favorable impact of $0.05 per share due to the gains recorded on
    the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate-owned life
    insurance (COLI) policies to their cash surrender values.
    Second, a favorable impact of $0.02 per share was recognized
    related to the recognition of deferred tax assets from the
    reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state
    net operating loss carryforwards. These favorable impacts were
    partially offset by $0.04 per share relating to the charge
    recorded upon withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan in
    the third quarter. Basic and diluted earnings per share for
    fiscal 2010 were favorably impacted by $0.05 per share due to
    the one-time reversal of a previously accrued liability related
    to the settlement of an outstanding tax matter with the IRS and
    $0.04 per share due to gains recorded on the adjustment of the
    carrying value of COLI policies to their cash surrender values.

Trends and
    Strategy

Trends

General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect
    the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for
    food-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and
    our sales. We believe the current general economic conditions,
    including pressure on consumer disposable income, have
    contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market.

We have experienced higher levels of product cost inflation this
    fiscal year as compared to fiscal 2010. While we are generally
    able to pass on modest levels of inflation to our customers, we
    were unable to pass through fully these higher levels of product
    cost inflation with the same gross profit percentage without
    negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore
    our business. While we cannot predict whether inflation will
    continue at current levels, periods of high inflation, either
    overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative
    impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce
    consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and may
    negatively impact our sales, gross profit, operating income and
    earnings.

We have also experienced higher operating costs this fiscal year
    from increased pay-related expense due to increased sales and
    gross profit as well as higher pension and fuel costs. We
    believe pay-related expense could continue to increase if sales
    and gross profit increase, as a portion of these costs is
    variable in nature. Pension costs will decrease in fiscal 2012
    primarily due to higher returns on assets of Sysco’s
    company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan)
    during fiscal 2011. Fuel costs are expected to increase in
    fiscal 2012 as a result of anticipated higher fuel prices. Our
    Business Transformation Project is a key part of our strategy to
    control costs and continue to grow our business. We believe
    expenses related to the project will increase in fiscal 2012 as
    compared to fiscal 2011 as we prepare to begin deployment of the
    project to our operating companies and increase our headcount in
    our shared services center.

Strategy

We are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the
    U.S. and Canada, while continuing to explore appropriate
    opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create
    shareholder value through adjacent and international businesses.

Day-to-day,

our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and
    deliver great products to our customers with exceptional
    service, with the aspiration of becoming each of our
    customers’ most valued business partner. We have identified
    five strategies to help us achieve our mission and vision:

•

Profoundly enriching the experience of doing business with
    Sysco:

Our primary focus is to help our customers
    succeed. We believe that by building on our current competitive
    advantages, we will be able to further differentiate our
    offering to customers. Our competitive advantages include our
    sales force of over 8,000 marketing associates; our diversified
    product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand
    products; the suite of services we provide to our customers such
    as business reviews and menu analysis; and our wide geographic
    presence in the United States and Canada. In addition, we have a
    portfolio of businesses spanning broadline, specialty meat,
    chain restaurant distribution, specialty produce, hotel
    amenities and export which serves our customers’ needs
    across a wide array of business segments. We believe this
    strategy of enriching the experience of doing business with
    Sysco will increase customer retention and profitably accelerate
    sales growth with both existing and new customers.

•

Continuously improving productivity in all areas of our
    business:

This includes removing costs from our
    operations through improved productivity without impacting our
    service to our customers. In particular, we continue to optimize
    warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation to
    achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers.
    Our multi-year Business Transformation Project is designed to
    help further improve productivity. In this project, we are
    developing and implementing an integrated software system to
    support a majority of our business processes to further
    streamline our operations and reduce costs. These systems are
    commonly referred to as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
    systems. We view the technology as an important enabler of this
    project; however the larger outcome of this project will be from
    transformed processes that standardize portions of our
    operations. This includes a shared business service center to
    centrally manage certain back-office functions that are
    currently performed at each operating company location.

•

Expanding our portfolio of products and services by
    initiating a customer-centric innovation
    program:

We continually explore opportunities to
    provide new and improved products, technologies and services to
    our customers.

•

Exploring, assessing and pursuing new businesses and
    markets:

This strategy is focused on identifying
    opportunities to expand the core business through growth in new
    international markets and in adjacent areas that complement our
    core foodservice distribution business.



As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly
    evaluate business opportunities, including potential
    acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses.

•

Developing and effectively integrating a comprehensive,
    enterprise-wide talent management process:

Our
    ability to drive results and grow our business is directly
    linked to having the best talent in the industry. We are
    committed to the continued enhancement of our talent management
    programs in terms of how we recruit, select, train and develop
    our associates throughout Sysco as well as succession planning.
    Our ultimate objective is to provide our associates with
    outstanding opportunities for professional growth and career
    development.

Business
    Transformation Project

In fiscal 2011, we substantially completed the design and build
    phases of our multi-year Business Transformation Project and we
    are testing the underlying ERP system and processes through a
    pilot implementation. We took more time to test the underlying
    ERP system and processes in fiscal 2011 than we originally
    anticipated. Our pilot operating company implemented the project
    and our shared services center became active in its support role
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We are also taking
    additional time in fiscal 2012 to improve the underlying systems
    prior to larger scale deployment. These actions have caused a
    delay in the project of approximately six to twelve months and
    until we reach the point where the underlying system functions
    as intended, our deployment timeline is still being determined.
    Although we expect the investment in the Business Transformation
    Project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the
    long-term, the costs will exceed the benefits during the testing
    and deployment stages of implementation, including fiscal 2012.

Gross project expenses related to the Business Transformation
    Project were $102.0 million in fiscal 2011 or $0.11 per
    share, $81.1 million in fiscal 2010 or $0.09 per share and
    $35.7 million in fiscal 2009 or $0.04 per share. Our cash
    outlay for fiscal 2011 was $278.8 million, of which
    approximately $196 million was capitalized. Provided the
    improvements needed in the underlying systems are obtained in
    the first half of fiscal 2012, we anticipate the software will
    be ready for its intended use in the second half of fiscal 2012,
    which will result in reduced capitalization as compared to
    fiscal 2011 and increased expense from both software
    amortization and deployment costs. We will also incur increased
    costs from the ramp up of our shared services center, continuing
    costs for additional phases of our Business Transformation
    Project and information technology support costs. Some of these
    increased costs will be partially offset by benefits obtained
    from the project, primarily in reduced headcount, however the
    costs will not exceed the benefits in fiscal 2012. We expect our
    gross project expenses related to the Business Transformation
    Project for fiscal 2012 to be approximately $280 million to
    $300 million and capital expenditures to be approximately
    $100 million to $120 million.

Impact of 53-week
    fiscal year in Fiscal 2010

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June
    30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ending July 2, 2011,
    a 53-week year ending July 3, 2010 for fiscal 2010 and a
    52-week year June 27, 2009 for 2009. Because the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2010 contained an additional week as compared
    to fiscal 2011, our Results of Operations for fiscal 2010 are
    not directly comparable to the current or prior year. Management
    believes that adjusting the fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
    for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more
    comparable financial results on a

year-over-year

basis. As a result, the Results of Operations discussion for
    fiscal 2010 presented below in certain instances discusses
    operating items that have been adjusted by one-fourteenth of the
    total metric for the fourth quarter, except as otherwise noted
    with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Failure to
    make these adjustments would cause the

year-over-year

changes in certain metrics such as sales, operating income, net
    earnings and diluted earnings per share to be overstated,
    whereas in certain cases, a metric may actually have increased
    rather than declined or declined rather than increased on a more
    comparable

year-over-year

basis. Our Results of Operations discussion includes
    reconciliations of the actual results for fiscal 2010 to the
    adjusted results for fiscal 2010 based on a 52-week fiscal year.

Sales

Sales for fiscal 2011 were 5.6% higher in fiscal 2011 than
    fiscal 2010. After adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, the increase in sales in fiscal 2011 would have
    been 7.7%. Sales for fiscal 2010 were 1.1% higher than fiscal
    2009. After adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2010 would have had a sales decrease of
    0.9%. Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth
    to adjusted sales growth/decline for the periods presented (see
    further discussion at “Impact of 53-week fiscal year in
    Fiscal 2010” above):

Sales for fiscal 2011, excluding the negative impact of the
    extra week in fiscal 2010, increased as a result of product cost
    inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices along
    with improving case volumes. Estimated product cost increases,
    an internal measure of inflation, were approximately 4.6% during
    fiscal 2011. Sales from acquisitions in the last 12 months
    favorably impacted sales by 0.7% for fiscal 2011. The changes in
    the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into
    U.S. dollars positively impacted sales by 0.5% compared to
    fiscal 2010.

Sales for fiscal 2010, in addition to the positive impact of the
    extra week in fiscal 2010, were increased by improving case
    volumes. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our
    foreign sales into U.S. dollars positively impacted sales
    by 0.9% compared to fiscal 2009. Sales from acquisitions within
    the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 0.5% for
    fiscal 2010. Product cost deflation and the resulting decrease
    in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in
    fiscal 2010. Estimated changes in product costs, an internal
    measure of deflation or inflation, were estimated as deflation
    of 1.5% during fiscal 2010. A change in customer sales mix as
    compared to fiscal 2009 also negatively impacted fiscal 2010
    sales. Case volumes increased at a greater rate within our
    contract based customer group which generally receives lower
    pricing for higher volume.



Operating
    Income

Cost of sales primarily includes our product costs, net of
    vendor consideration, and includes in-bound freight. Operating
    expenses include the costs of facilities, product handling,
    delivery, selling and general and administrative activities.
    Fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit;
    fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses.

Operating income decreased 2.2% in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010
    to $1.9 billion, and as a percentage of sales, declined to
    4.9% of sales. After adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2011
    over fiscal 2010 would have been 0.1%. This adjusted decrease
    was primarily driven by gross profit dollars growing at a slower
    rate than sales and operating expenses increasing faster than
    gross profit partially due to a significant charge of
    $36.1 million from a withdrawal from a multi-employer
    pension plan. Gross profit dollars increased 3.0% in fiscal 2011
    as compared to fiscal 2010, and operating expenses increased
    5.0% in fiscal 2011.

Operating income increased 5.5% in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009
    to $2.0 billion, and as a percentage of sales, increased to
    5.3% of sales. After adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, the increase in operating income in fiscal 2010
    over fiscal 2009 would have been 3.3%. This adjusted increase in
    operating income was primarily driven by a decrease in operating
    expenses. Gross profit dollars increased 1.0% in fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009, while operating expenses decreased 0.6%
    in fiscal 2010.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual operating income
    to adjusted operating income for the periods presented (see
    further discussion at “Impact of 53-week fiscal year in
    Fiscal 2010” above):

Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to
    fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased sales, partially offset
    by the negative comparison of the additional week included in
    fiscal 2010. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 18.62%
    in fiscal 2011, a decline of 47 basis points from the gross
    profit as a percentage of sales of 19.08% in fiscal 2010. This
    decline in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of
    the following factors described in the paragraphs below.

First, Sysco’s product cost inflation was estimated as
    inflation of 4.6% during fiscal 2011. Based on our product sales
    mix for fiscal 2011, we were most impacted by higher levels of
    inflation in the dairy, meat and seafood product categories in
    the range of 10% to 12%. Our largest selling product category,
    canned and dry, experienced inflation of 4%. While we are
    generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our
    customers, we were unable to pass through fully these higher
    levels of product cost inflation with the same gross profit
    percentage in these product categories without negatively
    impacting our customers’ business and therefore our
    business. While we cannot predict whether inflation will
    continue at these levels, prolonged periods of high inflation,
    either overall or in certain product categories, can have a
    negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can
    reduce consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and
    may negatively impact our sales, gross profit and earnings.

Second, ongoing strategic pricing initiatives in fiscal 2011
    lowered our prices to our customers in certain product
    categories in order to increase sales volumes. These initiatives
    are being phased in over time and resulted in short-term gross
    profit declines as a percentage of sales, but we believe will
    result in long-term gross profit dollar growth due to higher
    sales volumes and increased market share. We have experienced
    meaningful year over year volume growth with those items
    included in the early phases of these programs in the
    geographies where this program has been implemented. We believe
    the long-term benefits of these strategic initiatives will
    result in profitable market share growth.

Third, gross profit dollars for fiscal 2011 increased as a
    result of higher fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges were
    approximately $26.0 million higher in fiscal 2011 than in
    the comparable prior year period due to higher fuel prices
    incurred during fiscal 2011 and the application of fuel
    surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the
    third quarter and the entire fourth quarter. Assuming that fuel
    prices do not greatly vary from recent levels experienced in the
    second half of fiscal 2011, we expect fuel surcharges to largely
    offset our increased fuel costs expected in fiscal 2012.

Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to
    fiscal 2009 primarily due to the additional week included in
    fiscal 2010. In addition, gross profit reflected product cost
    deflation in fiscal 2010 as compared to product cost inflation
    in fiscal 2009. We may be negatively impacted by prolonged
    periods of product cost deflation because a significant portion
    of our sales are at prices based on the cost of products sold
    plus a percentage markup. As a result, our profit levels may be
    negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation,
    even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively
    constant. Gross profit dollars for fiscal 2010 were also
    impacted by lower fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges were
    approximately $49.6 million lower in fiscal 2010 than
    fiscal 2009.

Operating expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 5.0% primarily due
    to higher pay-related expense, an increase in net
    company-sponsored pension costs, provisions for withdrawal from
    multi-employer pension plans and higher fuel costs as compared
    to the prior year period. The



impact of these operating expense increases was partially offset
    by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately
    $99.8 million resulting from the absence of the
    53rd week in fiscal 2011.

Operating expenses for fiscal 2010 were lower than in fiscal
    2009 primarily due to reduced fuel costs and a favorable
    comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value
    of COLI policies to their cash surrender values in both periods.
    Partially offsetting these operating expense declines were
    increases in pay-related expenses, net company-sponsored pension
    costs and approximately $99.8 million of expense associated
    with the additional week included in fiscal 2010.

Pay-related expenses, excluding labor costs associated with our
    Business Transformation Project, increased by $62.8 million
    in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due
    to increased sales and gross profit, which resulted in increased
    delivery personnel costs and sales compensation. Portions of our
    pay-related expense are variable in nature and are expected to
    increase when sales and gross profit increase. Pay-related
    expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange
    rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars
    also contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting these
    increases were lower provisions for current management incentive
    bonuses of $12.1 million.

Pay-related expenses, excluding labor costs associated with our
    Business Transformation Project, increased by $43.9 million
    in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 increase was
    primarily due to increased provisions for management incentive
    accruals and cost associated with the additional week included
    in fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these increases were lower
    pay-related expenses due to reduced headcount. The criteria for
    paying annual bonuses to our corporate officers and certain
    portions of operating company management bonuses are tied to
    overall company performance. In fiscal 2010, the overall company
    performance criteria for payment of such bonuses was met;
    therefore, the provision for current management incentive
    bonuses was higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 when the
    company assessed it did not meet the criteria for paying certain
    annual bonuses. Headcount declines occurred in fiscal 2010 due
    to both productivity improvements and workforce reductions
    commensurate with lower sales. Headcount was 2.2% lower at the
    end of fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

Net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2011 were
    $60.3 million higher than in fiscal 2010. The increase in
    fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in discount rates
    used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related
    pension expense at the end of fiscal 2010, partially offset by
    reduced amortization of our net actuarial loss resulting from
    actuarial gains from higher returns on assets of Sysco’s
    Retirement Plan during fiscal 2010. Net company-sponsored
    pension costs in fiscal 2012 have been determined as of the
    fiscal 2011 year-end measurement date and will decrease by
    approximately $27 million from fiscal 2011 due primarily to
    higher returns on assets of Sysco’s Retirement Plan during
    fiscal 2011.

Net company-sponsored pension costs were $37.4 million
    higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009. The increase in
    fiscal 2010 was due primarily to lower returns on assets of
    Sysco’s company-sponsored qualified pension plan
    (Retirement Plan) during fiscal 2009, partially offset by an
    increase in the discount rates used to calculate our projected
    benefit obligation and related pension expense for fiscal 2010.

From time to time, we may voluntarily withdraw from
    multi-employer pension plans to minimize or limit our future
    exposure to these plans. We recorded provisions related to
    multi-employer pension plans of $41.5 million in fiscal
    2011, $2.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $9.6 million in
    fiscal 2009. See additional discussion of multi-employer pension
    plans at “Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other
    Considerations, Multi-Employer Pension Plans.”

Sysco’s fuel costs increased by $33.0 million in
    fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased
    contracted and market diesel prices. Our fuel costs decreased by
    $71.8 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily due
    to decreased contracted diesel prices. Sysco’s costs per
    gallon increased 14.3% in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010, as
    compared to a decrease of 26.1% in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009.
    Sysco’s activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing
    miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques,
    improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum
    speeds and using fuel surcharges. We routinely enter into
    forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected
    monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a
    portion of the volatility in fuel prices.

Our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs
    or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on
    the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective
    periods. In fiscal 2011, the forward purchase commitments
    resulted in an estimated $16.4 million of avoided fuel
    costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than
    market prices for the contracted volumes. In fiscal 2010, the
    forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated
    $1.5 million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price
    contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted
    volumes for a portion of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2009, the
    forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated
    $67.7 million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price
    contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted
    volumes.

As of July 2, 2011, we had forward diesel fuel commitments
    totaling approximately $86 million through June 2012. These
    contracts will lock in the price of approximately 30% to 35% of
    our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices
    lower than the current market price for diesel for the first
    26 weeks of fiscal 2012 and near the current market price
    for diesel for the remainder of the fiscal year. Subsequent to
    July 2, 2011, we entered into forward diesel fuel
    commitments totaling approximately $17 million for July and
    August 2012. Assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly
    over recent levels during fiscal 2012, fuel costs exclusive of
    any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to
    increase by approximately $35 million to $45 million
    as compared to fiscal 2011. Our estimate is based upon current,
    published quarterly market price projections for diesel, the
    cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements
    currently in place for fiscal 2012 and estimates of fuel
    consumption. Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if
    any of these assumptions change, in particular if future fuel
    prices vary significantly from our current estimates. We
    continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential
    increases in fuel expense, including the use of fuel surcharges
    and overall expense management. Based on our current
    projections, we anticipate that the increase in fuel surcharges
    will offset the majority of our projected fuel cost increase in
    fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011.



Gross project expenses related to our Business Transformation
    Project, inclusive of pay-related expense, increased by
    $20.8 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 and by
    $41.6 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009. The increase
    in fiscal 2011 resulted from increased project spend including
    the initial stages of ramping up of our shared services center
    and a provision for severance resulting from the implementation
    of an involuntary severance plan. The increase in fiscal 2010
    resulted from only six months of activity being included in
    fiscal 2009, as the Business Transformation Project began in
    January 2009. Provided the improvements needed in the underlying
    systems are obtained in the first half of fiscal 2012, we
    anticipate the software will be ready for its intended use in
    the second half of fiscal 2012, which will result in increased
    expense from both software amortization and deployment costs. We
    will also incur increased costs from the ramp up of our shared
    services center, continuing costs for additional phases of our
    Business Transformation Project and information technology
    support costs. We believe the increase in gross project
    expenses, including all pay-related expenses, related to the
    Business Transformation Project in fiscal 2012 as compared to
    fiscal 2011 will be approximately $175 million to
    $195 million.

We adjust the carrying values of our COLI policies to their cash
    surrender values on an ongoing basis. The cash surrender values
    of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying
    investments, which through fiscal 2011 included publicly traded
    securities. As a result, the cash surrender values of these
    policies fluctuated with changes in the market value of such
    securities. The changes in the financial markets resulted in
    gains for these policies of $28.2 million in fiscal 2011,
    compared to gains for these policies of $21.6 million in
    fiscal 2010 and losses of $43.8 million in fiscal 2009.
    Near the end of fiscal 2011, we reallocated all of our policies
    into low-risk, fixed-income securities and therefore we no
    longer expect significant volatility in operating income, net
    earnings and earnings per share in future periods related to
    these policies.

The provision for losses on receivables included within
    operating expenses decreased by $39.7 million in fiscal
    2010 over fiscal 2009. The decrease in our provision for losses
    on receivables in fiscal 2010 reflects fewer customer accounts
    exceeding our threshold for write-off in fiscal 2010 as compared
    to fiscal 2009. Customer accounts written off, net of
    recoveries, were $37.8 million, or 0.10% of sales,
    $34.3 million, or 0.10% of sales, and $71.9 million,
    or 0.20% of sales, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Our provision for losses on receivables will fluctuate with
    general market conditions, as well as the circumstances of our
    customers.

Net
    Earnings

Net earnings for fiscal 2011 decreased 2.4% over the comparable
    prior year period. After adjusting for the estimated impact of
    the 53

rd

week in fiscal 2010, the decrease would have been 0.3%. This
    adjusted decrease was primarily due to the factors discussed
    above and an increase in the effective tax rate. The effective
    tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 36.96%, compared to an effective
    tax rate of 36.20% for fiscal 2010. The difference between the
    tax rates for the two periods resulted largely from the one-time
    reversal of interest accruals for tax contingencies related to
    our settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010.

Net earnings increased 11.7% in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009.
    After adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, the increase would have been 9.5%. This adjusted
    increase was primarily due to a reduction in the effective
    income tax rate, as well as the factors discussed above. The
    effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 36.20%, compared to an
    effective tax rate of 40.37% for fiscal 2009. The difference
    between the tax rates for the two periods resulted largely from
    the one-time reversal of interest accruals for tax contingencies
    related to our settlement with the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS) in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual net earnings to
    adjusted net earnings for the periods presented (see further
    discussion at “Impact of 53-week fiscal year in Fiscal
    2010” above):

The effective tax rate of 36.96% for fiscal 2011 was favorably
    impacted primarily by two items. First, we recorded a tax
    benefit of approximately $17.0 million for the reversal of
    valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating
    loss carryforwards. Second, we adjust the carrying values of our
    COLI policies to their cash surrender values. The gain of
    $28.2 million recorded in fiscal 2011 was primarily
    non-taxable for income tax purposes, and had the impact of
    decreasing income tax expense for the period by
    $11.1 million. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts
    was the recording of $9.3 million in tax and interest
    related to various federal, foreign and state uncertain tax
    positions.

The effective tax rate of 36.20% for fiscal 2010 was favorably
    impacted primarily by two items. First, we recorded an income
    tax benefit of approximately $29.0 million resulting from
    the one-time reversal of a previously accrued liability related
    to the settlement with the IRS (See “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources, Other Considerations, BSCC Cooperative
    Structure” for additional discussion). Second, the gain of
    $21.6 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of COLI
    policies to their cash surrender values in fiscal 2010 was
    non-taxable for income tax purposes, and had the impact of
    decreasing income tax expense for the period by
    $8.3 million.

The effective tax rate of 40.37% for fiscal 2009 was unfavorably
    impacted primarily by two factors. First, we recorded tax
    adjustments related to federal and state uncertain tax positions
    of $31.0 million. Second, the loss of $43.8 million
    recorded to adjust the carrying value of COLI policies to their
    cash surrender values in fiscal 2009 was non-deductible for
    income tax purposes, and had the impact of increasing income tax
    expense for



the period by $16.8 million. The effective tax rate for
    fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by the reversal of valuation
    allowances of $7.8 million previously recorded on Canadian
    net operating loss deferred tax assets.

Earnings Per
    Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 1.5% in fiscal
    2011 from the prior year. After adjusting for the estimated
    impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, earnings per share increased 0.5%. This adjusted
    increase was primarily the result of factors discussed above, as
    well as a net reduction in shares outstanding. The net reduction
    in both average and diluted shares outstanding was primarily due
    to share repurchases which occurred during the first
    26 weeks of fiscal 2011.

Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share
    increased 12.4% in fiscal 2010 from the prior year. After
    adjusting for the estimated impact of the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2010, this increase would have been 10.2%. This
    adjusted increase was primarily the result of factors discussed
    above, as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding. The net
    reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to
    share repurchases. The net reduction in diluted shares
    outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and an
    increase in the number of anti-dilutive options excluded from
    the diluted shares calculation.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual diluted earnings
    per share to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods
    presented (see further discussion at “Impact of 53-week

Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 were
    favorably impacted by two items. First, we recognized a
    favorable impact of $0.05 per share due to the gains recorded on
    the adjustment of the carrying value of COLI policies to their
    cash surrender values. Second, a favorable impact of $0.02 per
    share was recognized related to the recognition of deferred tax
    assets from the reversal of valuation allowances previously
    recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards. These
    favorable impacts were partially offset by $0.04 per share
    relating to the charge recorded upon withdrawal from a
    multi-employer pension plan in the third quarter.

Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2010 were
    favorably impacted by $0.05 per share due to the one-time
    reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the
    settlement of an outstanding tax matter with the IRS and $0.04
    per share due to gains recorded on the adjustment of the
    carrying value of COLI policies to their cash surrender values.

Segment
    Results

We have aggregated our operating companies into a number of
    segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable
    segments as defined in accounting provisions related to
    disclosures about segments of an enterprise. Beginning in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2011, the company’s custom-cut meat
    operations were reorganized to function as part of the United
    States Broadline segment. As a result, the results of the
    custom-cut meat operations are included in the Broadline
    reportable segment in the segment discussion below. Previously,
    these operations were an independent segment and were presented
    with the “Other” financial information relating to
    non-reportable segments. Segment reporting for the comparable
    prior year periods has been revised to conform to the new
    classification of the custom-cut meat operations as part of the
    Broadline reportable segment.

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those
    disclosed by Sysco within the Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data within Part II Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce
    products distributed by the Broadline and SYGMA operating
    companies. The segment results include certain centrally
    incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our
    segments. These centrally incurred costs are charged based upon
    the relative level of service used by each operating company
    consistent with how management views the performance of its
    operating segments.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our operating
    segments based on its respective operating income results, which
    include the allocation of certain centrally incurred costs.
    While a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the
    short term by increases or decreases in gross profits, expenses,
    or a combination thereof, over the long-term each business
    segment is expected to increase its operating income at a
    greater rate than sales growth. This is consistent with our
    long-term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate
    than sales growth.

Included in corporate expenses, among other items, are:

•

Gains and losses recognized to adjust COLI policies to their
    cash surrender values;

•

Share-based compensation expense;

•

Expenses related to the company’s Business Transformation
    Project; and

•

Corporate-level depreciation and amortization expense.



The following table sets forth the operating income of each of
    our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a
    percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported
    and should be read in conjunction with Note 19,

Broadline
    Segment

The Broadline reportable segment consists of the aggregated
    results of the United States, Canadian and European Broadline
    segments, as well as the custom-cut meat operations. Broadline
    operating companies distribute a full line of food products and
    a wide variety of non-food products to customers. Broadline
    operations have significantly higher operating margins than the
    rest of Sysco’s operations. In fiscal 2011, the Broadline
    operating results represented approximately 81% of Sysco’s
    overall sales and 93% of the aggregate operating income of
    Sysco’s segments, which excludes corporate expenses and
    consolidated adjustments.

There are several factors which contribute to these higher
    operating results as compared to the SYGMA and Other operating
    segments. We have invested substantial amounts in assets,
    operating methods, technology and management expertise in this
    segment. The breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its
    distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to leverage
    this segment’s earnings.

Sales

Sales for fiscal 2011 were 5.1% greater than fiscal 2010.
    Negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal 2011 to
    fiscal 2010 was the additional week in fiscal 2010. Product cost
    inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices, combined
    with case volume improvement, contributed to the increase in
    sales in fiscal 2011. Changes in product costs, an internal
    measure of inflation or deflation, were estimated as inflation
    of 4.9% in fiscal 2011. Non-comparable acquisitions contributed
    0.8% to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2011. The
    changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign
    sales into U.S. dollars positively impacted sales by 0.6%
    compared to fiscal 2010.

Sales for fiscal 2010 were 1.4% greater than fiscal 2009. Case
    volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009. The changes in the exchange rates used
    to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars positively
    impacted sales by 1.0% compared to fiscal 2009. Non-comparable
    acquisitions contributed 0.6% to the overall sales comparison
    for fiscal 2010. Changes in product costs were estimated as
    deflation of 1.5% in fiscal 2010. This product cost deflation,
    which led to decreases in selling prices, and a change in
    customer sales mix partially offset case volume improvement in
    fiscal 2010. The additional week also contributed to the sales
    growth in fiscal 2010.



Operating
    Income

Operating income increased by 0.1% in fiscal 2011 over fiscal
    2010 as gross profit dollars increased slightly above the rate
    that operating expenses increased. However, it is important to
    note that operating expenses included a significant charge of
    $36.1 million from a withdrawal from a multi-employer
    pension plan. Additionally, negatively affecting the operating
    income comparison of fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 was the
    additional week in fiscal 2010.

Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to
    increased sales; however, gross profit dollars increased at a
    lower rate than sales. This slower growth in gross profit
    dollars was primarily the result of two factors. Based on
    Broadline’s product sales mix for fiscal 2011, it was most
    impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy, meat and
    seafood product categories in the range of 10% to 12%.
    Broadline’s largest selling product category, canned and
    dry, experienced inflation of 4%. While we are generally able to
    pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers, we
    were unable pass through fully these higher levels of product
    cost inflation with the same gross profit percentage in these
    product categories without negatively impacting our
    customers’ business and therefore our business. While we
    cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels,
    prolonged periods of high inflation, either overall or in
    certain product categories, can have a negative impact on our
    customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in
    the food-away-from-home market, and may negatively impact the
    Broadline segment’s sales, gross profit and earnings.
    Second, ongoing strategic pricing initiatives largely lowered
    our prices to our customers in certain product categories in
    order to increase sales volumes. These initiatives are being
    phased in over time and resulted in short-term gross profit
    declines as a percentage of sales, but we believe will result in
    long-term gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes
    and increased market share. We have experienced meaningful year
    over year volume growth with those items included in the early
    phases of these programs in the geographies where this program
    has been implemented. We believe the long-term benefits of these
    strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share
    growth.

In addition, gross profit dollars for fiscal 2011 increased as a
    result of higher fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges were
    approximately $19.4 million higher in fiscal 2011 than the
    prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a
    broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter
    and the entire fourth quarter due to higher fuel prices incurred
    during these periods. Assuming that fuel prices do not greatly
    rise above recent levels during fiscal 2012, we expect fuel
    surcharges to largely offset our increased fuel costs expected
    in fiscal 2012.

The expense increases in fiscal 2011 were driven largely by
    provisions for withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan and
    an increase in pay-related expenses. In fiscal 2011, we recorded
    provisions of $41.5 million for withdrawal liabilities from
    multi-employer pension plans from which union members elected to
    withdraw. The increase in pay-related expenses related to the
    sales and gross profit increase, including both delivery
    personnel costs and sales. Portions of our pay-related expense
    are variable in nature and are expected to increase when sales
    and gross profit increase. Pay-related expenses from acquired
    companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate
    our foreign sales into U.S. dollars also contributed to the
    increase.

Fuel costs were $22.0 million higher in fiscal 2011 than
    the prior year. Assuming that fuel prices do not rise
    significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2012, fuel costs
    for fiscal 2012 not including any amounts recovered through fuel
    surcharges, are expected to increase by approximately
    $25 million to $35 million as compared to fiscal 2011.
    Our estimate is based upon current, published quarterly market
    price projections for diesel, the cost committed to in our
    forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal
    2012 and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual fuel costs could
    vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change, in
    particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our
    current estimates. We continue to evaluate all opportunities to
    offset potential increases in fuel expense, including the use of
    fuel surcharges and overall expense management.

Operating income increased by 5.9% in fiscal 2010 over fiscal
    2009 primarily due to effective management of operations in the
    current economic environment by decreasing expenses as compared
    to the comparable prior year periods. Operating expenses
    decreased 1.2% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The
    additional week in fiscal 2010 contributed to the gross profit
    increase, partially offset by a decrease of approximately
    $37.4 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers
    in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to less usage of
    these surcharges in fiscal 2010. Expense performance for fiscal
    2010 was primarily due to reduced fuel cost and lower provision
    for losses on receivables and operating efficiencies, such as
    reduced pay — related expense due to reduced
    headcount. Fuel costs were $51.8 million lower in fiscal
    2010 than in the prior year. Partially offsetting these expense
    declines were increases in expenses related to the additional
    week in fiscal 2010.

From time to time, we may voluntarily withdraw from
    multi-employer pension plans to minimize or limit our future
    exposure to these plans. We recorded provisions related to
    multi-employer pension plans of $41.5 million in fiscal
    2011, $2.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $9.6 million in
    fiscal 2009.

SYGMA
    Segment

SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food
    products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain
    chain restaurant customer locations. SYGMA operations have
    traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of
    sales than Sysco’s other segments. This segment of the
    foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower
    overall operating margins as the volume that these customers
    command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins. These
    operations service chain restaurants through contractual
    agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case
    delivered basis.



Sales

Sales were 9.2% greater in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010.
    Negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal 2011 to
    fiscal 2010 was the additional week in fiscal 2010. The increase
    in sales was primarily due to case volume improvement largely
    attributable to new customers and, to a lesser extent, from an
    increase in volume from certain existing customers.

Sales were 1.1% greater in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009. The
    additional week contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2010.
    Case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal
    2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. This case growth was largely
    attributable to new customers added largely in the latter part
    of the fiscal year and the additional week in fiscal 2010.
    Partially offsetting these case volume improvements was a
    decline in volume from existing customers due to the weak
    economic environment which applied continued pressure to
    consumer discretionary spending and negatively impacted overall
    restaurant traffic counts. Product cost deflation, which led to
    decreases in selling prices also impacted fiscal 2010 sales
    growth.

One chain restaurant customer (The Wendy’s Company)
    accounted for approximately 31% of the SYGMA segment sales for
    the fiscal year ended July 2, 2011. SYGMA maintains
    multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with
    this customer. While the loss of this customer would have a
    material adverse effect on SYGMA, we do not believe that the
    loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on
    Sysco as a whole.

Operating
    Income

Operating income increased $12.9 million in 2011 over the
    prior year due to increased sales and improved productivity.
    Gross profit dollars increased 9.5% while operating expenses
    increased 7.3% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010. Contributing to
    the gross profit increase in fiscal 2011 were increased sales
    and an increase of approximately $6.6 million in the fuel
    surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2011 from prior year
    due to higher fuel prices in fiscal 2011. The increase in
    operating expenses for fiscal 2011 was largely driven by
    increased delivery and warehouse personnel payroll costs
    resulting from increased sales as well as increased fuel cost.
    Productivity improvements occurred within our warehouse and
    delivery functions in fiscal 2011 and expense reductions
    occurred within our administrative functions in fiscal 2011 as
    compared to the prior year. Fuel costs in fiscal 2011 were
    $12.9 million greater than the prior year. Assuming that
    fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during
    fiscal 2012, we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our
    SYGMA segment to increase as compared to fiscal 2011.

Operating income increased by $17.1 million in fiscal 2010
    as compared to fiscal 2009. Gross profit dollars increased 0.7%
    while operating expenses decreased 3.7% in fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009. The additional week in fiscal 2010
    contributed to the gross profit increase, partially offset by a
    decrease of approximately $11.4 million in the fuel
    surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009 due to lower fuel prices in fiscal 2010. Expense
    reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both
    delivery and warehouse areas, as well as lower payroll expense
    related to headcount reductions. Also contributing to the
    decrease in operating expenses was a decrease of
    $10.1 million in fuel costs in fiscal 2010 from the prior
    year due to lower fuel prices.

Other
    Segment

“Other” financial information is attributable to our
    other operating segments, including our specialty produce and
    lodging industry products and a company that distributes to
    international customers. These operating segments are discussed
    on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable
    segments under segment accounting literature.

On an aggregate basis, our “Other” segment has had a
    lower operating income as a percentage of sales than
    Sysco’s Broadline segment. Sysco has acquired the operating
    companies within these segments in relatively recent years.
    These operations generally operate in a niche within the
    foodservice industry. Each individual operation is also
    generally smaller in sales and scope than an average Broadline
    operation and each of these operating segments is considerably
    smaller in sales and overall scope than the Broadline segment.
    In fiscal 2011, in the aggregate, the “Other” segment
    represented approximately 5.6% of Sysco’s overall sales and
    4.1% of the aggregate operating income of Sysco’s segments,
    which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments.

Operating income increased 9.6% for fiscal 2011 from fiscal
    2010. The operating income comparison was negatively affected by
    the additional week in fiscal 2010. The increase in operating
    income was caused primarily by increased sales in the specialty
    produce segment and favorable expense management in the
    specialty produce and lodging industry products segments.

Operating income increased 29.7% for fiscal 2010 from fiscal
    2009. The increase in operating income was caused primarily by
    increased sales in our specialty produce segment and increased
    operating income in all segments due to favorable expense
    management. The additional week in fiscal 2010 also contributed
    to the increase in operating income.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Sysco’s strategic objectives require continuing investment
    and our financial resources include cash provided by operations
    and access to capital from financial markets. Our operations
    historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated
    from operations is generally allocated to working capital
    requirements; investments in facilities, systems, fleet, other
    equipment and technology; acquisitions compatible with our
    overall growth strategy; and cash dividends. Any remaining cash
    generated from operations may be invested in high-quality,
    short-term instruments or applied toward the cost of the share
    repurchase program. As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis,
    we regularly evaluate



business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and
    sales of assets and businesses, and our overall capital
    structure. Any transactions resulting from these evaluations may
    materially impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage
    ratios and capital availability.

Our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by
    economic trends and conditions primarily due to their impact on
    our cash flows from operations. Weak economic conditions and low
    levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on
    consumer disposable income can lower our sales growth and
    potentially our cash flows from operations. While these factors
    were present in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, they had only a
    modest impact on our cash flows from operations in these periods
    due in large part to effective working capital management. We do
    not believe current economic conditions will significantly
    impact our cash flows from operations in fiscal 2012, as we can
    respond to reduced consumer demand, if it were to occur, by
    lowering our working capital requirements. Additionally,
    approximately one-third of our customers are not impacted by
    general economic conditions to the same extent as restaurants
    and other food retailers. These customers include hospitals,
    nursing homes, schools and colleges. Product cost inflation can
    potentially lower our gross profit and cash flow from operations
    if we are unable to pass through all of the increased product
    costs with the same gross profit percentage to our customers.
    This occurred in fiscal 2011, as we were able to pass some, but
    not all, of our product cost increases on to our customers.
    However; we believe our mechanisms to manage product cost
    inflation, some of which are contractual, are sufficient to
    limit the impact on our cash flows from operations.

We believe that our cash flows from operations, the availability
    of additional capital under our existing commercial paper
    programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access
    capital from financial markets, including issuances of debt
    securities, either privately or under our shelf registration
    statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (SEC), will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash
    requirements for the next twelve months and beyond, while
    maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes.
    We believe that we will continue to be able to access the
    commercial paper market effectively as well as the long-term
    capital markets, if necessary. To further maintain and enhance
    our credit ratings on current and future debt, on
    January 19, 2011, the wholly-owned U.S. Broadline
    subsidiaries of Sysco Corporation entered into full and
    unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and
    debentures of Sysco Corporation. As of July 2, 2011, Sysco
    had a total of approximately $2.2 billion in senior notes
    and debentures outstanding that are covered by this guarantee.

Operating
    Activities

We generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations in
    fiscal 2011, $0.9 billion in fiscal 2010 and
    $1.6 billion in fiscal 2009. The increase of
    $206.1 million between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was
    driven largely by a reduction in the amount of payments made in
    relation to the IRS settlement of $316.0 million and
    reduced pension contributions in the amount of
    $136.2 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.
    These increases were partially offset by changes in working
    capital discussed in more detail below. The decrease of
    $691.3 million between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was
    driven largely by $528.0 million of payments related to the
    IRS settlement and $140.0 million of pension contributions
    made in advance for fiscal 2011. Additionally, several less
    significant items had offsetting impacts when comparing the cash
    flow from operations between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. As
    described under “Other Considerations, BSCC Cooperative
    Structure,” we will make the final payments under the IRS
    settlement in fiscal 2012 in the amount of $212 million.

Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 was primarily generated
    by net income, reduced by increases in receivables and inventory
    balances and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
    partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization
    expense and increases in accounts payable. Cash flow from
    operations in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to net income and
    non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, offset by
    decreases in accrued income taxes and other long-term
    liabilities and prepaid pension cost, net, increases in accounts
    receivable and inventory balances and changes in deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009
    was primarily due to net income, non-cash depreciation and
    amortization expense, an increase in accrued income taxes, and
    increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances. The
    increases in fiscal 2009 were partially offset by decreases in
    accounts payable balances and accrued expenses.

The increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances in
    fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were primarily due to sales growth.
    An increase in daily sales outstanding also contributed to the
    increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal
    2011. The decrease in accounts receivable and inventory balances
    in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the sales decline. The
    increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2011 and fiscal
    2010 was primarily from the growth in inventory resulting from
    sales growth. The decrease in accounts payable balances in
    fiscal 2009 was primarily from inventory decreases resulting
    from the sales decline. Accounts payable balances are impacted
    by many factors, including changes in product mix, cash discount
    terms and changes in payment terms with vendors.

Cash flow from operations was impacted by a decrease in accrued
    expenses of $43.3 million during fiscal 2011, an increase
    in accrued expenses of $58.0 million during fiscal 2010 and
    a decrease in accrued expenses of $120.3 million during
    fiscal 2009. The decrease in accrued expenses in the fiscal 2011
    was primarily due to the payment of the respective prior year
    annual incentive bonuses, partially offset by lower accruals for
    current year compensation incentives. The remainder of the
    decrease was driven by multiple changes in various other
    accruals, of which no item was individually significant. The
    increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2010 was primarily
    due to increases in incentive compensation accruals resulting
    from improved operating performance in fiscal 2010. The
    remainder of the increase was driven by multiple changes in
    various other accruals, of which no item was individually
    significant. The decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2009
    was primarily due to the payment of prior year annual incentive
    bonuses, offset by lower accruals for current year incentive
    bonuses.

Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2011 was negatively
    impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of
    $165.2 million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of
    $44.2 million. Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2010
    was negatively impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of $121.9 million and a decrease in accrued
    income taxes of $296.5 million. The main factor affecting
    both of these changes in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, as well as
    cash taxes paid, was the IRS settlement (discussed below in
    “Other Considerations, BSCC Cooperative



Structure”), which resulted in the payment of taxes of
    $212.0 million in fiscal 2011 and $528.0 million in
    fiscal 2010 for the settlement agreement. Partially offsetting
    the negative impact described above, the change in deferred tax
    assets and liabilities was impacted by the contribution of an
    additional $140.0 million to our company-sponsored
    qualified pension plan in fiscal 2010 for contributions that
    would normally have been made in fiscal 2011. Cash flow from
    operations for fiscal 2009 was positively impacted by an
    increase in accrued income taxes of $325.5 million,
    partially offset by changes in deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of $294.2 million. Total cash taxes paid were
    $907.7 million, $1,142.0 million and
    $735.8 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    The changes in all periods were also impacted by the current tax
    provision and current year estimated tax payments.

Other long-term liabilities increased $44.3 million during
    fiscal 2011. The increase for 2011 was primarily attributable to
    three items. First, we recorded withdrawal liabilities from
    multi-employer pension plans from which union members elected to
    withdraw during the period. Second, net company sponsored
    pension costs exceeded contributions to our company-sponsored
    pension plans during the period. Third, we recognized a
    provision for severance resulting from the implementation of an
    involuntary severance plan. Partially offsetting these
    increases, our liability for uncertain tax positions decreased
    as a result of settlements with various taxing authorities
    during the period.

Other long-term liabilities and prepaid pension cost, net,
    decreased $271.7 million during fiscal 2010. The decrease
    in fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to three items. First,
    pension contributions to our company-sponsored plans exceeded
    net company-sponsored pension costs. Second, our liability for
    deferred incentive compensation decreased due to accelerated
    distributions taken by plan participants of all or a portion of
    their vested balances pursuant to certain transitional relief
    under the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal
    Revenue Code and other regular distributions. Third, our
    liability for uncertain tax positions decreased as a result of
    the settlement with the IRS, as well as a reclass to accrued
    income taxes for amounts expected to be paid in fiscal 2011.

Other long-term liabilities and prepaid pension cost, net,
    decreased $48.4 million during fiscal 2009. The decrease in
    fiscal 2009 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our
    liability for uncertain tax benefits related to our settlement
    with the IRS. See additional discussion of an IRS settlement at
    “Other Considerations, BSCC Cooperative Structure.”
    The decrease was partially offset by a combination of the
    recording of net company-sponsored pension costs and incentive
    compensation deferrals.

We recorded net company-sponsored pension costs of
    $186.4 million, $126.1 million and $88.7 million
    during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.
    Our contributions to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans
    were $161.7 million, $297.9 million and
    $95.8 million during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal
    2009, respectively. Included in the $161.7 million of
    contributions in fiscal 2011 was a $140.0 million
    contribution to our Retirement Plan that would normally have
    been made in fiscal 2012. Included in the $297.9 million of
    contributions in fiscal 2010 was a $140.0 million
    contribution to our Retirement Plan that would normally have
    been made in fiscal 2011 and quarterly contributions totaling
    $140.0 million for fiscal 2010. Additional contributions to
    our Retirement Plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal
    2012, however we will evaluate our funding position at the end
    of fiscal 2012 and select the timing for a contribution at that
    time.

During fiscal 2011, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of
    $101.1 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2011
    and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired
    in previous fiscal years. During fiscal 2011, we acquired for
    cash broadline foodservice operations in central California; Los
    Angeles, California; Ontario, Canada; Lincoln, Nebraska; and
    Trenton, New Jersey.

During fiscal 2010, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of
    $29.3 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2010
    and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired
    in previous fiscal years. During fiscal 2010, we acquired for
    cash a broadline foodservice operation in Syracuse, New York, a
    produce distributor in Atlanta, Georgia and a seafood
    distributor in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

    cash broadline foodservice operations in Ireland, Los Angeles,
    California and Boston, Massachusetts, as well as a produce
    distributor in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Financing
    Activities

Equity

Proceeds from common stock reissued from treasury for
    share-based compensation awards were $332.7 million in
    fiscal 2011, $94.8 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $111.8 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in proceeds in
    fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in the number of options
    exercised in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 and 2009.
    The level of option exercises, and thus proceeds, will vary from
    period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our
    stock price.

We traditionally have engaged in Board-approved share repurchase
    programs. The number of shares acquired and their cost during
    the past three fiscal years were 10,000,000 shares for
    $291.6 million in fiscal 2011, 6,000,000 shares for
    $179.2 million in fiscal 2010 and 16,951,200 shares
    for $438.8 million in fiscal 2009. There were no additional
    shares repurchased through August 17, 2011, resulting in a
    remaining authorization by our Board of Directors to repurchase
    up to 13,386,600 shares, based on the trades made through
    that date. Our current share repurchase strategy is to purchase
    enough shares to keep our diluted average shares outstanding
    relatively constant. Based on forecasted and past share
    exercises pursuant to our option plans, we expect to repurchase
    slightly more shares in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011.

Dividends paid were $597.1 million, or $1.02 per share, in
    fiscal 2011, $579.8 million, or $0.98 per share, in fiscal
    2010 and $548.2 million, or $0.92 per share, in fiscal
    2009. In May 2011, we declared our regular quarterly dividend
    for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 of $0.26 per share, which
    was paid in July 2011.

In November 2000, we filed with the SEC a shelf registration
    statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be
    offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of
    August 17, 2011, 29,477,835 shares remained available
    for issuance under this registration statement.

Short-term
    Borrowings

We have uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for
    unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to
    $95.0 million, of which none was outstanding as of
    July 2, 2011 or August 17, 2011.

Our Irish subsidiary, Pallas Foods Limited, has a
    €10.0 million (Euro) committed facility for unsecured
    borrowings for working capital. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under this facility as of July 2, 2011 or
    August 17, 2011.

On June 30, 2011, a Canadian subsidiary of Sysco entered
    into a short-term demand loan facility for the purpose of
    facilitating a distribution from the Canadian subsidiary to
    Sysco, and Sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the
    bank to guarantee the loan. The amount borrowed was
    $182.0 million and was repaid in full on July 4, 2011.

Commercial Paper
    and Revolving Credit Facility

We have a Board-approved commercial paper program allowing us to
    issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to
    exceed $1.3 billion.

Sysco and one of our subsidiaries, Sysco International, ULC.,
    have a revolving credit facility supporting our U.S. and
    Canadian commercial paper programs. The facility, in the amount
    of $1.0 billion, expires on November 4, 2012, but is
    subject to extension.

During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, aggregate outstanding
    commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged
    from approximately zero to $330.3 million, zero to
    $1.8 million, and zero to $165.0 million,
    respectively. There were no commercial paper issuances
    outstanding as of July 2, 2011 and $300.0 million of
    commercial paper issuances outstanding as of August 17,
    2011.

During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, our aggregate commercial
    paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings had a weighted
    average interest rate of 0.25%, 0.80% and 0.88%, respectively.



Fixed Rate
    Debt

Included in current maturities of long-term debt as July 2,
    2011 are the 6.10% senior notes totaling
    $200.0 million, which mature in June 2012. These notes were
    issued by Sysco International, Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Sysco now known as Sysco International, ULC. It is our intention
    to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through
    issuances of commercial paper, senior notes or a combination
    thereof.

In February 2009, Sysco deregistered the securities remaining
    unsold under its then existing shelf registration statement that
    was filed with the SEC in February 2008 for the issuance of debt
    securities. In February 2009, Sysco filed with the SEC an
    automatically effective well-known seasoned issuer shelf
    registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate
    amount of debt securities that may be issued from time to time.

In March 2009, Sysco issued 5.375% senior notes totaling
    $250.0 million due March 17, 2019 (the 2019 notes) and
    6.625% senior notes totaling $250.0 million due
    March 17, 2039 (the 2039 notes) under its February 2009
    shelf registration. The 2019 and 2039 notes, which were priced
    at 99.321% and 98.061% of par, respectively, are unsecured, are
    not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a
    redemption provision which allows Sysco to retire the notes at
    any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued
    interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders
    are not penalized by early redemption. Proceeds from the notes
    will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate
    purposes, which may include acquisitions, refinancing of debt,
    working capital, share repurchases and capital expenditures.

In September 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap
    agreement that effectively converted $200.0 million of
    fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 to floating rate debt.
    In October 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement
    that effectively converted $250.0 million of fixed rate
    debt maturing in fiscal 2013 to floating rate debt. Both
    transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall
    borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure.
    These transactions were designated as fair value hedges since
    the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate
    debt resulting from changes in interest rates.

Total
    Debt

Total debt as of July 2, 2011 was $2.7 billion of
    which approximately 75% was at fixed rates with a weighted
    average of 5.9% and an average life of 15 years, and the
    remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 2.1%
    and an average life of one year. Certain loan agreements contain
    typical debt covenants to protect note holders, including
    provisions to maintain the company’s long-term debt to
    total capital ratio below a specified level. Sysco is currently
    in compliance will all debt covenants.

Other

As part of normal business activities, we issue letters of
    credit through major banking institutions as required by certain
    vendor and insurance agreements. As of July 2, 2011 and
    July 3, 2010, letters of credit outstanding were
    $23.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively.

Other
    Considerations

Multi-Employer
    Pension Plans

As discussed in Note 18, “Commitments and
    Contingencies”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8, we contribute to several multi-employer defined
    benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under
    collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented
    employees.

Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, our voluntary withdrawal or
    the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any
    underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would require us
    to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the
    multi-employer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities.
    Generally, Sysco does not have the greatest share of liability
    among the participants in any of the plans in which we
    participate. Based on the information available from plan
    administrators, which has valuation dates ranging from
    January 31, 2009 to December 31, 2009, we estimate our
    share of withdrawal liability on most of the multi-employer
    plans in which we participate could have been as much as
    $200.0 million as of July 2, 2011 based on a voluntary
    withdrawal. This estimate excludes plans for which Sysco has
    recorded withdrawal liabilities. The majority of the plans we
    participate in have a valuation date of calendar year-end. As
    such, the majority of our estimated withdrawal liability results
    from plans for which the valuation date was December 31,
    2009; therefore, our estimated liability reflects the asset
    losses incurred by the financial markets as of that date. Due to
    the lack of current information, we believe our current share of
    the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this
    estimate. In addition, if a multi-employer defined benefit plan
    fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the IRS
    may impose a non-deductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of
    the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers
    contributing to the fund.

From time to time, we may voluntarily withdraw from
    multi-employer pension plans to minimize or limit our future
    exposure to these plans. In the third quarter of fiscal 2011,
    the union members of one of our subsidiaries voted to withdraw
    from the union’s multi-employer pension plan and join
    Sysco’s company-sponsored Retirement Plan. This action
    triggered a partial withdrawal from the multi-employer pension
    plan. As a result, during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we
    recorded a withdrawal liability provision of approximately
    $36.1 million related to this plan. We have experienced
    other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from
    multi-employer pension plans. Total withdrawal liability
    provisions recorded include $41.5 million in fiscal 2011,
    $2.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $9.6 million in fiscal
    2009. As of July 2, 2011, we had approximately
    $42.4 million in liabilities recorded related to certain
    multi-employer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary
    withdrawal had already occurred, which includes the liability
    recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Recorded
    withdrawal liabilities are estimated at the time of withdrawal
    based on



the most recently available valuation and participant data for
    the respective plans; amounts are adjusted up to the period of
    payment to reflect any changes to these estimates. If any of
    these plans were to undergo a mass withdrawal, as defined by the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, within a two year time
    frame from the point of our withdrawal, we could have additional
    liability. We do not currently believe any mass withdrawals are
    probable to occur in the applicable two year time frame relating
    to the plans from which we have voluntarily withdrawn.

Required contributions to multi-employer plans could increase in
    the future as these plans strive to improve their funding
    levels. In addition, the Pension Protection Act, enacted in
    August 2006, requires underfunded pension plans to improve their
    funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of
    their underfunding. We believe that any unforeseen requirements
    to pay such increased contributions, withdrawal liability and
    excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations,
    borrowing capacity or a combination of these items.

During fiscal 2008, we obtained information that a
    multi-employer pension plan we participated in failed to satisfy
    minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded
    that it was probable that additional funding would be required
    as well as the payment of excise tax. As a result, during fiscal
    2008, we recorded a liability of approximately
    $16.5 million related to our share of the minimum funding
    requirements and related excise tax for these periods. During
    the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we effectively withdrew from
    this multi-employer pension plan in an effort to secure benefits
    for our employees that were participants in the plan and to
    manage our exposure to this under-funded plan. We agreed to pay
    $15.0 million to the plan, which included the minimum
    funding requirements. In connection with this withdrawal
    agreement, we merged active participants from this plan into
    Sysco’s company-sponsored Retirement Plan and assumed
    $26.7 million in liabilities. The payment to the plan was
    made in the early part of the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

BSCC Cooperative
    Structure

Sysco’s affiliate, Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative (BSCC),
    was a cooperative taxed under subchapter T of the United States
    Internal Revenue Code, the operation of which had resulted in a
    deferral of tax payments. The IRS, in connection with its audits
    of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns, proposed
    adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had
    previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of
    interest on those deferred amounts. Sysco reached a settlement
    with the IRS in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to cease paying
    U.S. federal taxes related to BSCC on a deferred basis, pay
    the amounts that were recorded within deferred taxes related to
    BSCC over a three-year period and make a one-time payment of
    $41.0 million, of which approximately $39.0 million
    was non-deductible. The settlement addressed the BSCC deferred
    tax issue as it relates to the IRS audit of our 2003 through
    2006 federal income tax returns, and settles the matter for all
    subsequent periods, including the 2007 and 2008 federal income
    tax returns already under audit. As a result of the settlement,
    we agreed to pay the amounts owed in the following schedule:

As noted in the table above, payments related to the settlement
    were $212.0 million and $528.0 million in fiscal 2011
    and fiscal 2010, respectively. Remaining amounts to be paid in
    2012 will be paid in connection with our quarterly tax payments,
    two of which fall in the second quarter, one in the third
    quarter and one in the fourth quarter. We believe we have access
    to sufficient cash on hand, cash flows from operations and
    current access to capital to make payments required in fiscal
    2012.

Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically
    payable only in the event that certain operating results are
    attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved.
    Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of
    July 2, 2011 included $56.6 million. This amount is
    not included in the table above.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying
    financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed
    by Sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements.

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are
    most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
    results of operations. These policies require our most
    subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of
    estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
    uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical
    accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure.
    Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to
    the allowance for



doubtful accounts receivable, self-insurance programs,
    company-sponsored pension plans, income taxes, vendor
    consideration, goodwill and intangible assets and share-based
    compensation.

Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and
    determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on
    a combination of factors. We utilize specific criteria to
    determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including
    whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in
    bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for
    collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods.
    Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on
    analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries. In
    addition, in circumstances where we are aware of a specific
    customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation, a
    specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce
    the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be
    collected. Our judgment is required as to the impact of certain
    of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of
    our accounts receivable. If the financial condition of our
    customers were to deteriorate, as was the case in fiscal 2009,
    additional allowances may be required.

Self-Insurance
    Program

We maintain a self-insurance program covering portions of
    workers’ compensation, general liability and vehicle
    liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured
    levels are fully insured by third party insurers. We also
    maintain a fully self-insured group medical program. Liabilities
    associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering
    historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic
    factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
    Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain
    because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and
    could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims
    differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an
    attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation,
    vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and
    awareness programs have been implemented.

Company-Sponsored
    Pension Plans

Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the
    financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Three
    of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations
    are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan
    benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future
    compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan
    assets.

For guidance in determining the discount rates, we calculate the
    implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of
    high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and
    amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of
    the pension plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed
    annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate
    for determining fiscal 2011 net pension costs for the
    Retirement Plan, which was determined as of the July 3,
    2010 measurement date, decreased 187 basis points to 6.15%.
    The discount rate for determining fiscal 2011 net pension
    costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the July 3,
    2010 measurement date, decreased 79 basis points to 6.35%.
    The combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our
    net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal
    2011 by an estimated $85.6 million. The discount rate for
    determining fiscal 2012 net pension costs for the
    Retirement Plan, which was determined as of the July 2,
    2011 measurement date, decreased 21 basis points to 5.94%.
    The discount rate for determining fiscal 2012 net pension
    costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the July 2,
    2011 measurement date, decreased 42 basis points to 5.93%.
    The combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase
    our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal
    2012 by an estimated $14.3 million. A 100 basis point
    increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2012 would decrease
    Sysco’s net company-sponsored pension cost by
    $59.0 million, while a 100 basis point decrease in the
    discount rates would increase pension cost by
    $68.7 million. The impact of a 100 basis point
    increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a
    100 basis point decrease in discount rates because the
    liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount
    rates. Therefore, a 100 basis point increase in the
    discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as
    a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate.

We look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of
    increase in compensation levels. We used a plan specific
    age-related set of rates for the Retirement Plan, which are
    equivalent to a single rate of 5.30% as of July 2, 2011 and
    July 3, 2010. For determining the benefit obligations as of
    July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the SERP calculations
    use an age-graded salary growth assumption.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the
    Retirement Plan was 8.00% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. The
    expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical
    asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various
    asset class returns, reflecting a combination of historical
    performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the
    financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, historical
    returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative
    investments. Although not determinative of future returns, the
    effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using
    geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 8.1%, 4.0%,
    4.1%, and 18.5%, over the

20-year,

10-year,

5-year

and

1-year

periods ended December 31, 2010, respectively. In addition,
    in nine of the last 15 years, the actual return on plan
    assets has exceeded 10%. The rate of return assumption is
    reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.

The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount
    of net pension costs. The expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets of the Retirement Plan is 7.75% for fiscal 2012. A
    100 basis point increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of
    return for fiscal 2012 would decrease (increase) Sysco’s
    net company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2012 by
    approximately $20.9 million.



Pension accounting standards require the recognition of the
    funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of
    financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount
    reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the
    recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as
    of July 2, 2011 was a charge, net of tax, of
    $501.1 million. The amount reflected in accumulated other
    comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded
    status of our defined benefit plans as of July 3, 2010 was
    a charge, net of tax, of $598.8 million.

Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount
    rate discussed above, together with the normal growth of the
    plans, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the
    timing and amount of contributions, increased net
    company-sponsored pension costs by approximately
    $60 million in fiscal 2011. Changes in the assumptions,
    including changes to the discount rate discussed above, together
    with the normal growth of the plans, the impact of actuarial
    losses from prior periods, the impact of plan amendments and the
    timing and amount of contributions are expected to decrease net
    company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2012 by approximately
    $27 million.

We made cash contributions to our company-sponsored pension
    plans of $161.7 million and $297.9 million in fiscal
    years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Included in the
    $161.7 million of contributions in fiscal 2011 was a
    $140.0 million contribution to our Retirement Plan that
    would normally have been made in fiscal 2012. We did not have a
    minimum required contribution to the Retirement Plan for the
    calendar 2010 plan year to meet ERISA minimum funding
    requirements. Included in the $297.9 million of
    contributions in fiscal 2010 the minimum required contribution
    for the calendar 2009 plan year to meet ERISA minimum funding
    requirements, as well as a $140.0 million contribution to
    our Retirement Plan that would normally have been made in fiscal
    2011. We do not have a minimum required contribution to the
    Retirement Plan for the calendar 2011 plan year to meet ERISA
    minimum funding requirements that must be made in fiscal 2012.
    Additional contributions to our Retirement Plan are not
    currently anticipated in fiscal 2012, however we will evaluate
    our funding position at the end of fiscal 2012 and select the
    timing for a contribution at that time. The estimated fiscal
    2012 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP plan
    are approximately $23 million.

Income
    Taxes

The determination of our provision for income taxes requires
    significant judgment, the use of estimates and the
    interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our
    provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of
    income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and
    state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law
    changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between
    book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for
    unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our
    change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions
    all affect the overall effective tax rate.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains
    uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions
    and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with
    our various filing positions. We believe that the judgments and
    estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual
    results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains
    that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for
    which a liability has been established, or pay amounts in excess
    of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a
    given financial statement period could be materially affected.
    An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our
    cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax
    rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may
    be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in
    the period of resolution.

Vendor
    Consideration

We recognize consideration received from vendors when the
    services performed in connection with the monies received are
    completed and when the related product has been sold by Sysco.
    There are several types of cash consideration received from
    vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the
    form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these
    instances, we will recognize the vendor consideration as a
    reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In some
    instances, vendor consideration is received upon receipt of
    inventory in our distribution facilities. We estimate the amount
    needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until
    the product is sold. Our inventory turnover is usually less than
    one month; therefore, amounts deferred against inventory do not
    require long-term estimation. In the situations where the vendor
    consideration is not related directly to specific product
    purchases, we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of
    sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service
    is performed and the amounts realized. Historically, adjustments
    to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been
    significant.

Goodwill and
    Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of
    consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets
    acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in
    determining the fair value of assets acquired, including
    goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the
    allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit.

In addition, annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently
    as needed, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair
    values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying
    values of these assets. The reporting units used in assessing
    goodwill impairment are our eight operating segments as
    described in Note 19, “Business Segment
    Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8. The components within each of our eight operating
    segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are
    aggregated into eight reporting units.



We arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of
    discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models. The results
    from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a
    single estimate of fair value for each of our eight operating
    segments. We use a 60% weighting for our discounted cash flow
    valuation and 40% for the earnings multiple models giving
    greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the
    forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the
    analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated
    changes for the businesses. The primary assumptions used in
    these various models include estimated earnings multiples of
    comparable acquisitions in the industry including control
    premiums, earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by Sysco
    in the past, future cash flow estimates of the reporting units,
    which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth
    rates, and weighted average cost of capital, along with working
    capital and capital expenditure requirements. When possible, we
    use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair
    values of our reporting units. We update our projections used in
    our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance
    and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.

Our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring
    management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate
    industry economic factors and the profitability of future
    business strategies. Actual results could differ from these
    assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising
    its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment
    loss. There were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived
    intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2011,
    2010 and 2009. Our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2010
    and 2009 have not been materially different when revised to
    include subsequent years’ actual results. Sysco has not
    made any material changes in its impairment assessment
    methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not
    believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely
    to change materially in the future but we will continue to
    assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of
    the reporting units. In the fiscal 2011 analysis our estimates
    of fair value did not require additional analysis; however, we
    would have performed additional analysis to determine if an
    impairment existed for the following reporting units if our
    estimates of fair value were decreased by the following amounts.
    First, our reporting unit that distributes to international
    customers would have required additional analysis if the
    estimated fair value had been 26% lower. Second, our European
    Broadline company would have required additional analysis if the
    estimated fair value had been 27% lower. Third, our lodging
    industry products reporting unit would have required additional
    analysis if the estimated fair value had been 29% lower. Lastly,
    our specialty produce operations would have required additional
    analysis if the estimated fair value had been 34% lower. At
    July 2, 2011, these four reporting units had goodwill
    aggregating $498.3 million. For the remainder of our
    reporting units which at July 2, 2011 had goodwill
    aggregating $1.1 billion, we would have performed
    additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a
    reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these
    reporting units had declined by greater than 50%.

Certain reporting units (European Broadline, specialty produce,
    custom-cut meat, lodging industry products and international
    distribution operations) have a greater proportion of goodwill
    recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the United
    States Broadline, Canadian Broadline or SYGMA reporting units.
    This is primarily due to these businesses having been recently
    acquired, and as a result there has been less history of organic
    growth than in the United States Broadline, Canadian Broadline
    and SYGMA reporting units. In addition, these businesses also
    have lower levels of cash flow than the United States Broadline
    reporting units. As such, these reporting units have a greater
    risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a
    significant downturn.

Share-Based
    Compensation

We provide compensation benefits to employees and non-employee
    directors under several share-based payment arrangements
    including various employee stock incentive plans, the
    Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive
    Plan and various non-employee director plans.

As of July 2, 2011, there was $61.3 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based
    compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.62 years.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected
    volatility is based on historical volatility of Sysco’s
    stock, implied volatilities from traded options on Sysco’s
    stock and other factors. We utilize historical data to estimate
    option exercise and employee termination behavior within the
    valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar
    historical exercise behavior are considered separately for
    valuation purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based
    on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock
    price for the year preceding the option grant. The risk-free
    rate for the expected term of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with
    a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price
    as of the date of grant. For restricted stock units granted
    without dividend equivalents, the fair value is reduced by the
    present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.

The fair value of the stock issued under the Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan is calculated as the difference between the stock
    price and the employee purchase price.

The fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based
    on the stock price on grant date. The application of a discount
    to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon
    whether or not each individual grant contains a post-vesting
    restriction.

The compensation cost related to these share-based awards is
    recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite
    service period is generally the period during which an employee
    is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The
    compensation cost related to stock



issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the
    Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan is recognized during the
    quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made.

Certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded
    vesting over a service period. In those cases, we will recognize
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. In other cases, certain of
    our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service
    period but include a performance-based provision allowing for
    the vesting to accelerate. In these cases, if it is probable
    that the performance condition will be met, we recognize
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the shorter
    performance period; otherwise, we recognize compensation cost
    over the probable longer service period.

In addition, certain of our share-based awards provide that if
    the award holder retires at certain age and years of service
    thresholds, the options continue to vest as if the award holder
    continued to be an employee or director. In these cases, for
    awards granted prior to July 2, 2005 (our adoption date for
    the fair value recognition provisions in current stock
    compensation accounting standards), we will recognize the
    compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service
    period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation
    cost when the employee retires. For awards granted subsequent to
    July 3, 2005, we will recognize compensation cost for such
    awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the
    employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options
    continuing to vest after retirement.

Our option grants include options that qualify as incentive
    stock options for income tax purposes. In the period the
    compensation cost related to incentive stock options is
    recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is
    assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such
    incentive stock options. We may be eligible for tax deductions
    in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a
    disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option. In such
    cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax
    deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding
    cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial
    statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory
    tax rate.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or
    express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect
    to the occurrence of future events are forward-looking
    statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995. They include statements about Sysco’s ability to
    increase its sales and market share and grow earnings, the
    continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence
    and our business, sales and expense trends, including
    expectations regarding pay-related expense and pension costs,
    anticipated multi-employer pension related liabilities and
    contributions to various multi-employer pension plans,
    expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax
    benefits and interest, expectations regarding share repurchases,
    expected trends in fuel pricing, usage costs and surcharges, our
    expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts
    receivable, expected implementation, costs and benefits of the
    ERP system, estimated expenses and capital expenditures related
    to our Business Transformation Project in fiscal 2012, our plan
    to continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow in
    international markets and adjacent areas that complement our
    core business, the impact of ongoing legal proceedings, the loss
    of SYGMA’s largest customer not having a material adverse
    effect on Sysco as a whole, compliance with laws and government
    regulations not having a material effect on our capital
    expenditures, earnings or competitive position, anticipated
    acquisitions and capital expenditures and the sources of
    financing for them, continued competitive advantages and
    positive results from strategic initiatives, anticipated
    company-sponsored pension plan liabilities, our expectations
    regarding cash flow from operations, the availability and
    adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities, the impact of future
    adoption of accounting pronouncements, predictions regarding the
    impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses, the
    anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    and Sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and
    remain profitable.

These statements are based on management’s current
    expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially
    due in part to the risk factors discussed at Item 1.A.
    above and elsewhere. In addition, the success of Sysco’s
    strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the
    economy and the industry and internal factors such as the
    ability to control expenses, including fuel costs. Expected
    trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by
    fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors
    affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control. Our
    efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by
    factors beyond our control, including actions by our competitors

and/or

customers. We have experienced delays in the implementation of
    our Business Transformation Project and the expected costs of
    our Business Transformation Project may be greater or less than
    currently expected, as we may encounter the need for changes in
    design or revisions of the project calendar and budget. Our
    business and results of operations may be adversely affected if
    we experience operating problems, scheduling delays, cost
    overages, or limitations on the extent of the business
    transformation during the ERP implementation process. As
    implementation of the ERP system and the Business Transformation
    Project begins, there may be changes in design or timing that
    impact near-term expense and cause us to revise the project
    calendar and budget, and additional hiring and training of
    employees and consultants may be required, which could also
    impact project expense and timing. Company-sponsored pension
    plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including
    the discount rate for determining the current value of plan
    benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future
    compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan
    assets. The amount of shares repurchased in a given period is
    subject to a number of factors, including available cash and our
    general working capital needs at the time. Our plans with
    respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas
    that complement our core business are subject to the
    company’s other strategic initiatives and plans and
    economic conditions generally. Legal proceedings are impacted by
    events, circumstances and individuals beyond the control of
    Sysco. The need for additional borrowing or other capital is
    impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or
    acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated, stock
    repurchases at historical levels, or other unexpected cash
    requirements. Predictions regarding the future adoption of
    accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit
    of precedent, and if our estimates turn out to be materially
    incorrect, our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement
    could prove incorrect, as well. The anticipated impact of
    compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that
    estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect, and laws and
    regulations, as well as methods of enforcement, are subject to
    change.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate
    Risk

We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes.
    Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk.
    Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates
    periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market
    interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is
    fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in
    market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt
    and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with
    new debt at higher rates.

We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired
    position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest
    rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position. The major risks
    from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest
    rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential
    increases in interest expense due to market increases in
    floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the
    counterparties in such transactions.

Fiscal

As of July 2, 2011, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
    Total debt as of July 2, 2011 was $2.7 billion, of
    which approximately 75% was at fixed rates of interest,
    including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements.

In fiscal 2010, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements that effectively converted $200 million of fixed
    rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 (the fiscal 2014 swap) and
    $250 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013
    (the fiscal 2013 swap) to floating rate debt. Both transactions
    were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing
    cost. These transactions were designated as fair value hedges
    since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed
    rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates.

As of July 2, 2011, the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized as
    an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value
    within other assets of $7.4 million. The fixed interest
    rate on the hedged debt is 4.6% and the floating interest rate
    on the swap is three-month LIBOR which resets quarterly. As of
    July 2, 2011, the fiscal 2013 swap was recognized as an
    asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within
    other assets of $6.1 million. The fixed interest rate on
    the hedged debt is 4.2% and the floating interest rate on the
    swap is three-month LIBOR which resets quarterly.

Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rate Risk

The majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local
    currency as their functional currency. To the extent that
    business transactions are not denominated in a foreign
    subsidiary’s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign
    currency exchange rate risk. We will also incur gains and losses
    within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of
    our financial statements from foreign currencies into
    U.S. dollars. Our income statement trends may be impacted
    by the translation of the income statements of our foreign
    subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. The changes in the exchange
    rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars
    positively impacted sales by 0.5% in fiscal 2011 compared to
    fiscal 2010 and 0.9% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The
    impact to our operating income, net earnings and earnings per
    share was not material in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. A 10%
    unfavorable change in the fiscal 2011 weighted

year-to-date

exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial
    statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2011 sales by
    0.6% and would not have materially impacted our operating
    income, net earnings and earnings per share. We do not routinely
    enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency
    exchange rate risks.

Our Canadian financing subsidiary has the U.S. dollar as
    its functional currency and has notes denominated in
    U.S. dollars. We have the potential to create taxable
    income in Canada when this debt is paid due to changes in the
    exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment
    date. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2011 year-end
    exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability
    associated with these notes would not have a material impact on
    our results of operations.

Fuel Price
    Risk

Due to the nature of our distribution business, we are exposed
    to potential volatility in fuel prices. The price and
    availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in
    production, seasonality and other market factors generally
    outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative
    impact on our results of operations in three areas. First, the
    high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and
    discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount
    spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases. Second,
    the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product
    purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to
    our customers. Third, increased



fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our
    customers. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, fuel costs related
    to outbound deliveries represented approximately 0.6%, 0.6% and
    0.8% of sales, respectively. Fuel costs, excluding any amounts
    recovered through fuel surcharges, incurred by Sysco increased
    by approximately $33.0 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal
    2010 and decreased by $71.8 million in fiscal 2010 over
    fiscal 2009.

We routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a
    portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. As of
    July 2, 2011, we had forward diesel fuel commitments
    totaling approximately $86 million through June 2012. These
    contracts will lock in the price of approximately 30% to 35% of
    our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices
    lower than the current market price for diesel for the first
    26 weeks of fiscal 2012 and near the current market price
    for diesel for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Fuel costs in fiscal 2012, exclusive of any amounts recovered
    through fuel surcharges, are expected to increase by
    approximately $35 million to $45 million as compared
    to fiscal 2011. Our estimate is based upon current, published
    quarterly market price projections for diesel, the cost
    committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently
    in place for fiscal 2012 and estimates of fuel consumption.
    Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these
    assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary
    significantly from our current estimates. A 10% unfavorable
    change in diesel prices from the market price used in our
    estimates above would change the range of potential increase to
    $55 million to $65 million.

Investment
    Risk

Our company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan)
    holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities.
    The amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent
    upon, among other things, the return on the plan’s assets
    and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability.
    Fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our
    anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and
    pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to
    shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal
    year-end, which is when this plan’s funded status is
    measured. Also, the projected liability of the plan will be
    impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality
    bonds in the public markets. Specifically, decreases in these
    interest rates may have a material impact on our results of
    operations. To the extent the financial markets experience
    declines, our anticipated future contributions, pension expense
    and funded status will be affected for future years. A 10%
    unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our
    company-sponsored Retirement Plan at the plan’s fiscal year
    end (December 31, 2010) would not have a material
    impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2012;
    however, this unfavorable change would increase our pension
    expense for fiscal 2012 by $39.8 million and would reduce
    our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of
    July 2, 2011 by $129.7 million.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The management of Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting for the company. Sysco’s
    internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
    statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well
    designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
    systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
    assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
    presentation.

Sysco’s management assessed the effectiveness of
    Sysco’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    July 2, 2011. In making this assessment, it used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, management
    concluded that, as of July 2, 2011, Sysco’s internal
    control over financial reporting was effective based on those
    criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the
    effectiveness of Sysco’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of July 2, 2011.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Sysco Corporation

We have audited Sysco Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and
    its subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting
    as of July 2, 2011, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Sysco Corporation’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Sysco Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of July 2, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of July 2,
    2011 and July 3, 2010 and the related consolidated results
    of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each
    of the three years in the period ended July 2, 2011 of
    Sysco Corporation and subsidiaries and our report dated
    August 30, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

Sysco Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Sysco Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of July 2, 2011 and July 3,
    2010, and the related consolidated results of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended July 2, 2011. These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of the Company at July 2, 2011 and
    July 3, 2010, and the consolidated results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended July 2, 2011, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Sysco
    Corporation and its subsidiaries’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of July 2, 2011, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated August 30, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY OF
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business and
    Consolidation

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and
    divisions, (Sysco or the company), is engaged in the marketing
    and distribution of a wide range of food and related products
    primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry.
    These services are performed for approximately 400,000 customers
    from 177 distribution facilities located throughout the United
    States, Canada and Ireland.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June
    30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ending July 2, 2011,
    a 53-week year ending July 3, 2010 for fiscal 2010 and a
    52-week year ending June 27, 2009 for 2009.

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of
    Sysco and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany transactions and account balances have been
    eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, sales and expenses. Actual results could differ
    from the estimates used.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

For cash flow purposes, cash includes cash equivalents such as
    time deposits, certificates of deposit, short-term investments
    and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of
    three months or less, which are recorded at fair value.

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from
    customers and receivables from suppliers for marketing or
    incentive programs. Sysco determines the past due status of
    trade receivables based on contractual terms with each customer.
    Sysco evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and
    determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based
    on a combination of factors. The company utilizes specific
    criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written
    off including whether a customer has filed for or been placed in
    bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for
    collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods.
    Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on an
    analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries. In
    addition, in circumstances where the company is aware of a
    specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligation to Sysco, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts
    is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount
    reasonably expected to be collected.

Inventories

Inventories consisting primarily of finished goods include food
    and related products and lodging products held for resale and
    are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Elements of costs include the
    purchase price of the product and freight charges to deliver the
    product to the company’s warehouses and are net of certain
    cash or non-cash consideration received from vendors (see
    “Vendor Consideration”).

Plant and
    Equipment

Capital additions, improvements and major replacements are
    classified as plant and equipment and are carried at cost.
    Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which
    reduces the book value of each asset in equal amounts over its
    estimated useful life, and is included within operating expenses
    in the consolidated results of operations. Maintenance, repairs
    and minor replacements are charged to earnings when they are
    incurred. Upon the disposition of an asset, its accumulated
    depreciation is deducted from the original cost, and any gain or
    loss is reflected in current earnings.

Certain internal and external costs related to the acquisition
    and development of internal use software being built within our
    Business Transformation Project are capitalized within plant and
    equipment during the application development stages of the
    project. This project is primarily in the development stage as
    of July 2, 2011 and no material depreciation has occurred.

Applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of
    new facilities and development of software for internal use are
    capitalized as one of the elements of cost and are amortized
    over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Interest
    capitalized for the past three fiscal years was
    $13.9 million in fiscal 2011, $10.0 million in fiscal
    2010 and $3.5 million in fiscal 2009.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows
    expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated
    over the asset’s useful life based on updated projections
    on an undiscounted basis. If the evaluation indicates that the
    carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, the
    potential impairment is measured at fair value.



Goodwill and
    Intangibles

Goodwill and intangibles represent the excess of cost over the
    fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Goodwill and
    intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Goodwill is
    assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit
    from the synergies of a business combination. The recoverability
    of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is assessed
    annually, or more frequently as needed when events or changes
    have occurred that would suggest an impairment of carrying
    value, by determining whether the fair values of the applicable
    reporting units exceed their carrying values. The reporting
    units used to assess goodwill impairment are the company’s
    eight operating segments as described in Note 19,
    “Business Segment Information.” The components within
    each of the eight operating segments have similar economic
    characteristics and therefore are aggregated into eight
    reporting units. The evaluation of fair value requires the use
    of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future
    performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash
    flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and
    earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable
    acquisitions.

Intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over their useful lives, which generally range from three
    to ten years. Management reviews finite-lived intangibles for
    indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the
    finite-lived intangibles are estimated over the intangible
    asset’s useful life based on updated projections on an
    undiscounted basis. If the evaluation indicates that the
    carrying value of the finite-lived intangible asset may not be
    recoverable, the potential impairment is measured at fair value.

Restricted
    Cash

Sysco is required by its insurers to collateralize a part of the
    self-insured portion of its workers’ compensation and
    liability claims. Sysco has chosen to satisfy these collateral
    requirements by depositing funds in insurance trusts or by
    issuing letters of credit. All amounts in restricted cash at
    July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010 represented funds
    deposited in insurance trusts.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

All derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities within
    the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Gains or losses
    on derivative financial instruments designated as fair value
    hedges are recognized immediately in the consolidated results of
    operations, along with the offsetting gain or loss related to
    the underlying hedged item.

Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated
    as cash flow hedges are recorded as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity at their settlement, whereby gains or
    losses are reclassified to the Consolidated Results of
    Operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying
    hedged item.

In the normal course of business, Sysco enters into forward
    purchase agreements for the procurement of fuel and electricity.
    Certain of these agreements meet the definition of a derivative.
    However, the company elected to use the normal purchase and sale
    exemption available under derivatives accounting literature;
    therefore, these agreements are not recorded at fair value.

Investments in
    Corporate-Owned Life Insurance

Investments in corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies
    are recorded at their cash surrender values as of each balance
    sheet date. Changes in the cash surrender value during the
    period are recorded as a gain or loss within operating expenses.
    The company does not record deferred tax balances related to
    cash surrender value gains or losses for the policies that Sysco
    has the intent to hold these policies to maturity. Deferred tax
    balances are recorded for those policies that Sysco intends to
    redeem prior to maturity. The total amounts related to the
    company’s investments in COLI policies included in other
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets were
    $231.3 million and $203.2 million at July 2, 2011
    and July 3, 2010, respectively.

Treasury
    Stock

The company records treasury stock purchases at cost. Shares
    removed from treasury are valued at cost using the average cost
    method.

Foreign Currency
    Translation

The assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries are
    translated at current exchange rates. Related translation
    adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss).

Revenue
    Recognition

The company recognizes revenue from the sale of a product when
    it is considered to be realized or realizable and earned. The
    company determines these requirements to be met at the point at
    which the product is delivered to the customer. The company
    grants certain customers sales incentives such as rebates or
    discounts and treats these as a reduction of sales at the time
    the sale is recognized. Sales tax collected from customers is
    not included in revenue but rather recorded as a liability due
    to the respective taxing authorities. Purchases and sales of
    inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
    contemplation of one another are considered to be a single
    nonmonetary transaction. As such, the company records the net
    effect of such transactions in the consolidated results of
    operations within sales.



Vendor
    Consideration

Sysco recognizes consideration received from vendors when the
    services performed in connection with the monies received are
    completed and when the related product has been sold by Sysco as
    a reduction to cost of sales. There are several types of cash
    consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the
    vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per
    case or per pound. In these instances, Sysco will recognize the
    vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the
    product is sold. In the situations in which the vendor
    consideration is not related directly to specific product
    purchases, Sysco will recognize these as a reduction of cost of
    sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service
    is performed and the amounts are realized.

Shipping and
    Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs include costs associated with the
    selection of products and delivery to customers. Included in
    operating expenses are shipping and handling costs of
    approximately $2,222.1 million in fiscal 2011,
    $2,103.3 million in fiscal 2010, and $2,136.8 million
    in fiscal 2009.

Insurance
    Program

Sysco maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of
    workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability and
    property insurance costs. The amounts in excess of the
    self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers.
    The company also maintains a fully self-insured group medical
    program. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated
    in part by considering historical claims experience, medical
    cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other
    actuarial assumptions.

Share-Based
    Compensation

Sysco recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based
    on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value
    of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option pricing methods
    require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
    the expected stock price volatility. The fair value of
    restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on
    the company’s stock price on the date of grant. Measured
    compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period
    of the related share-based compensation award. Cash flows
    resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) are
    classified as financing cash flows on the consolidated cash
    flows statements.

Income
    Taxes

Sysco recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
    the estimated future tax consequences attributable to
    differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
    existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax
    laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in
    the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
    allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
    assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.

Sysco recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
    when it is more likely than not that the position will be
    sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related
    appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits
    of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the
    largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than a 50%
    likelihood of being realized upon settlement. To the extent
    interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on
    any underpayment of income tax, estimated amounts required by
    the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions have
    been accrued and are classified as a component of income taxes
    in the consolidated results of operations.

The determination of the company’s provision for income
    taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and
    the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The
    company’s provision for income taxes primarily reflects a
    combination of income earned and taxed in the various
    U.S. federal and state, as well as various foreign
    jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or
    decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items,
    accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or
    valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix
    of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the
    overall effective tax rate.

Acquisitions

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting, and the financial statements include the
    results of the acquired operations from the respective dates of
    acquisition.

The purchase price of the acquired entities is allocated to the
    net assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the
    estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition, with any
    excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired,
    including intangibles, recognized as goodwill. The balances
    included in the consolidated balance sheets related to recent
    acquisitions are based upon preliminary information and are
    subject to change when final asset and liability valuations are
    obtained. Subsequent changes to the preliminary balances are
    reflected retrospectively, if material. Material changes to the
    preliminary allocations are not anticipated by management.



2.

CHANGES IN
    ACCOUNTING

Fair Value
    Measurements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements”, which was subsequently codified within
    Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, “Fair Value
    Measurements.” This standard established a common
    definition for fair value under generally accepted accounting
    principles, established a framework for measuring fair value and
    expanded disclosure requirements about such fair value
    measurements. As of June 29, 2008, Sysco adopted the
    provisions of this fair value measurement guidance for financial
    assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non-financial
    assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair
    value on a recurring basis. The adoption of the fair value
    measurement provisions for financial assets and liabilities
    carried at fair value and non-financial assets and liabilities
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring
    basis did not have a material impact on the company’s
    financial statements. As of June 28, 2009, Sysco adopted
    the provisions of this fair value measurements guidance for
    non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value. Sysco’s only
    non-recurring, non-financial asset fair value measurements are
    those used in its annual test of recoverability of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangibles, in which it determines whether
    estimated fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed
    their carrying values. The fair value measurements guidance was
    applied beginning in fiscal 2010 to this fair value estimation.

Disclosure About
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161,
    “Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,”
    which was subsequently codified within ASC 815,
    “Derivatives and Hedging”. Effective for Sysco in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009, this standard requires enhanced
    disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging
    activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial
    reporting. Sysco has provided the required disclosures for this
    standard in Note 8, “Derivative Financial
    Instruments.”

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”, which was subsequently
    codified as ASC 805, “Business Combinations.”
    This standard establishes principles and requirements for how an
    acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in a business combination. This standard
    also establishes recognition and measurement principles for the
    goodwill acquired in a business combination and disclosure
    requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the
    nature and financial effects of the business combination. In
    April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    No. FAS 141(R)-1, “Accounting for Assets and
    Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise From
    Contingencies”. This standard amended the previously issued
    business combinations guidance to address application issues
    raised by preparers, auditors, and members of the legal
    profession on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
    measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
    combination. Sysco adopted the provisions of these standards on
    a prospective basis for business combinations beginning in
    fiscal 2010.

Determining
    Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions
    Are Participating Securities

In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. EITF 03-06-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities”, which
    was subsequently codified within ASC 260, “Earnings
    Per Share.” This standard addresses whether instruments
    granted in share-based payment transactions are participating
    securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included
    in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under
    the two-class method. This standard was effective for Sysco
    beginning in fiscal 2010 and interim periods within that year.
    All prior-period earnings per share data presented in filings
    subsequent to adoption must be adjusted retrospectively to
    conform to the provisions of this standard. Early application of
    this standard was not permitted. The adoption of this standard
    did not have a material impact on the company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Measuring
    Liabilities at Fair Value

In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

2009-05,

“Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value”. This update
    provides additional guidance, including illustrative examples,
    clarifying the measurement of liabilities at fair value. This
    update is effective for the first reporting period beginning
    after its issuance. The company adopted the provisions of this
    update in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption of
    this update did not have a material impact on the company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Improving
    Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

2010-06,

“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.”
    This update requires some new disclosures and clarifies some
    existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements
    codified within ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures.” The majority of the provisions of this
    update, including those applicable to Sysco, were effective for
    interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
    December 15, 2009. Early application of the provisions of
    this update was permitted. The company adopted the applicable
    provisions of this update in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
    The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on
    the company’s consolidated financial statement disclosures.



Subsequent
    Events

In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update

2010-09,

“Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure
    Requirements.” This update amends ASC 855,
    “Subsequent Events” to remove the requirement for SEC
    filers to disclose the date through which subsequent events have
    been evaluated. In addition, the update clarifies the reissuance
    disclosure provision related to subsequent events. The update is
    effective immediately for financial statements that are issued
    or revised. The company adopted the provisions of this update in
    the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Because this update affects
    the disclosure and not the accounting treatment for subsequent
    events, the adoption of this provision did not have a material
    impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Employers’
    Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    No. FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
    about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets”, which was
    subsequently codified within ASC 715,
    “Compensation — Retirement Benefits”. This
    standard requires additional disclosures about assets held in an
    employer’s defined benefit pension or other postretirement
    plan and became effective for Sysco in fiscal 2010. Sysco has
    provided the required disclosures for this standard in
    Note 12, “Employee Benefit Plans.”

3.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS

Amendments to
    Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure
    Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs

In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update

2011-04,

“Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and
    Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.” This
    update amends ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement”
    to improve the comparability of fair value measurements
    presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. In addition, the
    update explains how to measure fair value, but does not require
    additional fair value measurements and is not intended to
    establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices
    outside of financial reporting. This update is effective for
    interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2011,
    which is the third quarter of fiscal 2012 for Sysco. The
    amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively and
    early application of this standard is not permitted. Sysco is
    currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU

2011-04

will
    have on its consolidated financial statements.

Presentation of
    Comprehensive Income

In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update

2011-05,

“Presentation of Comprehensive Income.” This update
    amends ASC 220, “Comprehensive Income” to
    eliminate the option to present components of other
    comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in
    stockholders’ equity. The amendments require that all
    nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented
    either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income

FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date
    (i.e. an exit price). The accounting guidance includes a fair
    value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
    techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of the
    fair value hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level

1 — Unadjusted quoted prices for
    identical assets or liabilities in active markets;

•

Level 2

— Inputs other than quoted prices
    in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are
    observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability; and

•

Level 3

— Unobservable inputs for the
    asset or liability, which include management’s own
    assumption about the assumptions market participants would use
    in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about
    risk.

Sysco’s policy is to invest in only high-quality
    investments. Cash equivalents primarily include time deposits,
    certificates of deposit, commercial paper, high-quality money
    market funds and all highly liquid instruments with original
    maturities of three months or less. Short-term investments
    consist of commercial paper with original maturities of greater
    than three months but less than one year. These investments are
    considered

available-for-sale

and are recorded at fair value. As of July 3, 2010, the
    difference between the fair value of the short-term investments
    and the original cost was not material. There were no short-term
    investments as of July 2, 2011. Restricted cash consists of
    investments in high-quality money market funds.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies
    used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

•

Time deposits, certificates of deposit and commercial paper
    included in cash equivalents are valued at amortized cost, which
    approximates fair value. These are included within cash
    equivalents as a Level 2 measurement in the tables below.



•

Commercial paper included in short-term investments is valued
    using broker quotes that utilize observable market inputs. These
    are included as a Level 2 measurement in the tables below.

•

Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by
    the fund sponsor from an actively traded exchange. These are
    included within cash equivalents and restricted cash as
    Level 1 measurements in the tables below.

•

The interest rate swap agreements, discussed further in
    Note 8, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” are
    valued using a swap valuation model that utilizes an income
    approach using observable market inputs including interest
    rates, LIBOR swap rates and credit default swap rates. These are
    included as a Level 2 measurement in the tables below.

The following tables present the company’s assets measured
    at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 2, 2011 and
    July 3, 2010:

The carrying values of accounts receivable and accounts payable
    approximated their respective fair values due to the short-term
    maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Sysco’s
    total debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for
    the same or similar issue or on the current rates offered to the
    company for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair
    value of total debt approximated $2,919.4 million and
    $2,774.9 million as of July 2, 2011 and July 3,
    2010, respectively. The carrying value of total debt was
    $2,668.5 million and $2,480.6 million as of
    July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, respectively.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired
    position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest
    rate swaps from time to time to achieve this position. The
    company does not use derivative financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes.

In September 2009, the company entered into an interest rate
    swap agreement that effectively converted $200.0 million of
    fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 to floating rate debt.
    In October 2009, the company entered into an interest rate swap
    agreement that effectively converted $250.0 million of
    fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 to floating rate debt.
    Both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing
    overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate
    exposure. These transactions were designated as fair value
    hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value
    of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates.

The location and the fair value of derivative instruments in the
    consolidated balance sheet as of each fiscal year-end are as

Hedge ineffectiveness represents the difference between the

    changes in fair value of the fixed rate debt attributable to
    changes in the benchmark interest rate. Hedge ineffectiveness is
    recorded directly in earnings within interest expense and was
    immaterial for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. The interest rate
    swaps do not contain a credit-risk-related contingent feature.

SELF-INSURED
    LIABILITIES

Sysco maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of
    workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability and
    property insurance costs. The amounts in excess of the
    self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers.

Short-term
    Borrowings

As of July 2, 2011, Sysco had uncommitted bank lines of
    credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working
    capital of up to $95.0 million. As of July 3, 2010,
    Sysco had uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for
    unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to
    $88.0 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under
    these lines of credit as of July 2, 2011 or July 3,
    2010, respectively.

As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the
    company’s Irish subsidiary, Pallas Foods Limited, had a
    €10.0 million (Euro) committed facility for unsecured
    borrowings for working capital. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under this facility as of July 2, 2011 or
    July 3, 2010.

On June 30, 2011, a Canadian subsidiary of Sysco entered
    into a short-term demand loan facility for the purpose of
    facilitating a distribution from the Canadian subsidiary to
    Sysco, and Sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the
    bank to guarantee the loan. As of July 2, 2011,



the amount outstanding under the facility was
    $182.0 million. The interest rate under the facility was
    2.0% and payable on the due date. The loan was repaid in full on
    July 4, 2011.

Commercial Paper
    and Revolving Credit Facility

Sysco has a Board-approved commercial paper program allowing the
    company to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate
    amount not to exceed $1,300.0 million.

Sysco and one of its subsidiaries, Sysco International, ULC.,
    have a revolving credit facility supporting the company’s
    U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs. The facility
    in the amount of $1,000.0 million expires on
    November 4, 2012, but is subject to extension.

During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, aggregate outstanding
    commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged
    from approximately zero to $330.3 million, zero to
    $1.8 million, and zero to $165.0 million,
    respectively. There were no commercial paper issuances
    outstanding as of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010,
    respectively.

Fixed Rate
    Debt

In February 2009, Sysco deregistered the securities remaining
    unsold under its then existing shelf registration statement that
    was filed with the SEC in February 2008 for the issuance of debt
    securities. In February 2009, Sysco filed with the SEC an
    automatically effective well-known seasoned issuer shelf
    registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate
    amount of debt securities that may be issued from time to time.

In March 2009, Sysco issued 5.375% senior notes totaling
    $250.0 million due March 17, 2019 (the 2019 notes) and
    6.625% senior notes totaling $250.0 million due
    March 17, 2039 (the 2039 notes) under its February 2009
    shelf registration. The 2019 and 2039 notes, which were priced
    at 99.321% and 98.061% of par, respectively, are unsecured, are
    not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a
    redemption provision which allows Sysco to retire the notes at
    any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued
    interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders
    are not penalized by early redemption. Proceeds from the notes
    will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate
    purposes, which may include acquisitions, refinancing of debt,
    working capital, share repurchases and capital expenditures.

The 4.20% senior notes due February 12, 2013,
    4.60% senior notes due March 15, 2014, the
    5.25% senior notes due February 12, 2018, the
    5.375% senior notes due September 21, 2035 and the
    6.5% debentures due August 1, 2028 are unsecured, are
    not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a
    redemption provision that allows Sysco to retire the debentures
    and notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par
    plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the
    debenture and note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

The 7.16% debentures due April 15, 2027 are unsecured,
    are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and are no
    longer redeemable prior to maturity.

The 6.10% senior notes due June 1, 2012, issued by
    Sysco International, Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sysco now
    known as Sysco International, ULC, are fully and unconditionally
    guaranteed by Sysco Corporation, are not subject to any sinking
    fund requirement, and include a redemption provision which
    allows Sysco International, ULC. to retire the notes at any time
    prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or
    an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not
    penalized by the early redemption.

Sysco’s Industrial Revenue Bonds have varying structures.
    Final maturities range from four to 15 years and certain of
    the bonds provide Sysco the right to redeem the bonds at various
    dates. These redemption provisions generally provide the
    bondholder a premium in the early redemption years, declining to
    par value as the bonds approach maturity.

Total
    Debt

Total debt as of July 2, 2011 was $2,668.5 million of
    which approximately 75% was at fixed rates with a weighted
    average of 5.9% and an average life of 15 years, and the
    remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 2.1%
    and an average life of one year. Certain loan agreements contain
    typical debt covenants to protect note holders, including
    provisions to maintain the company’s long-term debt to
    total capital ratio below a specified level. Sysco is currently
    in compliance with all debt covenants.

Other

As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010 letters of credit
    outstanding were $23.0 million and $28.4 million,
    respectively.

11.

LEASES

Sysco has obligations under capital and operating leases for
    certain distribution facilities, vehicles and computers. Total
    rental expense under operating leases was $79.3 million,
    $80.7 million, and $83.7 million in fiscal 2011, 2010
    and 2009, respectively. Contingent rentals, subleases and assets
    and obligations under capital leases are not significant.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
    PLANS

Sysco has defined benefit and defined contribution retirement
    plans for its employees. Also, the company contributes to
    various multi-employer plans under collective bargaining
    agreements and provides certain health care benefits to eligible
    retirees and their dependents.

Sysco maintains a qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan) that
    pays benefits to employees at retirement, using formulas based
    on a participant’s years of service and compensation.

The company’s defined contribution 401(k) plan provides
    that under certain circumstances the company may make matching
    contributions of up to 50% of the first 6% of a
    participant’s compensation. Sysco’s expense related to
    this plan was $19.8 million in fiscal 2011,
    $22.8 million in fiscal 2010, and $30.2 million in
    fiscal 2009.

Sysco’s contributions to multi-employer pension plans,
    which include payments for voluntary withdrawals, were
    $32.8 million, $51.5 million, and $48.0 million
    in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Payments for
    voluntary withdrawals included in contributions were
    approximately zero, $17.4 million and $15.0 million in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See further discussion
    of Sysco’s participation in multi-employer pension plans in
    Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies.”

In addition to receiving benefits upon retirement under the
    company’s Retirement Plan, participants in the Management
    Incentive Plan (see “Management Incentive
    Compensation

”

in Note 15, “Share-Based
    Compensation”) will receive benefits under a Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). This plan is a nonqualified,
    unfunded supplementary retirement plan.

Funded

In order to meet a portion of its obligations under the SERP,
    Sysco maintains life insurance policies on the lives of the
    participants with carrying values of $170.0 million as of
    July 2, 2011 and $149.5 million as of July 3,
    2010. These policies are not included as plan assets or in the
    funded status amounts in the tables above and below. Sysco is
    the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies. The projected
    benefit obligation for the SERP of $402.0 million and
    $363.5 million as of July 2, 2011 and July 3,
    2010, respectively, was included in Other long-term liabilities
    on the balance sheet.

Net company-sponsored pension costs increased $60.3 million
    in fiscal 2011 due primarily to a decrease in discount rates
    used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related
    pension expense, partially offset by reduced amortization of
    expense from actuarial gains from higher returns on assets of
    Sysco’s Retirement Plan during fiscal 2010. Net
    company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2012 are expected to
    decrease by approximately $27.3 million over fiscal 2011
    due primarily to higher returns on assets of Sysco’s
    Retirement Plan during fiscal 2011.

Employer
    Contributions

The company made cash contributions to its company-sponsored
    pension plans of $161.7 million and $297.9 million in
    fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. The contributions in
    fiscal 2011 of $140.0 million to the Retirement Plan would
    normally have been made in fiscal 2012; there were no minimum
    required contributions for the calendar 2010 plan year to meet
    ERISA minimum funding requirements. The contributions in fiscal
    2010 of $280.0 million to the Retirement Plan included the
    minimum required contribution for the calendar 2009 plan year to
    meet ERISA minimum funding requirements, as well as
    $140.0 million of contributions that would normally have
    been made in fiscal 2011. Additional contributions to the
    Retirement Plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal 2012,
    however we will evaluate our funding position at the end of
    fiscal 2012 and select the timing for a contribution at that
    time. The company’s contributions to the SERP and other
    post-retirement plans are made in the amounts needed to fund
    current year benefit payments. The estimated fiscal 2012
    contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other
    postretirement plans are $23.1 million and
    $0.3 million, respectively.

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit
    obligations as of year-end were:

For determining the benefit obligations as of July 2, 2011
    and July 3, 2010, the SERP calculations utilized an
    age-graded salary growth assumption.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net
    company-sponsored pension costs and other postretirement benefit
    costs for each fiscal year were:




Discount rate — Retirement Plan

For determining the net pension costs related to the SERP for
    fiscal 2011, the SERP calculations utilized an age-graded salary
    growth assumption. The calculation for fiscal 2010 utilized an
    age-graded salary growth assumption with reductions taken for
    determining fiscal 2010 pay due to base salary freezes in effect
    for fiscal 2010. The calculation for fiscal 2009 assumed various
    levels of base salary increase and decrease for determining pay
    for fiscal 2009 depending upon the participant’s position
    with the company and a 7% salary growth assumption for all
    participants for fiscal 2010 and thereafter.

A healthcare cost trend rate is not used in the calculations of
    postretirement benefit obligations because Sysco subsidizes the
    cost of postretirement medical coverage by a fixed dollar
    amount, with the retiree responsible for the cost of coverage in
    excess of the subsidy, including all future cost increases.

For guidance in determining the discount rate, Sysco calculates
    the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of
    high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and
    amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of
    the company-sponsored pension plans. The discount rate
    assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed
    appropriate. The discount rate to be used for the calculation of
    fiscal 2012 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the
    Retirement Plan is 5.94%. The discount rate to be used for the
    calculation of fiscal 2012 net company-sponsored benefit
    costs for the SERP is 5.93%. The discount rate to be used for
    the calculation of fiscal 2012 net company-sponsored
    benefit costs for the Other Postretirement Plans is 5.94%.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption
    is net return on assets assumption, representing gross return on
    assets less plan expenses. The expected return is derived from a
    mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the
    various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of
    rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward-looking
    views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, the
    historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on
    alternative investments. The rate of return assumption is
    reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The
    expected long-term rate of return to be used in the calculation
    of fiscal 2012 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the
    Retirement Plan is 7.75%.

Plan
    Assets

Investment
    Strategy

The company’s overall strategic investment objectives for
    the Retirement Plan are to preserve capital for future benefit
    payments and to balance risk and return commensurate with
    ongoing changes in the valuation of plan liabilities. In order
    to accomplish these objectives, the company oversees the
    Retirement Plan’s investment objectives and policy design,
    decides proper plan asset class strategies and structures,
    monitors the performance of plan investment managers and
    investment funds and determines the proper investment allocation
    of pension plan contributions and withdrawals. The company has
    created an investment structure for the Retirement Plan that
    takes into account the nature of the Retirement Plan’s
    liabilities. This structure ensures the Retirement Plan’s
    investment are diversified within each asset class, in addition
    to being diversified across asset classes with the intent to
    build asset class portfolios that are structured without
    strategic bias for or against any subcategories within each
    asset class. The company has also created a set of investment
    guidelines for the Retirement Plan’s investment managers to
    specify prohibited transactions, including borrowing of money
    except for real estate portfolios or private equity portfolios
    where leverage is a key component of the investment strategy and
    permitted in the investments’ governing documents, the
    purchase of securities on margin unless fully collateralized by
    cash or cash equivalents or short sales, pledging, mortgaging or
    hypothecating of any securities except for loans of securities
    that are fully collateralized, market timing transactions and
    the direct purchase of the securities of Sysco or the investment
    manager. The purchase or sale of derivatives for speculation or
    leverage is also prohibited; however, investment managers are
    allowed to use derivative securities so long as they do not
    increase the risk profile or leverage of the manager’s
    portfolio.



The company’s target and actual investment allocation as of
    July 2, 2011 is as follows:

Target Asset

Actual Asset

Allocation Range

23-31

%

Core fixed income

6-12


Alternative investments

5-15



%

Sysco’s investment strategy is implemented through a
    combination of balanced and specialist investment managers,
    passive investment funds and actively-managed investment funds.
    U.S. equity consists of both large-cap and

small-to-mid-cap

securities. Core fixed income investments include intermediate
    range U.S. government and agency securities, corporate
    bonds from diversified industries, asset-backed securities,
    mortgage-backed securities, other debt securities and derivative
    securities. Long duration fixed income investments include
    U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds from
    diversified industries, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed
    securities, other debt securities and derivative securities.
    High yield fixed income consists of below investment grade
    corporate debt securities and may include derivative securities.
    Alternative investments may include private equity, private real
    estate, timberland, and commodities investments. Investment
    funds are selected based on each fund’s stated investment
    strategy to align with Sysco’s overall target mix of
    investments. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and
    periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered
    appropriate. As of July 2, 2011, actual asset allocation
    varied from the stated target in certain categories, as
    alternative investment funding, primarily in private equity
    funds require contributions over a multi-year period. Until such
    capital is required, the company has chosen to invest these
    amounts in U.S. equities.

As discussed above, the Retirement Plan’s investments in
    equity, fixed income and alternative investments provide a range
    of returns and also expose the plan to investment risk. However,
    the investment policies put in place by the company require
    diversification of plan assets across issuers, industries and
    countries. As such, the Retirement Plan does not have
    significant concentrations of risk in plan assets.

Fair Value of
    Plan Assets

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date
    (i.e. an exit price). See Note 3, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” for a description of the fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
    used to measure fair value. The following is a description of
    the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities
    measured at fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents:

Valued at amortized
    cost, which approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents
    is included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Equity securities:

Valued at the closing price
    reported on the exchange market. If a stock is not listed on a
    public exchange, such as an American Depository Receipt or some
    preferred stocks, the stock is valued using an evaluated bid
    price based on a compilation of observable market information.
    Inputs used include yields, the underlying security “best
    price”, adjustments for corporate actions and exchange
    prices of underlying and common stock of the same issuer. Equity
    securities valued at the closing price reported on the exchange
    market are classified as a Level 1 measurement in the table
    below; all other equity securities are included as a
    Level 2 measurement.

Fixed income securities:

Valued using
    evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market
    information or a broker quote in a non-active market. Inputs
    used vary by type of security, but include spreads, yields, rate
    benchmarks, rate of prepayment, cash flows, rating changes and
    collateral performance and type. All fixed income securities are
    included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Investment funds:

Valued at the net asset
    value (NAV) provided by the manager of each fund. The NAV is
    calculated as the underlying net assets owned by the fund,
    divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is based on
    the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund. The
    real estate fund is valued at the NAV of shares held by the
    Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the
    underlying real estate investments held by the fund. Each real
    estate investment is valued on the basis of a discounted cash
    flow approach. Inputs used include future rental receipts,
    expenses and residual values from a market participant view of
    the highest and best use of the real estate as rental property.
    All investment funds, with the exception of the real estate fund
    and private equity funds, are included as a Level 2
    measurement in the table below. The real estate fund and private
    equity funds are included as Level 3 measurements.

Derivatives:

Valuation method varies by type
    of derivative security.

•

Credit default and interest rate swaps:

Valued
    using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable
    market information. Inputs used for credit default swaps include
    spread curves and trade data about the credit quality of the
    counterparty. Inputs used for interest rate swaps include
    benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, and
    interdealer broker rates. Credit default and interest rate swaps
    are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

•

Foreign currency contracts:

Valued using a
    standardized interpolation model that utilizes the quoted prices
    for standard-length forward foreign currency contracts and
    adjusts to the remaining term outstanding on the contract being
    valued. Foreign currency contracts are included as a
    Level 2 measurement in the table below.



•

Futures and option contracts:

Valued at the
    closing price reported on the exchange market for
    exchange-traded futures and options.

Over-the-counter

options are valued using pricing models that are based on
    observable market information. Exchange-traded futures and
    options are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table
    below;

over-the-counter

options are included as a Level 2 measurement.

The following table presents the fair value of the Retirement
    Plan’s assets by major asset category as of July 2,

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net
    earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common
    stock outstanding for each respective year. Diluted earnings per
    share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
    those respective years adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock
    options outstanding using the treasury stock method.

A reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the
    basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the
    periods presented follows:

Dividends declared were $604.5 million, $585.7 million
    and $557.5 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Included in dividends declared for each year were
    dividends declared but not yet paid at year-end of approximately
    $155.0 million, $148.0 million and $142.0 million
    in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

COMPREHENSIVE
    INCOME

Comprehensive income is net earnings plus certain other items
    that are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity, such as
    foreign currency translation adjustments, amounts related to
    cash flow hedging arrangements and certain amounts related to
    pension and other postretirement plans. The amortization of the
    cash flow hedge noted in the tables below relates to a cash flow
    hedge of a forecasted debt issuance which was settled in
    September 2005 and is being amortized over the life of the
    related debt. Comprehensive income was $1,372.3 million,
    $977.7 million and $846.7 million in fiscal 2011, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and
    non-employee directors under several share-based payment
    arrangements including various employee stock option plans, the
    Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive
    Plan and various non-employee director plans.

Stock Incentive
    Plans

In November 2009, Sysco’s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan was
    amended and provides for the issuance of up to
    55,000,000 shares of Sysco common stock for share-based
    awards to officers and other employees of the company. Of the
    55,000,000 authorized shares, the full 55,000,000 shares
    may be issued as options or stock appreciation rights and up to
    10,000,000 shares may be issued as restricted stock,
    restricted stock units or other types of stock-based awards. To
    date, Sysco has issued options, restricted stock and restricted
    stock units under this plan. Vesting requirements for awards
    under this plan will vary by individual grant and may include
    either time-based vesting or time-based vesting subject to
    acceleration based on performance criteria for fiscal periods of
    at least one year. The contractual life of all options granted
    under this plan will be no greater than seven years. As of
    July 2, 2011, there were 24,814,016 remaining shares
    authorized and available for grant in total under the amended
    2007 Stock Incentive Plan, of which the full
    24,814,016 shares may be issued as options or stock
    appreciation rights, or as a combination of up to
    8,667,189 shares that may be issued as restricted stock,
    restricted stock units or other types of stock-based awards with
    the remainder available for issuance as options or stock
    appreciation rights.

Sysco has also granted employee options under several previous
    employee stock option plans for which previously granted options
    remain outstanding as of July 2, 2011. No new options will
    be issued under any of the prior plans, as future grants to
    employees will be made through the amended 2007 Stock Incentive
    Plan or subsequently adopted plans. Vesting requirements for
    awards under these plans vary by individual grant and include
    either time-based vesting or time-based vesting subject to
    acceleration based on performance criteria. The contractual life
    of all options granted under these plans through July 3,
    2004 is 10 years; options granted after July 3, 2004
    have a contractual life of seven years.

In November 2009, Sysco’s 2009 Non-Employee Directors Stock
    Plan was adopted and provides for the issuance of up to
    750,000 shares of Sysco common stock for share-based awards
    to non-employee directors. The authorized shares may be granted
    as restricted stock, restricted stock units, elected shares or
    additional shares. In addition, options and unvested common
    shares also remained outstanding as of July 2, 2011 under
    previous non-employee director stock plans. No further grants
    will be made under these previous plans, as all future grants to
    non-employee directors will be made through the 2009
    Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan or subsequently adopted plans.
    Vesting requirements for awards under these plans vary by
    individual grant and include either time-based vesting or
    vesting based on performance criteria. The contractual life of
    all options granted under these plans through July 3, 2004
    is 10 years; options granted after July 3, 2004 have a
    contractual life of seven years. As of July 2, 2011, there
    were 652,097 remaining shares authorized and available for grant
    in total under the 2009 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan.

Stock
    Options

Certain of Sysco’s option awards are subject to graded
    vesting over a service period. In those cases, Sysco recognizes
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. In other cases, certain of
    Sysco’s option awards provide for graded vesting over a
    service period but include a performance-based provision
    allowing for accelerated vesting. In these cases, if it is
    probable that the performance condition will be met, Sysco
    recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the
    shorter performance period; otherwise, it will recognize
    compensation cost over the longer service period.

In addition, certain of Sysco’s options provide that the
    options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an
    employee or director if the optionee meets certain age and years
    of service thresholds upon retirement. In these cases, for
    awards granted through July 2, 2005, Sysco will recognize
    the compensation cost for such awards over the service period
    and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when
    the employee retires. Due to the adoption of the fair value
    recognition provisions of the stock compensation accounting
    guidance, for awards granted subsequent to July 2, 2005,
    Sysco will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the
    period from the grant date to the date the employee or director
    first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to
    vest after retirement. If Sysco had recognized compensation cost
    for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date
    the employee or the director first became eligible to retire
    with the options continuing to vest after retirement for all
    periods presented, recognized compensation cost would not have
    been materially different for fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010.
    Recognized compensation cost would have been $3.5 million
    lower for fiscal 2009.

The fair value of each option award is estimated as of the date
    of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    weighted average assumptions for the periods indicated are noted
    in the following table. Expected volatility is based on
    historical volatility of Sysco’s stock, implied
    volatilities from traded options on Sysco’s stock and other
    factors. Sysco utilizes historical data to estimate option
    exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation
    model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical
    exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation
    purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based on the
    historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price



for the year preceding the option grant. The risk-free rate for
    the expected term of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The following weighted-average assumptions were used for each
    fiscal year presented:

The total number of employee options granted was 7,190,250,
    8,494,200 and 8,089,750 in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. During fiscal 2011, 1,423,000 options were granted
    to 11 executive officers and 5,767,250 options were granted to
    approximately 1,500 other key employees. During fiscal 2010,
    1,451,500 options were granted to 12 executive officers and
    7,042,700 options were granted to approximately 1,600 other key
    employees. During fiscal 2009, 1,395,000 options were granted to
    12 executive officers and 6,694,750 options were granted to
    approximately 1,700 other key employees.

The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $3.96, $4.53 and $5.88,
    respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
    during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $45.5 million,
    $16.3 million and $24.4 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock
    Units

During fiscal 2011 and 2010, 656,000 and 652,300 restricted
    stock units, respectively, were granted to employees that will
    vest ratably over a three-year period. The majority of these
    restricted stock units were granted with dividend equivalents.
    The fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with
    a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price
    as of the date of grant. For restricted stock unit awards
    granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value was reduced
    by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting
    period. The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of
    restricted stock units granted during the fiscal 2011 and 2010
    was $28.72 and $27.24, respectively.

Restricted
    Stock

In fiscal 2009, 75,822 shares of restricted stock were
    granted to an executive officer. The fair value of these shares
    was $23.74 per share, which was based on the stock price on the
    grant date. These shares will vest ratably over a three-year
    period. In fiscal 2010, this executive officer announced his
    retirement, and 37,911 of the shares were forfeited according to
    the terms of the agreement. The remaining shares have vested
    according to the terms of the agreement as amended in connection
    with the executive officer’s retirement.

Non-Employee
    Director Awards

The 2009 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan, as well as previous
    plans, provides for the issuance of restricted awards to current
    non-employee directors. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    60,973, 58,310 and 65,631 shares, respectively, of
    restricted awards were granted to non-employee directors. The
    awards granted in fiscal 2011 vest over a one-year period, and
    the awards granted in fiscal 2010 and 2009 vest over a
    three-year period. Beginning in fiscal 2011, the non-employee
    directors may elect to receive these awards in restricted stock
    shares that will vest at the end of the award’s stated
    vesting period or as deferred units which convert into shares of
    Sysco common stock upon a date selected by the non-employee
    director that is subsequent to the award’s stated vesting
    date. The fair value of the restricted awards is based on the
    company’s stock price as of the date of grant. The weighted
    average grant-date fair value of the shares granted during
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $28.87, $27.44 and $24.99,
    respectively.

Under the 2009 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan, non-employee
    directors may elect to receive up to 100% of their annual
    directors’ fees in Sysco common stock on either an annual
    or deferred basis. Previous plans allowed for the election to
    receive up to 50% of annual directors’ fees in Sysco common
    stock. Sysco provides a matching grant of 50% of the number of
    shares received for the stock election subject to certain
    limitations. As a result of such elections, a total of 27,979,
    23,111 and 21,966 shares with a weighted-average grant date
    fair value of $29.26, $24.42 and $27.49 per share were issued in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in the form of fully
    vested common stock or deferred units.

Employees’
    Stock Purchase Plan

Sysco has an Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan that permits
    employees to invest in Sysco common stock by means of periodic
    payroll deductions at discount of 15% from the closing price on
    the last business day of each calendar quarter. In November
    2010, the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan was amended to
    reserve an additional 5,000,000 shares of Sysco common
    stock for issuance under the plan. Including the additional
    5,000,000 shares reserved in fiscal 2011, the total number
    of shares which may be sold pursuant to the plan may not exceed
    79,000,000 shares, of which 6,902,496 remained available as
    of July 2, 2011.

During fiscal 2011, 1,655,100 shares of Sysco common stock
    were purchased by the participants as compared to
    1,827,386 shares purchased in fiscal 2010 and
    2,031,695 shares purchased in fiscal 2009. In July 2011,
    377,730 shares were purchased by participants.

    Plan was $4.28, $3.87 and $3.85 per share during fiscal 2011,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of the stock
    purchase rights was calculated as the difference between the
    stock price at date of issuance and the employee purchase price.

Management
    Incentive Compensation

Sysco’s Management Incentive Plan compensates key
    management personnel for specific performance achievements. With
    respect to bonuses for fiscal 2008 and earlier years, the
    bonuses earned and expensed under this plan were paid in the
    following fiscal year in both cash and stock or deferred for
    payment in future years at the election of each participant. The
    stock awards under this plan immediately vested upon issuance;
    however, participants were restricted from selling,
    transferring, giving or otherwise conveying the shares for a
    period of two years from the date of issuance of such shares.
    The fair value of the stock issued under the Management
    Incentive Plan was based on the stock price less a 12% discount
    for post-vesting restrictions. The discount for post-vesting
    restrictions was estimated based on restricted stock studies and
    by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option
    over the restriction period. In May 2008, the Management
    Incentive Plan was amended to remove the stock component of the
    bonus structure from all future bonuses granted. A total of
    672,087 shares at a fair value of $28.22 were issued
    pursuant to this plan in fiscal 2009 for bonuses earned in the
    fiscal 2008, the final year the bonus included a stock component.

All Share-Based
    Payment Arrangements

The total share-based compensation cost that has been recognized
    in results of operations was $59.2 million,
    $66.4 million and $56.0 million for fiscal 2011, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, and is included within operating
    expenses in the consolidated results of operations. The total
    income tax benefit recognized in results of operations for
    share-based compensation arrangements was $18.2 million,
    $13.9 million and $9.9 million for fiscal 2011, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

As of July 2, 2011, there was $61.3 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based
    compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.62 years.

Cash received from option exercises and purchases of shares
    under the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan was
    $332.7 million, $94.8 million and $111.8 million
    during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The actual tax
    benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises
    totaled $15.9 million, $5.4 million and
    $7.4 million during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

The deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net

    arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts
    of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
    the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Internal Revenue
    Service Settlement

Sysco’s affiliate, Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative (BSCC),
    was a cooperative taxed under subchapter T of the United States
    Internal Revenue Code, the operation of which has resulted in a
    deferral of tax payments. The IRS, in connection with its audits
    of the company’s 2003 through 2006 federal income tax
    returns, proposed adjustments that would have accelerated
    amounts that the company had previously deferred and would have
    resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts.
    Sysco reached a settlement with the IRS in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010 to cease paying U.S. federal taxes related to
    BSCC on a deferred basis, pay the amounts that were recorded
    within deferred taxes related to BSCC over a three-year period
    and make a one-time payment of $41.0 million, of which
    approximately $39.0 million was non-deductible. The
    settlement addressed the BSCC deferred tax issue as it related
    to the IRS audit of the company’s 2003 through 2006 federal
    income tax returns, and settled the matter for all subsequent
    periods, including the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns
    already under audit. As a result of the settlement, the company
    agreed to pay the amounts owed in the following schedule:

As noted in the table above, payments related to the settlement
    were $212.0 million and $528.0 million in fiscal 2011
    and fiscal 2010, respectively. Remaining amounts to be paid in
    2012 will be paid in connection with the company’s
    quarterly tax payments, two of which fall in the second quarter,
    one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter. The
    company believes it has access to sufficient cash on hand, cash
    flows from operations and current access to capital to make
    payments on all of the amounts noted above. The company had
    previously accrued interest for a portion of the exposure
    pertaining to the IRS proposed adjustments and as a result of
    the settlement with the IRS, Sysco recorded an income tax
    benefit of approximately $29.0 million in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010.

Sysco’s deferred taxes were impacted by the timing of these
    installment payments. Sysco reclassified amounts due within one
    year from deferred taxes to accrued income taxes at the
    beginning of each of fiscal 2011 and 2010. Additionally,
    beginning in fiscal 2009, the company is not deferring taxes for
    federal purposes according to its agreement with the IRS.

The company had state net operating tax loss carryforwards as of

    carryforwards as of July 3, 2010. The net operating tax
    loss carryforwards outstanding as of July 2, 2011 expire in
    fiscal years 2012 through 2031. There were no valuation
    allowances recorded for the state tax loss carryforwards as of
    July 2, 2011 because management believes it is more likely
    than not that these benefits will be realized based on
    utilization forecasts. Valuation allowances of
    $19.8 million were recorded for the state tax loss
    carryforwards as of July 3, 2010, as management believed
    that it was more likely than not that a portion of the benefits
    of these state tax loss carryforwards would not be realized.

The effective tax rate of 36.96% for fiscal 2011 was favorably
    impacted primarily by two items. First, the company recorded a
    tax benefit of approximately $17.0 million for the reversal
    of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net
    operating loss carryforwards. Second, the company adjusted the
    carrying values of the company’s COLI policies to their
    cash surrender values. The gain of $28.2 million recorded
    in fiscal 2011 was primarily non-taxable for income tax
    purposes, and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense
    for the period by $11.1 million. Partially offsetting these
    favorable impacts was the recording of $9.3 million in tax
    and interest related to various federal, foreign and state
    uncertain tax positions.

The effective tax rate of 36.20% for fiscal 2010 was favorably
    impacted primarily by two items. First, as discussed above, the
    company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately
    $29.0 million resulting from the one-time reversal of
    previously accrued interest related to the settlement with the
    IRS. Second, the gain of $21.6 million recorded to adjust
    the carrying value of COLI policies to their cash surrender
    values in fiscal 2010 was non-taxable for income tax purposes,
    and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the
    period by $8.3 million.

The effective tax rate of 40.37% for fiscal 2009 was unfavorably
    impacted primarily by two factors. First, the company recorded
    tax adjustments related to federal and state uncertain tax
    positions of $31.0 million. Second, the loss of
    $43.8 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of COLI
    policies to their cash surrender values in fiscal 2009 was
    non-deductible for income tax purposes, and had the impact of
    increasing income tax expense for the period by
    $16.8 million. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was
    favorably impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances of
    $7.8 million previously recorded on Canadian net operating
    loss deferred tax assets.

As of July 2, 2011, $15.9 million of the gross
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits was netted within
    prepaid income taxes relating to a payment that occurred during
    fiscal 2011; however, the liability is considered outstanding
    until the matters have been settled with the respective
    jurisdiction. As of July 2, 2011, the gross amount of
    liability for accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits was $33.2 million, of which
    $8.7 million was netted within prepaid income taxes
    relating to a payment that occurred during fiscal 2011; however,
    the liability is considered outstanding until the matters have
    been settled with the respective jurisdiction. The expense
    recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in fiscal 2011 was $7.2 million.

As of July 3, 2010, $15.9 million of the gross
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits was netted within
    prepaid income taxes as payment was expected to occur during
    fiscal 2011. As of July 3, 2010, the gross amount of
    liability for accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits was $40.6 million, of which
    $8.7 million was netted within prepaid income taxes as
    payment was expected to occur during fiscal 2011. The expense
    recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in fiscal 2010 was $12.0 million.

If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits
    recorded as of July 2, 2011, approximately
    $40.1 million of the $72.1 million reserve would
    reduce the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that
    the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to
    certain of the company’s unrecognized tax positions will
    increase or decrease in the next twelve months either because
    Sysco’s positions are sustained on audit or because the
    company agrees to their disallowance. Items that may cause
    changes to unrecognized tax benefits primarily include the
    consideration of various filing requirements in various states
    and the allocation of income and expense between tax
    jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits recognized within the next twelve months may decrease
    due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain
    years in various jurisdictions; however, it is possible that a
    jurisdiction may open an audit on one of these years prior to
    the statute of limitations expiring. At this time, an estimate
    of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.

The IRS is auditing Sysco’s 2009 and 2010 federal income
    tax returns. As of July 2, 2011, Sysco’s tax returns
    in the majority of the state and local jurisdictions and Canada
    are no longer subject to audit for the years before 2006.
    However, some jurisdictions have audits open prior to 2006, with
    the earliest dating back to 2002. Certain tax jurisdictions
    require partial to full payment on audit assessments in order to
    proceed to the appeals process. Although the outcome of tax
    audits is generally uncertain, the company believes that
    adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have
    been accrued for any adjustments that may result from those open
    years.

Other

Undistributed income of certain consolidated foreign
    subsidiaries at July 2, 2011 amounted to
    $544.0 million for which no deferred U.S. income tax
    provision has been recorded because Sysco intends to permanently
    reinvest such income in those foreign operations. An estimate of
    any U.S. taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may be
    applicable upon actual or deemed repatriation is not practical.

17.

ACQUISITIONS

During fiscal 2011, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of
    $101.1 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2011
    and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired
    in previous fiscal years. During fiscal 2011, Sysco acquired for
    cash broadline foodservice operations in central California; Los
    Angeles, California; Ontario, Canada; Lincoln, Nebraska and
    Trenton, New Jersey. The fiscal 2011 acquisitions were
    immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, to the
    consolidated financial statements.

Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically
    payable over periods up to five years only in the event that
    certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. As of
    July 2, 2011, aggregate contingent consideration amounts
    outstanding relating to acquisitions was $56.6 million, of
    which $46.0 million could result in the recording of
    additional goodwill.

18.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

Legal
    Proceedings

Sysco is engaged in various legal proceedings which have arisen
    but have not been fully adjudicated. Management does not believe
    that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect upon
    the consolidated financial position or results of operations of
    the company. However, the final results of legal proceedings
    cannot be predicted with certainty and if the company failed to
    prevail in one or more of these legal matters, the
    company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations could be materially adversely affected in future
    periods.



Multi-Employer
    Pension Plans

Sysco contributes to several multi-employer defined benefit
    pension plans based on obligations arising under collective
    bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees.
    Approximately 10% of Sysco’s current employees are
    participants in such multi-employer plans. In fiscal 2011, total
    contributions to these plans were approximately
    $32.8 million.

Sysco does not directly manage these multi-employer plans, which
    are generally managed by boards of trustees, half of whom are
    appointed by the unions and the other half by other employers
    contributing to the plan. Based upon the information available
    from plan administrators, management believes that several of
    these multi-employer plans are underfunded. In addition,
    pension-related legislation, requires underfunded pension plans
    to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals
    based on the level of their underfunding. As a result, Sysco
    expects its contributions to these plans to increase in the
    future.

Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, Sysco’s voluntary
    withdrawal, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers
    from any underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would
    require Sysco to make payments to the plan for Sysco’s
    proportionate share of the multi-employer plan’s unfunded
    vested liabilities. Generally, Sysco does not have the greatest
    share of liability among the participants in any of the plans in
    which it participates. Based on the information available from
    plan administrators, which has valuation dates ranging from
    January 31, 2009 to December 31, 2009, Sysco estimates
    its share of withdrawal liability on most of the multi-employer
    plans in which it participates could have been as much as
    $200.0 million as of July 2, 2011, based on a
    voluntary withdrawal. This estimate excludes plans for which
    Sysco has recorded withdrawal liabilities. The majority of the
    plans Sysco participates in have a valuation date of calendar
    year-end. As such, the majority of the estimated withdrawal
    liability results from plans for which the valuation date was
    December 31, 2009; therefore, the company’s estimated
    liability reflects the asset losses incurred by the financial
    markets as of that date. Due to the lack of current information,
    management believes Sysco’s current share of the withdrawal
    liability could materially differ from this estimate. In
    addition, if a multi-employer defined benefit plan fails to
    satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the IRS may impose
    a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of the
    accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing
    to the fund.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the union members of one of
    the company’s subsidiaries voted to withdraw from the
    union’s multi-employer pension plan and join Sysco’s
    company-sponsored Retirement Plan. This action triggered a
    partial withdrawal from the multi-employer pension plan. As a
    result, during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Sysco recorded
    a withdrawal liability provision of approximately
    $36.1 million related to this plan. Sysco has experienced
    other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from
    multi-employer pension plans. Total withdrawal liability
    provisions recorded include $41.5 million in fiscal 2011,
    $2.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $9.6 million in fiscal
    2009. As of July 2, 2011, Sysco had approximately
    $42.4 million in liabilities recorded related to certain
    multi-employer defined benefit plans for which Sysco’s
    voluntary withdrawal had already occurred, which includes the
    liability recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Recorded
    withdrawal liabilities are estimated at the time of withdrawal
    based on the most recently available valuation and participant
    data for the respective plans; amounts are adjusted up to the
    period of payment to reflect any changes to these estimates. If
    any of these plans were to undergo a mass withdrawal, as defined
    by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, within a two year
    time frame from the point of our withdrawal, Sysco could have
    additional liability. The company does not currently believe any
    mass withdrawals are probable to occur in the applicable two
    year time frame relating to the plans from which Sysco has
    voluntarily withdrawn.

During fiscal 2008, the company obtained information that a
    multi-employer pension plan it participated in failed to satisfy
    minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded
    that it was probable that additional funding would be required
    as well as the payment of excise tax. As a result, during fiscal
    2008, Sysco recorded a liability of approximately
    $16.5 million related to its share of the minimum funding
    requirements and related excise tax for these periods. During
    the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Sysco effectively withdrew
    from this multi-employer pension plan in an effort to secure
    benefits for Sysco’s employees that were participants in
    the plan and to manage the company’s exposure to this
    under-funded plan. Sysco agreed to pay $15.0 million to the
    plan, which included the minimum funding requirements. In
    connection with this withdrawal agreement, Sysco merged
    participants from this plan into its company-sponsored
    Retirement Plan and assumed $26.7 million in liabilities.
    The payment to the plan was made in the second quarter of fiscal
    2009.

Fuel
    Commitments

Sysco routinely enters into forward purchase commitments for a
    portion of its projected diesel fuel requirements. As of
    July 2, 2011, we had forward diesel fuel commitments
    totaling approximately $85.6 million through June 2012.

Other
    Commitments

Sysco has committed to product purchases for resale in order to
    leverage the company’s purchasing power. A majority of
    these agreements expire within one year; however, certain
    agreements have terms through fiscal 2013. These agreements
    commit the company to a minimum volume at various pricing terms,
    including fixed pricing, variable pricing or a combination
    thereof. Minimum amounts committed to as of July 2, 2011
    totaled approximately $949.3 million. Minimum amounts
    committed to by year are as follows: $858.0 million in
    fiscal 2012 and $91.3 million in fiscal 2013.

Sysco has committed with a third party service provider to
    provide hardware and hardware hosting services. The services are
    to be provided over a ten year period beginning in fiscal 2005
    and ending in fiscal 2015. The total cost of the services over
    that period is expected to be approximately $553.4 million.
    This amount may be reduced by Sysco utilizing less than
    estimated resources and can be increased by Sysco



utilizing more than estimated resources and the adjustments for
    inflation provided for in the agreements. Sysco may also cancel
    a portion or all of the services provided subject to termination
    fees which decrease over time. If Sysco were to terminate all of
    the services in fiscal 2012, the estimated termination fee
    incurred in fiscal 2012 would be approximately
    $13.6 million.

19.

BUSINESS SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

The company has aggregated its operating companies into a number
    of segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable
    segments as defined in the accounting literature related to
    disclosures about segments of an enterprise. The Broadline
    reportable segment is an aggregation of the company’s
    United States, Canadian and European Broadline segments.
    Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food
    products and a wide variety of non-food products to its
    customers. SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of
    food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain
    chain restaurant customer locations. “Other” financial
    information is attributable to the company’s other
    operating segments, including the company’s specialty
    produce and lodging industry segments and a company that
    distributes to international customers.

Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the
    company’s custom-cut meat operations were reorganized to
    function as part of the United States Broadline segment. As a
    result, the custom-cut meat operations are included in the
    Broadline reportable segment in the segment reporting presented
    below. Previously, these operations were an independent segment
    and were presented with the “Other” financial
    information relating to non-reportable segments. Segment
    reporting for the comparable prior year periods has been revised
    to conform to the new classification of the custom-cut meat
    operations as part of the Broadline reportable segment.

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those
    disclosed by Sysco. Intersegment sales represent specialty
    produce products distributed by the Broadline and SYGMA
    operating companies. The segment results include certain
    centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to
    our segments. These centrally incurred costs are charged based
    upon the relative level of service used by each operating
    company consistent with how Sysco’s management views the
    performance of its operating segments. Management evaluates the

SUPPLEMENTAL
    GUARANTOR INFORMATION — PARENT GUARANTEE

Sysco International, ULC. is an unlimited liability company
    organized under the laws of the Province of British Columbia,
    Canada and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sysco. In May 2002,
    Sysco International, Co., now known as Sysco International ULC,
    issued, in a private offering, $200.0 million of
    6.10% notes due in 2012 (see Note 10,
    “Debt”). In December 2002, these notes were exchanged
    for substantially identical notes in an exchange offer
    registered under the Securities Act of 1933. These notes are
    fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco. Sysco
    International, ULC. is a holding company with no significant
    sources of income or assets, other than its equity interests in
    its subsidiaries and interest income from loans made to its
    subsidiaries. The proceeds from the issuance of the
    6.10% notes were used to repay commercial paper issued to
    fund the fiscal 2002 acquisition of a Canadian broadline
    foodservice operation.

The following condensed consolidating financial statements
    present separately the financial position, results of operations
    and cash flows of the parent guarantor (Sysco), the subsidiary
    issuer (Sysco International) and all other non-guarantor
    subsidiaries of Sysco (Other Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries) on a
    combined basis and eliminating entries.

Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Sysco’s management, with the participation of our chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    July 2, 2011. The term “disclosure controls and
    procedures,” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
    company that are designed to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
    the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    company’s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding the required disclosure. Management
    recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
    achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies
    its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
    possible controls and procedures. Sysco’s disclosure
    controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable
    assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on the evaluation
    of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 2,
    2011, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
    concluded that, as of such date, Sysco’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
    assurance level.

Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting is included in the financial statement pages at
    page 38.

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
    July 2, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
    likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
    reporting.
