PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions (collectively referred to as
“SYSCO” or the “company”), is the largest North American distributor of food and related products
primarily to the foodservice or “food-prepared-away-from-home” industry. Founded in 1969, SYSCO
provides its products and services to approximately 390,000 customers, including restaurants,
healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers.

SYSCO, which was formed when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for
SYSCO common stock, commenced operations in March 1970. Since its formation, the company has grown
from $115 million to over $30 billion in annual sales, both through internal expansion of existing
operations and through acquisitions. Through the end of fiscal 2005, SYSCO had acquired 130
companies or divisions of companies.

In May 2005, SYSCO acquired Facciola Meat Company, a specialty meat and seafood distributor

company’s executive offices are 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077-2099, (281) 584-1390.
This annual report on Form 10-K, as well as all other reports filed or furnished by SYSCO pursuant
to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge on
SYSCO’s website at

www.sysco.com

as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically
filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Operating Segments

SYSCO provides food and related products to the foodservice or “food-prepared-away-from-home”
industry. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” the company has aggregated
its operating companies into a number of segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable
segments as defined in SFAS No. 131. Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food
products and a wide variety of non-food products to both our traditional and chain restaurant
customers. SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of
non-food products to chain restaurant customer locations. “Other” financial information is
attributable to the company’s other segments, including the company’s specialty produce, custom-cut
meat, Asian cuisine foodservice and lodging industry products segments. The company’s specialty
produce companies distribute fresh produce and, on a limited basis, other foodservice products.
Specialty meat companies distribute custom-cut fresh steaks, other meat, seafood and poultry. Our
specialty Asian cuisine foodservice companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide
variety of non-food products to restaurants serving Asian cuisine. Our lodging industry products
company distributes personal care guest amenities, equipment, housekeeping supplies, room
accessories and textiles to the lodging industry. Selected financial data for each of the company’s
reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in
Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.



Customers and Products

The foodservice industry consists of two major customer types — “traditional” and “chain
restaurant.” Traditional foodservice customers include restaurants, hospitals, schools, hotels and
industrial caterers. SYSCO’s chain restaurant customers include regional and national hamburger,
sandwich, pizza, chicken, steak and other chain operations.

Services to the company’s traditional foodservice and chain restaurant customers are supported
by similar physical facilities, vehicles, material handling equipment and techniques, and
administrative and operating staffs.

Products distributed by the company include a full line of frozen foods, such as meats, fully
prepared entrees, fruits, vegetables and desserts, a full line of canned and dry foods, fresh
meats, imported specialties and fresh produce. The company also supplies a wide variety of non-food
items, including: paper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups; tableware such as
china and silverware; cookware such as pots, pans and utensils; restaurant and kitchen equipment
and supplies; and cleaning supplies. SYSCO’s operating companies distribute both nationally-branded
merchandise and products packaged under SYSCO’s private brands.

The company believes that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, close contact with customers
and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their
foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of products to
traditional customers. SYSCO’s operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer
locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice. Through the more
than 13,200 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of SYSCO and its operating
companies, SYSCO stays informed of the needs of its customers and acquaints them with new products
and services. SYSCO’s operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice
distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data, menu-planning
advice, food safety training and assistance in inventory control, as well as access to various
third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of SYSCO’s total sales for its fiscal year ended
July 2, 2005.

SYSCO’s sales to chain restaurant customers consist of a variety of food products. The company
believes that consistent product quality and timely and accurate service are important factors in
the selection of a chain restaurant supplier. One chain restaurant customer (Wendy’s International,
Inc.) accounted for 5% of SYSCO’s sales for its fiscal year ended July 2, 2005. Although this
customer represents approximately 39% of the SYGMA segment sales, the company does not believe that
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on SYSCO as a whole.

Based upon available information, the company estimates that sales by type of customer during
the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Hospitals and nursing homes

Sources of Supply

SYSCO purchases from thousands of suppliers, none of which individually accounts for more than
10% of the company’s purchases. These suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling
brand name and private label merchandise and independent regional brand and private label
processors and packers. Generally, purchasing is carried out through centrally developed purchasing
programs and direct purchasing programs established by the company’s various operating companies.
The company continually develops relationships with suppliers but has no material long-term
purchase commitments with any supplier.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, SYSCO began restructuring its supply chain. This
National Supply Chain project, which reorganizes SYSCO’s supply chain, involved the creation of the
Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative that handles product procurement, and also involves the construction
and operation of regional distribution centers which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize
the supply chain activities for certain products for all SYSCO operating companies in the region.
The company’s National Supply Chain project is intended to increase profitability by lowering
aggregate inventory levels, operating costs, and future facility expansion needs at SYSCO’s
operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers. The company
expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers over the next seven years. The
first of these centers, the Northeast Redistribution Center located in Front Royal, Virginia,
opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. As of August 2005, it was supplying products to 12
of the 14 broadline operating companies in the Northeast Region and is expected to be shipping
products to the remaining two operating companies in the Northeast Region by October 2005. The
company expects to begin construction of its second regional



redistribution facility, to be located in Alachua, Florida, in fiscal 2006. The third
regional redistribution center is planned to be located in the Midwest Region.

The Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative administers a consolidated product procurement program
designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food and non-food products. The program
covers the purchasing and marketing of SYSCO Brand merchandise as well as products from a number of
national brand suppliers, encompassing substantially all product lines. The operating companies can
choose to purchase product from the suppliers participating in the cooperative’s programs or from
other suppliers, but SYSCO Brand products are only available through the cooperative’s programs.

Working Capital Practices

SYSCO’s growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper
issuances and long-term borrowings. See the discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 regarding the company’s liquidity, financial
position and sources and uses of funds.

Credit terms extended by SYSCO to its customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or
more based on SYSCO’s assessment of the customers’ credit risk. SYSCO monitors the customers’
accounts and will suspend shipments to customers if necessary.

A majority of SYSCO’s sales are filled within 24 hours of when the customers’ orders are
placed. SYSCO will maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand. The level of
inventory on hand will vary by product depending on product shelf-life, supplier order fulfillment
lead times and customer demand. SYSCO also makes purchases of product based on supply or pricing
opportunities.

SYSCO takes advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally
receives payment terms from its suppliers. Payment terms received from suppliers range from weekly
to 30 days or more.

Corporate Headquarters’ Services

SYSCO’s corporate staff makes available a number of services to the company’s operating
companies. Members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in, among other areas,
accounting and finance, cash management, information technology, employee benefits, engineering and
insurance. The corporate office also makes available legal, marketing, payroll, human resources and
tax compliance services as well as warehousing and distribution services, which provide assistance
in space utilization, energy conservation, fleet management and work flow.

Capital Improvements

To maximize productivity and customer service, the company continues to construct and
modernize its distribution facilities. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately
$390,203,000, $530,086,000 and $435,637,000, respectively, were invested in facility expansions,
fleet additions and other capital asset enhancements. The company estimates its capital
expenditures in fiscal 2006 should be in the range of $425,000,000 to $450,000,000. During the
three years ended July 2, 2005, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally
generated funds, the company’s commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings. The company
expects to finance its fiscal 2006 capital expenditures from the same sources.

Employees

As of July 2, 2005, SYSCO and its operating companies had approximately 47,500 full-time
employees, approximately 18% of whom were represented by unions, primarily the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters. Contract negotiations are handled locally. Collective bargaining
agreements covering approximately 27% of the company’s union employees expire during fiscal 2006.
SYSCO considers its labor relations to be satisfactory. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,
the number of customer contact associates increased by almost 2% as compared to the number at the
end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The company intends to continue to increase the number of
customer contact associates in fiscal 2006.

Competition

The business of SYSCO is competitive with numerous companies engaged in foodservice
distribution. Foodservice operators may also choose to purchase products directly from retail
outlets. While competition is encountered primarily from local and regional distributors, a few
companies compete with SYSCO on a national basis. The company believes that the principal
competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts, the ability to
deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and
a competitive price. The company estimates that it serves about 14% of an approximately $210
billion annual market that includes the North American foodservice and hotel amenity, furniture and
textile markets. SYSCO



believes, based upon industry trade data, that its sales to the North American
“food-prepared-away-from-home” industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during
fiscal 2005. While adequate industry statistics are not available, the company believes that in
most instances its local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related non-food
products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas.

Government Regulation

As a marketer and distributor of food products, SYSCO is subject to the U.S. Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) and the Canadian Food and Drugs Act and the regulations thereunder.

The FDA regulates manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through its current good
manufacturing practice regulations, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods and
prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels.
For certain product lines, SYSCO is also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry
Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act
and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). The USDA
imposes standards for product quality and sanitation including the inspection and labeling of meat
and poultry products and the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from the
company’s suppliers. SYSCO is also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism
Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping
requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal
consumption.

In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency administers and enforces the food safety and
nutritional quality standards established by Health Canada under the Canadian Food and Drugs Act
and under other related federal legislation, including the Canada Agricultural Products Act, the
Meat Inspection Act, the Fish Inspection Act and the Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act (as it
relates to food). These laws regulate the processing, storing, grading, packaging, marking,
transporting and inspection of certain SYSCO product lines as well as the packaging, labeling,
sale, importation and advertising of pre-packaged and certain other products.

The company and its products are also subject to state, provincial and local regulation
through such measures as the licensing of its facilities, enforcement by state, provincial and
local health agencies of state, provincial and local standards for the company’s products and
regulation of the company’s trade practices in connection with the sale of its products. SYSCO’s
facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor, together with similar occupational health
and safety laws in each Canadian province, which require the company to comply with certain
manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect its employees from accidents and to establish
hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present
in products distributed by the company.

The company also is subject to regulation by numerous U.S. and Canadian federal, state,
provincial and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of
Labor and each Canadian provincial ministry of labour, which set employment practice standards for
workers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Canadian Transportation Agency, which
regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste, and similar state,
provincial and local agencies.

Most of the company’s distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and
tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws
regulating such systems and storage tanks. Other U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and
local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials do not
materially impact the company’s use or operation of its facilities.

Compliance with these laws has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect on the
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of SYSCO.

General

SYSCO has numerous trademarks which are of significant importance to the company. The loss of
the SYSCO(R) trademark would have a material adverse effect on SYSCO’s results of operations.

SYSCO is not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the
development of new products or the improvement of existing products.

Sales of the company do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis; therefore,
the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal.

As of July 2, 2005, SYSCO and its operating companies operated 170 facilities throughout the
United States and Canada, of which 160 were principal distribution facilities.

SYSCO owns approximately 460,967,000 cubic feet of its distribution facilities and self-serve
centers (or 80.4% of the total cubic feet), and the remainder is occupied under leases expiring at
various dates from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2040, exclusive of renewal options. Certain of the
facilities owned by the company are either subject to mortgage indebtedness or industrial revenue
bond financing arrangements totaling $19,510,000 at July 2, 2005. Such mortgage indebtedness and
industrial revenue bond financing arrangements mature at various dates through fiscal 2026.

The company owns its approximately 188,000 square foot headquarters office complex in Houston,
Texas and leases approximately 208,000 square feet of additional office space in Houston, Texas.
The company began the expansion of its headquarters office complex in fiscal 2006.

Facilities in Denver, Colorado; Lincoln, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; and Las Vegas, Nevada
(which in the aggregate accounted for approximately 2.5% of fiscal 2005 sales) are operating near
capacity and the company is currently constructing expansions or replacements for these
distribution facilities. New distribution facilities also are under construction in Geneva County,
Alabama; Lancaster, California; and Raleigh, North Carolina. The company expects to begin
construction of its second regional redistribution facility, to be located in Alachua, Florida, in
fiscal 2006.

As of July 2, 2005, SYSCO’s fleet of approximately 8,550 delivery vehicles consisted of
tractor and trailer combinations, vans and panel trucks, most of which are either wholly or
partially refrigerated for the transportation of frozen or perishable foods. The company owns
approximately 86% of these vehicles and leases the remainder.

factors. In July 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the company to enter into agreements from
time to time to extend its ongoing repurchase program to include repurchases during company
announced “blackout periods” of such securities in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

On November 23, 2004, the company entered into a stock purchase plan with Bank of America
Securities LLC to purchase up to 10 million shares of SYSCO common stock as authorized under the
September 2003 repurchase program pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. A
total of 10 million shares were purchased during the period between November 29, 2004 and May 6,
2005, including during company “blackout” periods. By its terms, the agreement terminated on May
6, 2005.

On May 27, 2005, the company entered into a stock purchase plan with Bank of New York to
purchase up to 10 million shares of SYSCO common stock as authorized under the February 2005
repurchase program pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. A total of
6,975,000 shares were purchased between June 1, 2005 and August 16, 2005, including during company
“blackout” periods. By its terms, the agreement terminated on August 16, 2005.

As of August 27, 2005, no shares remained available for repurchase under the September 2003
repurchase program, and there were 10,443,700 shares remaining available for repurchase under the
February 2005 repurchase program.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Highlights

Sales increased 3.2% in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 included 52 weeks, as
compared to fiscal 2004 which included an additional 53

rd

week. After adjusting for the
additional week in fiscal 2004, sales increased 5.3% in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 adjusted sales
(See the reconciliation of fiscal 2004 actual sales to fiscal 2004 adjusted sales in “

Sales”

under
“Results of Operations”). Gross margins as a percent of sales for fiscal 2005 decreased from the
prior year due to the impact of product cost increases and changes in customer mix and segment mix.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales for fiscal 2005 decreased from the prior year due to
operating efficiencies, operating costs increasing at lower rates than sales price increases,
reduced performance-based management incentive compensation and decreased net pension costs, which
overcame increased fuel costs and increased expenses incurred on the National Supply Chain project.
The income tax provision in fiscal 2005 includes a tax benefit of $8.5 million primarily related to
the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss
carryforwards and a tax benefit of $11 million related to the reversal of a tax contingency
accrual. The comparison of fiscal 2005’s net earnings to fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted
by the additional 53

rd

week in fiscal 2004. Primarily as a result of these factors, net
earnings for fiscal 2005 increased 6.0% over the prior year.

Management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs, together with general
economic conditions, including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending, contributed
to a softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of SYSCO’s sales growth beginning in the
latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and continuing into the first half of fiscal 2005.
After adjusting for the additional week in last year’s fourth quarter, sales growth remained
relatively stable over the course of fiscal 2005. Management believes that the declining rate of
product cost increases over the course of fiscal 2005 has lessened the overall gross margin
pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth experienced
in the latter half of fiscal 2005. Additionally, management believes that the maturation of the
company’s business review process has contributed to unit sales growth.

The company continues to focus on customer account penetration and expense controls, including
managing personnel expenses, improving productivity and ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best
practices at the operating companies.

Overview

SYSCO distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational
facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. SYSCO’s operations are located
throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce
companies, custom-cut meat operations, Asian cuisine foodservice operations, hotel supply
operations, and SYGMA, the company’s chain restaurant distribution subsidiary.

The company estimates that it serves about 14% of an approximately $210 billion annual market
that includes the North American foodservice and hotel amenity, furniture and textile markets.
According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-prepared-away-from-home, market represents
approximately one-half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level.
This share grew from about 37% in 1972 to its current level in 1998.

General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency and amount spent
by consumers for food-prepared-away-from-home and in turn can impact SYSCO’s sales. SYSCO
historically has grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and has grown its market share in
this fragmented industry.

The company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through
strategies which include:

•

Sales growth: The company plans to grow sales by gaining an increased share of products
purchased by existing customers, development of new customers, the use of foldouts (new
operating companies created in established markets previously served by other SYSCO
operating companies) and a disciplined acquisition program. The company uses market
information to estimate the potential sales and profitability of new and existing customers.
Marketing resources, SYSCO Brand products and value-added services provided by SYSCO can be
custom-tailored to the purchasing needs of customers. Additionally, the investment of
resources in any particular account can be made in proportion to the account’s potential
profitability.

•

Brand management: SYSCO Brand products are manufactured by suppliers to meet SYSCO’s
product specifications using strict quality assurance standards. SYSCO believes that SYSCO
Brand products generally provide higher profitability than national brand products to SYSCO.
SYSCO believes that SYSCO Brand products also provide a greater value to SYSCO’s customers
and differentiate SYSCO from its customers.



•

Productivity gains: The company’s investment in warehousing and transportation
technology and the implementation of best business practices allows SYSCO to leverage
operating expenses relative to sales growth.

•

Sales force effectiveness: The company invests in the development and expansion of its
customer contact resources by hiring additional customer contact personnel through targeted
recruiting, hiring and promotion practices, effective use of training programs and improved
compensation systems. Expanded business review and business development functions allow the
sales force to strengthen customer relationships and increase sales.

•

Supply chain management: The company’s National Supply Chain project and related
organization is being developed to reduce total supply chain costs, operating costs and
working capital requirements of the company.

The company’s National Supply Chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain
activities for products for SYSCO’s operating companies in each respective region and as a result,
increase profitability and lower inventory and operating costs, working capital requirements and
future facility expansion needs at SYSCO’s operating companies while providing greater value to our
suppliers and customers. The company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution
centers in the United States over the next seven years. The first of these centers, the Northeast
Redistribution Center located in Front Royal, Virginia, opened during the third quarter of fiscal
2005. As of August 2005, it was supplying products to 12 of the 14 broadline operating companies
in the Northeast Region and is expected to be shipping products to the remaining two operating
companies in the Northeast Region by October 2005. The company expects to begin construction of
its second regional redistribution facility, to be located in Alachua, Florida, in fiscal 2006.

The expenses related to the National Supply Chain project in the first quarter of fiscal 2006
are expected to be approximately equal to expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 or about
$15 million. During the first half of fiscal 2006, the ramp-up phase of the Northeast
Redistribution Center will be completed. It is anticipated that the majority of benefits that will
be realized in fiscal 2006 from the Northeast Redistribution Center will be realized during the
second half of fiscal 2006 as this is when the Northeast Redistribution Center is expected to be
operating at full volume.

Hurricane Katrina

Hurricane Katrina principally impacted our operating companies in Jackson, Mississippi and New
Orleans, Louisiana as well as causing many of our customers in the New Orleans and Mississippi Gulf
Coast area to be closed. The impacted operations in Jackson have recovered and service to
customers has been restored. SYSCO’s facility in New Orleans sustained only minor damage from the storm
but remained closed after the storm due to conditions in New Orleans. The facility has recently
resumed partial operations; however, most of the orders received from customers of the New Orleans
facility that are open for business have been temporarily rerouted to other nearby SYSCO facilities
for fulfillment and delivery until the New Orleans facility has been restored to full capacity. We
are still assessing the impact of Hurricane Katrina on our operations in the areas affected by the
storm; however, we do not expect this occurrence to have a material adverse effect on SYSCO’s
financial position or fiscal 2006’s operating results as a whole.

Sales

Sales for fiscal 2005 were 3.2% greater than fiscal 2004, or 5.3% greater after adjusting for
the additional week in fiscal 2004. Sales for fiscal 2004 were 12.2% greater than fiscal 2003, or
10.0% greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004. Because the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2003, sales growth
for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 are not directly comparable. In order to provide a more
comparable picture of sales growth, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales
figures for fiscal 2004 by the estimated impact of the additional week. As a result, sales for
fiscal 2004 presented in the table below are adjusted by one-fourteenth of total sales for the
fourth quarter. Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth
for the periods presented:

Acquisitions contributed 0.8% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 0.9% for fiscal
2004. SYSCO generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers; however, the actual
amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify. Estimated product
cost increases were 3.5% during fiscal 2005 as compared to 6.3% during fiscal 2004.

Management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs together with general
economic conditions, including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending, contributed
to the softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of SYSCO’s sales growth beginning in
the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and continuing into the first half of fiscal
2005.



After adjusting for the additional week in last year’s fourth quarter, sales growth remained
relatively stable over the course of fiscal 2005. Management believes that the declining rate of
product cost increases over the course of fiscal 2005 has lessened the overall gross margin
pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth in the
latter half of fiscal 2005. Additionally, management believes that the maturation of the company’s
business review process has contributed to unit sales growth.

The company also continues its focus on profitable sales growth. One part of this strategy
involves being more selective with respect to which customers we serve, including improving the
profitability of, or ultimately exiting, unprofitable customers and refining the use of customer
purchasing potential and profitability data in targeting new customers. The company continues to
see reductions in sales to unprofitable customers over the comparable prior year periods. In
addition, the number of customer contact personnel increased almost 2% in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005 as compared to the number at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The company
intends to continue to increase the number of customer contact associates in fiscal 2006.

Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of
approximately 2.4% in calendar year 2004 and real sales decline of approximately 0.1% in calendar
year 2003.

Gross Margins

Gross margins as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal 2005 when compared to the prior
year. Management believes that this gross margin decline was caused by several factors, including
product cost increases, changes in segment mix, customer mix and pricing pressure. Product cost
increases in most of the product categories had the impact of reducing gross margins as a
percentage of sales, as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollar base. The decline
in gross margins as a percent of sales slowed during the course of fiscal 2005 due in part to a
lessening of the rate of product cost increases during the fiscal year.

Gross margins as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal 2004 when compared to the prior
year. Management believes that gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 were impacted
by several factors, including product cost increases, changes in customer mix, segment mix and
product mix and pricing pressure.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as
selling, administrative and occupancy expenses. Changes in the percentage relationship of operating
expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors, including improved efficiencies,
customer mix, and product cost increases which result in increases in sales prices.

The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2005 as compared to
fiscal 2004 was aided by improved operating efficiencies. For example, the Broadline segment
continues to demonstrate improving trends in key expense metrics, including miles driven per trip,
pieces per stop and pieces per error. Increases in product costs and the resulting increased
average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating
costs increased at a lower rate.



Operating expenses were negatively impacted by increased costs to deliver product to customers
due to increased fuel costs of approximately $31,000,000 in fiscal 2005 over the prior year.
Operating expenses related to the National Supply Chain project were $46,450,000 in fiscal 2005, as
compared to $29,333,000 in fiscal 2004. Also included in operating expenses was the recognition of
a gain of $13,803,000 in fiscal 2005 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their
cash surrender value, as compared to a gain of $19,124,000 in fiscal 2004. Operating expenses were
favorably impacted by a reduction of management performance based incentive bonuses of $26,989,000
and a decrease in net pension cost of $7,374,000 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004.

The decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003
was attributable to several factors including improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by
improving trends in key expense metrics tracked at the broadline operating companies, including
pieces sold per delivery, product line items sold per delivery, pieces per trip and pieces per
error. Increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also
favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate.
Operating expenses were negatively impacted by increases in net pension costs of $39,944,000 and by
increases in expenses related to the National Supply Chain project of $5,584,000 over fiscal 2003.
Also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a gain of $19,124,000 in fiscal 2004 to
adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value, as compared to a
loss of $156,000 in fiscal 2003.

In order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs, SYSCO from time to
time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of SYSCO’s projected monthly diesel
fuel requirements. Forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of July 2, 2005 were
not material.

Interest Expense

The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2005 was due to increased borrowing interest rates.
The increase in the company’s overall borrowing interest rates was primarily due to an increase in
the percentage of the company’s debt with fixed interest rates in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal
2004. In fiscal 2004, the company’s debt portfolio included a larger percentage of floating rate
debt in the form of either commercial paper issuances or fixed rate debt converted to floating
through interest rate swap agreements. In addition, market interest rates have increased during
fiscal 2005.

The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower borrowing interest
rates offsetting moderately higher borrowing levels. The lower average borrowing rates of the
company in fiscal 2004 were due to lower short-term market interest rates and the use of interest
rate swaps which converted the fixed rates of interest on a portion of SYSCO’s long term debt to
lower variable rates of interest.

Other, Net

Changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities, primarily
gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 36.97% in fiscal 2005, 38.50% in fiscal 2004 and 38.25% in fiscal
2003. The income tax provision in fiscal 2005 includes a tax benefit of $8,500,000 primarily
related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating
loss carryforwards and a tax benefit of $11,000,000 related to the reversal of a tax contingency
accrual.

Net Earnings

Fiscal 2005 represents the twenty-ninth consecutive year of increased earnings before the
cumulative effect of accounting changes. The increases were due to the factors discussed above. In
addition, the comparison of fiscal 2005’s net earnings to fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by
the additional 53

rd

week in fiscal 2004.

Earnings Per Share

The increases in earnings per share were the result of factors discussed above, as well as a
net reduction of shares outstanding due primarily to share repurchases.

Return on Average Shareholders’ Equity

The return on average shareholders’ equity was approximately 35% in fiscal 2005, 39% in fiscal
2004 and 36% in fiscal 2003. The higher return in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the impact of
minimum pension liability adjustments to shareholders’ equity. Since its inception, SYSCO has averaged approximately 20% return on average shareholders’ equity.

Broadline Segment

Acquisitions contributed 0.1% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 0.2% in
fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 sales growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing
associate-served customers and multi-unit customers, including increased sales of SYSCO Brand
products and increases in both sales prices and unit volumes. The comparison of fiscal 2005 sales
to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004.

The fiscal 2004 sales growth was due to increased sales to marketing associate-served
customers and multi-unit customers, including increased sales of SYSCO Brand products, and price
increases resulting from higher product costs. The additional week also contributed to the sales
growth in fiscal 2004. The sales growth in fiscal 2005 and 2004 was obtained through increased
sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new customers.

The decrease of Broadline segment sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales in fiscal 2005
was due primarily to strong sales growth in the SYGMA and other segments outpacing the Broadline
sales growth, as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty
produce and SYGMA operations during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. The decrease of Broadline segment
sales as a percentage of total SYSCO sales in fiscal 2004 was due primarily to strong sales growth
in the SYGMA and other segments outpacing the Broadline sales growth, as well as the contribution
to sales growth from the acquisition of the Asian cuisine foodservice operations during fiscal
2003.

Marketing associate-served sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the U.S. increased to
53.8% in fiscal 2005 as compared to 53.5% in fiscal 2004. SYSCO Brand sales as a percentage of
broadline sales in the U.S. decreased to 49.4% for fiscal 2005 as compared to 49.5% in fiscal 2004.

The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increases in
sales and increased operating efficiencies aided by lower expenses as a percentage of sales.
Factors contributing to the lower expenses as a percentage of sales were reduced performance based
management incentive compensation and decreased net periodic pension costs, which overcame higher
fuel costs and increased expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project. The comparison
of fiscal 2005’s earnings before income taxes to fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted by the
additional 53

rd

week in fiscal 2004.

The increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to
increased sales and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales, which more than offset reduced
margins as a percentage of sales. The additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in
fiscal 2004.



SYGMA Segment

Acquisitions contributed 2.6% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 1.9% in
fiscal 2004. The comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the
additional week in fiscal 2004. Both the fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 sales growth was due primarily
to sales to new customers, sales growth in SYGMA’s existing customer base related to new locations
added by those customers, as well as increases in sales to existing locations, price increases
resulting primarily from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions. The additional
week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004.

The decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2005 was due to several factors.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005, SYGMA discontinued
servicing a portion of its largest customer’s locations due to that customer’s geographic supply
chain realignment. SYGMA offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from
this customer and obtaining new business from other customers. In many cases, this new business is
being served out of different SYGMA locations than those that originally served the discontinued
business. SYGMA opened a new facility to serve a portion of the new business which it began
serving in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 and throughout fiscal 2005, SYGMA’s operating profits have been impacted by increased
operating expenses as it transitioned its operations to serve the new business it has acquired. In
addition, SYGMA’s gross margins as a percent of sales in fiscal 2005 have declined from the
comparable period in fiscal 2004 due to product cost increases and lower agreed upon pricing with
its customers.

The increase in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the increased
sales offset by increased expenses incurred related to implementation of new systems, severance
payments related to certain personnel changes, costs related to worker’s compensation insurance
claims and pension costs. The additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal
2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

SYSCO provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily
throughout the United States and Canada. The company intends to continue to expand its market share
through profitable sales growth, foldouts and acquisitions. The company also strives to increase
the effectiveness of its customer contact personnel, its consolidated buying programs and the
productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities. These objectives require continuing
investment. SYSCO’s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from
financial markets.

SYSCO’s operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from
operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, fleet and
other equipment required to meet customers’ needs; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible with
the company’s overall growth strategy. Any remaining cash generated from operations may, at the
discretion of management, be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program,
while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long-term debt. SYSCO’s share
repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and
compensation plans, for acquisitions, to reduce shares outstanding (which may have the net effect
of increasing earnings per share) and to aid in managing the ratio of long-term debt to total
capitalization. Management targets a long-term debt to total capitalization ratio between 35% and
40%. The ratio may exceed the target range from time to time, due to borrowings incurred in order
to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities, and due to fluctuations in the timing and
amount of share repurchases. The ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow
from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases. This ratio was
33.1% and 35.2% at July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004, respectively. For purposes of calculating this
ratio, long-term debt includes both the current maturities and long-term portion.

In April 2005, SYSCO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration
statement covering $1,500,000,000 in debt securities. The registration statement was declared
effective in May 2005. In June 2005, SYSCO repaid the 6.5% senior notes totaling $150,000,000 at
maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In
July 2005, SYSCO also repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 at maturity also
utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. The company
intends to issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long-term
debt in September 2005. The amount of long-term debt that SYSCO
issues will depend upon market conditions at the time of issuance.
The proceeds from such issuance are
intended to be utilized to repay outstanding commercial paper issuances and for working capital
and general corporate purposes.

Also during the fall of 2005, the company intends to renegotiate its revolving bank credit
facility which supports the U.S. commercial paper program.



Operating Activities

Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by increases in inventory
balances of $35,014,000 and increases in accounts receivable balances of $72,829,000, partially
offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of $28,080,000. Cash flow from operations in
fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by increases in inventory balances of $162,502,000 and
increases in accounts receivable balances of $177,058,000, offset by an increase in accounts
payable balances of $95,874,000. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2003 was negatively impacted
by increases in inventory balances of $69,959,000 and increases in accounts
 receivable balances of $218,150,000, offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of
$237,360,000.

Also impacting cash flow from operations was a decrease in accrued expenses of $32,674,000 in
fiscal 2005, an increase in accrued expenses of $61,544,000 in fiscal 2004 and a decrease in
accrued expenses of $12,480,000 in fiscal 2003. The changes in accrued expenses in each year are
primarily due to the amount of accrued incentive bonuses related to that year.

Also impacting cash flow from operations were decreases in other long term liabilities and
prepaid pension cost of $86,338,000 in fiscal 2005, $35,056,000 in fiscal 2004 and $72,814,000 in
fiscal 2003. The decreases in other long-term liabilities and prepaid pension cost in each year are
primarily due to the amount of pension contributions exceeding the net pension cost recognized in
each year. The company’s contributions to its defined benefit plans were $220,361,000, $165,512,000
and $164,565,000 during fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Included in the
amounts contributed in fiscal 2005 was $134,000,000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified
pension plan in the fourth quarter. The decision to increase the contributions to the qualified
pension plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decreased discount rate, which increased the
pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 year-end pension funded status. The
company expects to contribute approximately $74,000,000 to its defined benefit plans in fiscal
2006.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the company began reorganizing its supply chain to
maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and
procurement functions performed for the benefit of customers. The structure results in the deferral
of certain federal and state income tax payments, as supply chain distributions are not included in
taxable income until distributed in periods subsequent to when they are recognized in book income.
Fiscal 2004 is the first period that supply chain distributions were included in taxable income
since the company began deferring these items for tax purposes in fiscal 2002. As a result of the
impact of these items and other temporary differences, including the utilization of net operating
loss carryforwards, excess tax depreciation and pension contributions, taxes paid during fiscal
2005 and 2004 increased to $436,378,000 and $344,414,000, respectively, as compared to $28,747,000
in fiscal 2003. The net cash flow impact of supply chain distribution deferrals in fiscal 2005 was
incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the
deferral, due to increased volume through this structure.

The amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2004 was reduced by $70,615,000 as the result of the
utilization of a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward. This net operating loss
carryforward was generated in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the deferral of supply chain
distributions.

Also impacting the amount of taxes paid in each year is the amount of deductible pension
contributions made in each year. As indicated above, the company expects that its pension
contributions in fiscal 2006 will be substantially less than the contributions made in the
preceeding three fiscal years.

Investing Activities

Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included the construction of fold-out facilities in Spokane,
Washington and Geneva, Alabama, replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Baltimore,
Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Miami, Florida; and Hartford,
Connecticut, and the completion of the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia.
Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures related to the National Supply Chain project were $34,009,000,
bringing the total amount of capital expenditures on the project since inception to $186,263,000.

Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures included the construction of fold-out facilities in Oxnard,
California and Fargo, North Dakota, replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Billings,
Montana; Cleveland, Ohio; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami, Florida; and San Antonio, Texas, and the
Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia as well as continued expenditures related
to the National Supply Chain project.

Fiscal 2003 capital expenditures included the construction of fold-out facilities in Las
Vegas, Nevada and Oxnard, California, replacement facilities in Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; and
Miami, Florida and the Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia.

Total expenditures in fiscal 2006 are expected to be in the range of $425,000,000 to
$450,000,000. Fiscal 2006 expenditures will include the continuation of the fold-out program;
facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; a corporate office expansion; the
company’s National Supply Chain project; and investments in technology.

During fiscal 2005, SYSCO acquired for cash one broadline foodservice operation, four custom
meat-cutting operations, and two specialty produce distributors. During fiscal 2004, SYSCO acquired
for cash certain assets of two broadline foodservice operations, a specialty produce distributor,
and one quickservice operation. During fiscal 2003, SYSCO acquired for cash a broadline foodservice
operation, two quickservice operations, a custom meat-cutting operation, a specialty distributor of
products to the Asian cuisine foodservice market and a distributor of paper and chemical products.



Financing Activities

The company routinely engages in Board-approved share repurchase programs. The number of
shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years was 16,790,200 shares for
$597,660,000 in fiscal 2005, 16,454,300 shares for $608,506,000 in fiscal 2004, and 16,500,000
shares for $478,471,000 in fiscal 2003. An additional 5,375,000 shares have been purchased at a
cost of $190,747,000 through August 27, 2005, resulting in 10,443,700 shares remaining available
for repurchase as authorized by the Board as of that date.

The company made four regular quarterly dividend payments during each of fiscal years 2005,
2004 and 2003. SYSCO began paying the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.15 per share in January
2005, an increase from the $0.13 per share that became effective in January 2004. In May 2005,
SYSCO declared its regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.15 per
share, which was paid in July 2005. In September 2005, SYSCO also declared its regular quarterly
dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.15 per share, payable in October 2005.

In November 2000, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf
registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time
in connection with acquisitions. As of August 27, 2005, 29,447,835 shares remained available for
issuance under this registration statement.

In June 1998, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf
registration statement covering $500,000,000 in debt securities. As of August 27, 2005,
$425,000,000 in debt securities had been issued under the registration statement, leaving
$75,000,000 available for issuance.

In March 2004, SYSCO issued 4.60% notes totaling $200,000,000 due March 15, 2014 in a private
offering. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire outstanding commercial paper.

In April 2005, SYSCO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration
statement covering $1,500,000,000 in debt securities. The registration statement was declared
effective in May 2005. In June 2005, SYSCO repaid the 6.5% senior notes totaling $150,000,000 at
maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In
July 2005, SYSCO repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a
combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. The company intends to
issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long-term debt in
September 2005. The amount of long-term debt that SYSCO issues will depend
on market conditions at the time of issuance. The proceeds from such
issuance are intended to be
utilized to repay outstanding commercial paper issuances and for working capital and general
corporate purposes.

In March 2005, SYSCO entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap with a notional amount
of $350,000,000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments
on the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The fair value of
the swap as of July 2, 2005 was ($32,584,000), which is reflected in Accrued expenses on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss, net of tax, in Other
comprehensive income.

SYSCO has uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for
working capital of up to $95,000,000, of which $31,000,000 was outstanding as of July 2, 2005 and
$33,200,000 was outstanding as of August 27, 2005.

SYSCO has a commercial paper program in the United States which is supported by a bank credit
facility in the amount of $450,000,000, maturing in fiscal 2008. SYSCO also has a commercial paper
program in Canada which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of CAD $100,000,000,
maturing in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, aggregate outstanding commercial paper
issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged from approximately $28,560,000 to $253,384,000,
$73,102,000 to $478,114,000, and $55,813,000 to $495,703,000, respectively. Outstanding commercial
paper issuances were $157,851,000 as of July 2, 2005 and $519,186,000 as of August 27, 2005.

Also during the fall of 2005, the company intends to renegotiate its revolving bank credit
facility which supports the U.S. commercial paper program.

From August 1, 2005 through August 27, 2005, outstanding commercial paper issuances have
averaged $511,847,000. This increased level of commercial paper issuances is primarily a result of
the repayment of the 6.5% senior notes and 4.75% senior notes, which matured June 15, 2005 and July
30, 2005, respectively, coupled with a contribution to the qualified pension plan of $134,000,000
at the end of fiscal 2005. As described above, the company intends to issue long-term debt in
September 2005. Until such time, SYSCO believes that outstanding commercial paper issuances will
continue at these current levels. The company expects to continue to meet its capital investment
and working capital requirements during this period. The company also believes that it continues
to have access to additional debt financing if needed.



Total debt at July 2, 2005 was $1,431,108,000, of which approximately 86% was at fixed rates
averaging 5.6% and the remainder
 was at floating rates averaging 3.2%. Included in current maturities of long-term debt at July
2, 2005 are the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000, which were repaid at maturity in July
2005, and the 7.0% senior notes totaling $200,000,000, which mature in May 2006.

As part of normal business activities, SYSCO issues letters of credit through major banking
institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements. As of July 2, 2005 and July 3,
2004, letters of credit outstanding were $76,817,000 and $11,001,000, respectively. The increase in
letters of credit outstanding from July 3, 2004 to July 2, 2005 was due primarily to the issuance
of a letter of credit in April 2005 in the amount of $72,000,000 to satisfy the collateral
requirement for an insurance agreement which was previously satisfied with funds on deposit in an
insurance trust.

In summary, management believes that the company’s cash flows from operations, as well as the
availability of capital under its existing commercial paper programs, bank lines of credit, debt
shelf registration and its ability to access capital from financial markets in the future, will be
sufficient to meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating
purposes.

For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of
product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed.
Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. Purchase obligations also
includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting
services (See discussion under Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8).

Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event
that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved.
Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of July 2, 2005 included approximately
1,059,000 shares of SYSCO’s common stock and $105,614,000 in cash. These amounts are not included
in the table above.



Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant
accounting policies employed by SYSCO are presented in the notes to the financial statements.

Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the
company’s financial condition and results of operations. These policies require management’s most
subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. Senior management has reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related
disclosure. SYSCO’s most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable, self-insurance programs, pension plans, income taxes, vendor consideration and
accounting for business combinations.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

SYSCO evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate
reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the company
is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance
for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to
be collected. In addition, allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of
historical trends of write-offs and recoveries. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine
uncollectible receivables to be written off, including bankruptcy, accounts referred to outside
parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods. If the financial condition of
SYSCO’s customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.

Self-Insurance Program

SYSCO maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation, group
medical, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured
levels are fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with these risks are
estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity
factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently
uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly
affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In
an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability claims,
safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented.

Pension Plans

Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined
on an actuarial basis. Three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the
discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of
increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets.

The measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end
for fiscal years 2005 and prior. Beginning in fiscal 2006, the measurement date will be May

st

which represents a change in accounting. The one-month acceleration of the
measurement date will allow additional time for management to evaluate and report the actuarial
pension measurements in the year-end financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated
filing deadlines of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cumulative effect of this change in
accounting is expected to result in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of
approximately $9,400,000, net of tax.

For guidance in determining the discount rate, SYSCO calculates the implied rate of return on
a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount
of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plans. The discount rate
assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate assumption
utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The discount rate utilized to determine
net pension costs for fiscal 2005 increased 0.25% to 6.25% from the discount rate utilized to
determine net pension costs for fiscal 2004 of 6.00%. This 0.25% increase in the discount rate
decreased SYSCO’s net pension costs for fiscal 2005 by approximately $9,500,000. The discount rate
for determining fiscal 2006 net pension costs, which was determined as of the May 31, 2005
measurement date, decreased 0.65% to 5.60%. This 0.65% decrease will increase SYSCO’s net pension
costs for fiscal 2006 by approximately $29,300,000.

SYSCO looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation
levels. SYSCO used a plan specific age-related set of rates (equivalent to a single rate of 5.89%)
for the qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan), as of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004. The
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan assumes annual salary increases of 10% through fiscal 2007
and 7% thereafter as of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004.



The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was 9.00% for
fiscal 2005 and 2004. The expectations
 of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as
to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance
analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long-term
bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not determinative of future
returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound
averaging, was approximately 10.9%, 10.3%, 3.3% and 12.3% over the 20-year, 10-year, 5-year and
1-year periods ended December 31, 2004, respectively. In addition, in nine of the last 15 years,
the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 9.00%. The rate of return assumption is reviewed
annually and revised as deemed appropriate.

The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. A 1.0%
increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2006 would decrease (increase) SYSCO’s
net pension costs for fiscal 2006 by approximately $11,600,000.

Minimum pension liability adjustments are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is
at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. Minimum pension liability
adjustments are non-cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase (or decrease) in the pension
liability and an offsetting charge (or benefit) to shareholders’ equity, net of tax, through
comprehensive loss (or income). Amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or
loss related to minimum pension liability, were charges, net of tax, of $54,286,000 as of July 2,
2005, and $20,733,000 as of July 3, 2004.

Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount rate discussed above, together
with the normal growth of the plan, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the
timing and amount of contributions, decreased net pension costs $7,374,000 in fiscal 2005 and is
expected to increase net pension costs in fiscal 2006 by approximately $23,700,000.

The company made cash contributions to its pension plans of $220,361,000 and $165,512,000 in
fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively, including voluntary contributions to the Retirement Plan
of $214,000,000 and $160,000,000 in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Included in the
amounts contributed in fiscal 2005 was $134,000,000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified
pension plan in the fourth quarter. The decision to increase the contributions to the Retirement
Plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decreased discount rate, which increased the pension
obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 year-end pension funded status. In fiscal 2006,
as in the previous years, contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be required to meet ERISA
minimum funding requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary contributions
of approximately $66,000,000, which is the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in
fiscal 2006. The estimated fiscal 2006 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and
other post-retirement plans together are approximately $7,997,000.

Income Taxes

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment,
the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The company’s
provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S.
federal and state, as well as Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law
changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or
adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in
the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

In evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions, the company
establishes an accrual when, despite management’s belief that the company’s tax return positions
are supportable, management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a
loss is probable. When facts and circumstances change, these accruals are adjusted.

Vendor Consideration

SYSCO recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection
with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by SYSCO. There
are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor
consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, SYSCO
will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold.
In the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product
purchases, SYSCO will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is
complete, the related service is performed and the amounts realized. In certain of these latter
instances, the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental
identifiable cost incurred by SYSCO. In these cases, SYSCO classifies the consideration as a
reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and
recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed.

Accounting for Business Combinations

Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value
of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the
fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as
determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. In addition, SYSCO
assesses the



recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable
reporting units exceed their carrying values. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of
projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing
a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that
would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry. Actual results could differ from these
assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required,
recognizing an impairment loss.

New Accounting Standards

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123). SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB Opinion 25), and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of
Cash Flows.” Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS
123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro
forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard.

SYSCO will adopt SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123(R) allows for two
transition methods. The basic difference between the two methods is that the modified-prospective
transition method does not require restatement of prior periods, whereas the
modified-retrospective transition method will require restatement.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no
compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase
plan. Although the full impact of the company’s adoption of SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method has
not yet been determined, the company expects that it will have a significant impact on its results
of operations. The disclosure in the footnotes to the company’s consolidated financial statements
under Stock-Based Compensation of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company
had recognized compensation cost for share-based payments under SFAS 123 for periods prior to
fiscal 2006 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost
for share-based payments under SFAS 123(R) in future periods. The company estimates that the
earnings per share impact to fiscal 2006 resulting from
recording compensation expense related to stock options
and the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan
will be approximately $0.11 to $0.13. The potential impact of adopting
SFAS 123(R) on fiscal 2006’s results of operations and earnings per share is dependent on several
factors, including the number of options granted in fiscal 2006, the fair value of those options
which will be determined at the date of grant, the level of participation in the Employees’ Stock
Purchase Plan, the related income tax benefits recorded and the diluted shares outstanding. This
estimate is based on certain assumptions as to these factors and the actual impact may differ if
actual results vary from the assumptions.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements.” The standard changes the requirements for accounting
for and reporting of a voluntary change in accounting principle requiring a retrospective
application to prior periods’ financial statements of the change in principle unless it is
impracticable rather than the recording of a cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle in net income in the year of change. The standard is effective for accounting changes
and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.

Risk Factors

Low Margin Business; Inflation and Economic Sensitivity

The foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover
with relatively low profit margins. SYSCO makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that
are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup. As a result, SYSCO’s profit
levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though SYSCO’s
gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation
also may have a negative impact on the company’s profit margins and earnings to the extent such
product cost increases are not passed on to customers due to resistance to higher prices. The
foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions. Inflation, fuel
costs and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount spent by
consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact SYSCO’s sales and operating
results. SYSCO’s operating results are also sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, other
factors, including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable, competitive price
pressures, severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other
transportation-related costs. Although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on
SYSCO’s past operations, there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not
adversely affect future operating results.



Increased Fuel Costs

Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations. The
high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus
reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. The high cost
of fuel can also increase the price paid by SYSCO for product as well as the costs incurred by
SYSCO to deliver product to its customers. These factors in turn may negatively impact SYSCO’s
sales, margins, operating expenses and operating results.

Interruption of Supplies and Increases in Product Costs

SYSCO obtains substantially all of its foodservice and related products from third party
suppliers. For the most part, SYSCO does not have long-term contracts with its suppliers committing
them to provide products to SYSCO. Although SYSCO’s purchasing volume can provide leverage when
dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by
SYSCO in the quantities and at the prices requested. Because SYSCO does not control the actual
production of the products it sells, it also is subject to delays caused by interruption in
production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside its control. These conditions
include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation
interruptions, increases in fuel costs, competitive demands and natural disasters or other
catastrophic events. SYSCO’s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice and related
products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could mean that SYSCO could not
fulfill its obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors.

Leverage and Debt Service

Because a substantial part of SYSCO’s growth historically has been the result of acquisitions
and capital expansion, SYSCO’s continued growth depends, in large part, on its ability to continue
this expansion. As a result, its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through
borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand. Moreover, any default under the documents
governing the indebtedness of SYSCO could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of
SYSCO’s common stock. Further, SYSCO’s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to
competitive pressures.

Product Liability Claims

SYSCO, like any other seller of food, faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims
in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness. With respect to
product liability claims, SYSCO believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability
insurance. However, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost, or, if
available, may not be adequate to cover all of SYSCO’s liabilities. SYSCO generally seeks
contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products, but this
indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of
the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If SYSCO does
not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to
defective products could materially reduce SYSCO’s net earnings and earnings per share.

Labor Relations

As of July 2, 2005, approximately 8,700 employees at 54 operating companies were members of 61
different local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor
organizations. In fiscal 2006, 16 agreements covering approximately 2,400 employees will expire.
Failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work
stoppages. Although SYSCO’s operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor
disputes or work stoppages to date, and SYSCO believes they have satisfactory relationships with
their unions, a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a
union contract, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on SYSCO.

Integration of Acquired Companies

If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated
economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, its profitability may decrease.
Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when SYSCO acquires a business in a
market in which it has limited or no expertise, or with a corporate culture different from SYSCO’s.
If SYSCO is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, it may incur substantial costs
and delays in increasing its customer base. In addition, the failure to integrate acquisitions
successfully may divert management’s attention from SYSCO’s existing business and may damage
SYSCO’s relationships with its key customers and suppliers.

Charter and Stockholder Rights Plan

Under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SYSCO’s Board of Directors is authorized to
issue up to 1.5 million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Issuance of these
shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire SYSCO



without approval of the Board of Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the
stock issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire SYSCO without approval of the Board of
Directors of SYSCO, the stockholders of SYSCO have the right to purchase preferred stock of SYSCO
pursuant to its Stockholder Rights Plan, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential
acquiror. The existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that
might result in an acquisition of SYSCO that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to
SYSCO’s stockholders.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations
or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward-looking statements under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about SYSCO’s ability to
increase its market share and sales, long-term debt to capitalization target ratios, anticipated
capital expenditures, timing and expected benefits of the National Supply Chain project and related
regional distribution centers, and SYSCO’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain
profitable.

These statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates; actual results
may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above. In addition, SYSCO’s ability
to increase its market share and sales, meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could
be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability
to control expenses. The ability to meet long-term debt to capitalization target ratios also may be
affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal
growth.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

SYSCO does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. SYSCO’s use of debt
directly exposes the company to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate
fluctuates periodically, exposes the company to short-term changes in market interest rates. Fixed
rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes the company to
changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the
company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate.

SYSCO manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating
rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from
interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such
instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest
rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions.

At July 2, 2005, the company had outstanding $157,851,000 of commercial paper at variable
rates of interest with maturities through July 29, 2005. The company’s total long-term debt
obligations of $1,367,110,000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest. The company intends to
issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long-term debt in September 2005. The amount
of long-term debt that SYSCO issues will depend
upon market conditions at the time of issuance. In March 2005, SYSCO entered into a
forward-starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $350,000,000 as a cash flow hedge of
the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on $350,000,000 of the forecasted debt
issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.

During fiscal 2004 and part of fiscal 2005, SYSCO had several fixed to floating interest
rate swaps outstanding. These were entered into in fiscal 2004 as management believed that
floating interest rates were more advantageous. During fiscal 2005, SYSCO terminated the fixed to
floating interest rate swaps outstanding locking in effective yields on the related debt.

Management believes that present market conditions reflect fixed long term rates near
historical lows. As such, management believes that fixed long term rates present a better
opportunity than in the recent past and intends to issue long term debt at fixed rates with
extended terms in September 2005.



In
the following tables, commercial paper issuances
are reflected as floating rate debt and the U.S. commercial paper is classified as long-term based
on the maturity of the company’s revolving loan agreement which supports the company’s U.S.
commercial paper program and the company’s intent to continue to refinance this facility on a
long-term basis.

The
following tables present the company’s interest rate position as of July 2, 2005. All
amounts are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents.

The company does not believe that its foreign operations expose it to significant foreign
exchange risk, since the exposure is limited primarily to Canada and for which the amounts are not
material on an overall basis to SYSCO.

Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations in
three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and
discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food
prepared away from home. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price paid by SYSCO for
product purchases for which SYSCO may not be able to pass these costs fully to its customers.
Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs incurred by SYSCO to deliver product to its customers.
During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, fuel costs represented approximately 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.3% of
sales, respectively. Fuel costs incurred by SYSCO in fiscal 2005 increased by approximately
$31,000,000 over fiscal 2004.

In order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs, SYSCO from time to
time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of SYSCO’s projected monthly diesel
fuel requirements. Forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of July 2, 2005 were
not material.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of SYSCO Corporation (“SYSCO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. SYSCO’s internal control
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

SYSCO’s management assessed the effectiveness of SYSCO’s internal control over financial
reporting as of July 2, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework.

Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of July 2, 2005, SYSCO’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on management’s assessment of SYSCO’s internal
control over financial reporting as of July 2, 2005.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

SYSCO Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Report of Management on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that SYSCO Corporation and its subsidiaries (“SYSCO” or
“the Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 2, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). SYSCO’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that SYSCO maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of July 2, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, SYSCO maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of July 2, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), SYSCO’s consolidated balance sheets as of July 2, 2005 and July 3,
2004 and the related consolidated results of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended July 2, 2005 and our report dated September 9, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

SYSCO Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SYSCO Corporation (a Delaware
Corporation) and subsidiaries as of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004, and the related consolidated
results of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended July 2, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule at Item 15(a),
No. 2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of SYSCO Corporation and subsidiaries at July 2, 2005
and July 3, 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended July 2, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of SYSCO Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting as of July 2, 2005, based on criteria established in the Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated September 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business and Consolidation

Sysco Corporation (SYSCO or the company) is engaged in the marketing and distribution of a
wide range of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or
“food-prepared-away-from-home” industry. These services are performed for approximately 390,000
customers from 160 principal distribution facilities located throughout the United States and
Canada.

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of SYSCO and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated. Certain amounts in
the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2005 presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, sales and expenses. Actual results could differ from the estimates used.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from customers and receivables from
suppliers for marketing or incentive programs. SYSCO evaluates the collectibility of accounts
receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of
factors. In circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its
financial obligation to SYSCO, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the
receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. In addition, allowances are
recorded for all other receivables based on an analysis of historical trends of write-offs and
recoveries. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be
written off including bankruptcy, accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts
past due over specified periods. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $29,604,000 as
of July 2, 2005 and $34,175,000 as of July 3, 2004. Customer accounts written off, net of
recoveries, were $20,840,000 or 0.07% of sales, $28,485,000 or 0.10% of sales, and $24,771,000 or
0.09% of sales for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories consisting primarily of finished goods include food and related products held for
resale and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Elements of
costs include the purchase price of the product and freight charges to deliver the product to the
company’s warehouses and are net of certain cash or non-cash consideration received from vendors
(see “Vendor Consideration”).

Plant and Equipment

Capital additions, improvements and major replacements are classified as plant and equipment
and are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which reduces the
book value of each asset in equal amounts over its estimated useful life. Maintenance, repairs and
minor replacements are charged to earnings when they are incurred. Upon the disposition of an
asset, its accumulated depreciation is deducted from the original cost, and any gain or loss is
reflected in current earnings.

Applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of new facilities and development
of software for internal use are capitalized as one of the elements of cost and are amortized over
the assets’ estimated useful lives. Interest capitalized for the past three years was $4,316,000 in
2005, $7,495,000 in 2004 and $5,244,000 in 2003.

A summary of plant and equipment, including the related accumulated depreciation, appears

and $263,480,000 in 2003.



Long-Lived Assets

Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be
generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset’s useful life based on updated
projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable, the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model.

Goodwill and Intangibles

Goodwill and intangibles represent the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible net assets
acquired. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles with
definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to ten years.
Intangibles, net of amortization, totaled $71,856,000 and $43,716,000 as of July 2, 2005 and July
3, 2004, respectively, and relate primarily to customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete
agreements with key personnel. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to
benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverability of goodwill and intangibles is
assessed annually, or more frequently as needed when events or changes have occurred that would
suggest an impairment of carrying value, by determining whether the fair values of the applicable
reporting units exceed their carrying values. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of
projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing
a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that
would be applied in comparable acquisitions.

Goodwill and intangibles allocated by reportable segment are as follows:

The above amounts are presented net of accumulated amortization of $153,544,000 and
$145,975,000 as of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004, respectively. Amortization expense for the past
three years was $7,569,000 in 2005, $4,244,000 in 2004 and $1,754,000 in 2003.

Foreign Currency Translation

The assets and liabilities of all Canadian subsidiaries are translated at current exchange
rates. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Revenue Recognition

The company recognizes revenue from the sale of a product when it is considered to be realized
or realizable and earned. The company determines these requirements to be met at the point at which
the product is delivered to the customer. The company grants certain customers sales incentives
such as rebates or discounts and treats these as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is
recognized.

Vendor Consideration

SYSCO recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection
with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by SYSCO. There
are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor
consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, SYSCO
will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold.
In the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product
purchases, SYSCO will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is
complete, the related service is performed and the amounts realized. In certain of these latter
instances, the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental
identifiable cost incurred by SYSCO. In these cases, SYSCO classifies the consideration as a
reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and
recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed.

Insurance Program

SYSCO maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation, group
medical, general and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are
fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in
part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other
actuarial assumptions.



Stock-Based Compensation

SYSCO accounts for its stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method provided by
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations under which no compensation cost has been recognized for stock option
grants. SYSCO will adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” in the first quarter
of fiscal 2006. See “New Accounting Standards” for further discussion of this new standard and the
impact to SYSCO.

Options issued before September 2001 generally vest over a five-year period beginning on the
date of grant if certain operating performance measures are attained, or will vest fully nine and
one-half years from the date of grant to the extent not previously vested. Options issued in
September 2001 and after generally vest ratably over a specified five-year period.

The following table provides comparative pro forma net earnings and earnings per share had
compensation cost for these plans been determined using the fair value method of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” for all periods presented:

The weighted average fair value of options granted was $7.12, $6.74 and $6.88 per share during
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value on the date of grant was estimated using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for each
fiscal year:

The weighted average fair value of employee stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the
Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan was $5.19, $5.17 and $4.14 per share during fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The fair value of the stock purchase rights was calculated as the difference
between the stock price at date of issuance and the employee purchase price.

The pro forma presentation includes only options granted after 1995. The pro forma effects for
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 are not necessarily indicative of the pro forma effects in future years.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs include costs associated with the selection of products and
delivery to customers. Included in operating expenses are shipping and handling costs of
approximately $1,718,485,000 in fiscal 2005, $1,624,552,000 in fiscal 2004, and $1,505,360,000 in
fiscal 2003.

Income Taxes

SYSCO follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by the
provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”



Cash Flow Information

For cash flow purposes, cash includes cash equivalents such as time deposits, certificates of
deposit, short-term investments and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three
months or less.

Acquisitions

During fiscal 2005, SYSCO acquired for cash one broadline foodservice operation, four custom
meat-cutting operations, and two specialty produce distributors. During fiscal 2004, SYSCO acquired
for cash certain assets of two broadline foodservice operations, a specialty produce distributor,
and one quickservice operation. During fiscal 2003, SYSCO acquired for cash a broadline foodservice
operation, two quickservice operations, a custom meat-cutting operation, a specialty distributor of
products to the Asian cuisine foodservice market and a distributor of paper and chemical products.

During fiscal 2005, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of $115,637,000 and issued 214,145
shares with a value of $4,196,000 for acquisitions during fiscal 2005 and for contingent
consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years. In addition, escrowed funds
related to certain acquisitions in the amount of $676,000 were released to sellers during fiscal
2005.

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the
financial statements include the results of the acquired operations from the respective dates they
joined SYSCO. The acquisitions were immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, to the
consolidated financial statements.

The purchase price of the acquired entities is allocated to the net assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition, with any excess
of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangibles, recognized as goodwill.
The balances included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to recent acquisitions are based
upon preliminary information and are subject to change when final asset and liability valuations
are obtained. Material changes to the preliminary allocations are not anticipated by management.

Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that
certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate
contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of July 2, 2005 included approximately 1,059,000
shares and $105,614,000 in cash, which, if distributed, could result in the recording of up to
$126,992,000 in additional goodwill. Such amounts typically are to be paid out over periods of up
to five years from the date of acquisition.

Derivative Financial Instruments

SYSCO manages its debt portfolio by targeting an overall desired position of fixed and
floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps from time to time to achieve this goal. The
company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

During fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005, the company entered into various interest rate swap
agreements as fair value hedges of the related debt. The terms of these swap agreements and the
hedged items were such that the hedges are considered perfectly effective against changes in the
fair value of the debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rates over their terms. As a
result, the shortcut method provided by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” was applied and there was no need to periodically reassess the effectiveness
of the hedges during the terms of the swaps. Interest expense on the debt was adjusted to include
payments made or received under the hedge agreements. The fair value of the swaps was carried as an
asset or a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the carrying value of the hedged debt
was adjusted accordingly. As of July 3, 2004, the fair value of the outstanding swaps designated as
fair value hedges was ($5,430,000), which is reflected in Other long-term liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the carrying amount of the related debt has been decreased by the
same amount. There were no fair value hedges outstanding as of July 2, 2005.

The amount received upon termination of swap agreements was $5,316,000, $1,305,000 and
$15,359,000 in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount received upon
termination of swap agreements is reflected as an increase in the carrying value of the related
debt to reflect its fair value at termination. This increase in the carrying value of the debt is
amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt.

The
company intends to issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long-term debt in September 2005. The amount
of long-term debt that SYSCO issues will depend on market conditions at the time of issuance. In March 2005, SYSCO
entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $350,000,000. In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, the company has designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of
the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on $350,000,000 of the forecasted debt
issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The fair value of the swap as of July 2,
2005 was ($32,584,000), which is reflected in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income.



New Accounting Standards

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
(SFAS 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(SFAS 123). SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(APB Opinion 25), and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Generally, the approach in
SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative
under the new standard.

SYSCO will adopt SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123(R) allows for two
transition methods. The basic difference between the two methods is that the modified-prospective
transition method does not require restatement of prior periods, whereas the
modified-retrospective transition method will require restatement.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no
compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase
plan. Although the full impact of the company’s adoption of SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method has
not yet been determined, the company expects that it will have a significant impact on its results
of operations. The disclosure in the footnotes to the company’s consolidated financial statements
under Stock-Based Compensation of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company
had recognized compensation cost for share-based payments under SFAS 123 for periods prior to
fiscal 2006 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost
for share-based payments under SFAS 123(R) in future periods. The company estimates that earnings per share
impact to fiscal 2006 resulting from recording compensation expense related to stock options and the
Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan will be approximately $0.11 to $0.13. The potential impact of adopting
SFAS 123(R) on fiscal 2006’s results of operations and earnings per share is dependent on several
factors including the number of options granted in fiscal 2006, the fair value of those options
which will be determined at the date of grant, the level of participation in the Employees’ Stock
Purchase Plan, the related income tax benefits recorded and the diluted shares outstanding. This
estimate is based on certain assumptions as to these factors and the actual impact may differ if
actual results vary from the assumptions.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements.” The standard changes the requirements for accounting
for and reporting of a voluntary change in accounting principle requiring a retrospective
application to prior periods’ financial statements of the change in principle unless it is
impracticable rather than the recording of a cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle in net income in the year of change. The standard is effective for accounting changes
and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.

Included in the income taxes charged to earnings are net deferred tax provisions of
$554,850,000, $608,152,000, and $481,330,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net changes during the year in deferred tax
assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In
addition to the deferred tax provision, changes in the deferred tax liability balances in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 were also impacted by the reclassification of deferred supply chain
distributions from current deferred tax liabilities to accrued income taxes based on the timing of
when payments related to these items become payable. These reclassifications were $473,970,000 and
$412,339,000 in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Deferred supply chain distributions are classified as current or deferred tax liabilities
based on when the related income tax payments will become payable. Fiscal 2004 was the first fiscal
year that these supply chain distributions were recognized in taxable income since the company
began deferring these items for tax purposes as a result of the reorganization of its supply chain
in fiscal year 2001. As a result of the impact of these items and other temporary differences,
including the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, excess tax depreciation and pension
contributions, taxes paid during fiscal 2005 and 2004 increased to $436,378,000 and $344,414,000,
respectively, as compared to $28,747,000 in fiscal 2003. The net cash flow impact of supply chain
distribution deferrals in fiscal 2005 was incrementally positive when compared to what would have
been paid on an annual basis without the deferral, due to increased volume through this structure.

The amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2004 was reduced by $70,615,000 as the result of the
utilization of a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward. This net operating loss
carryforward was generated in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the deferral of supply chain
distributions.

Also impacting the amount of taxes paid in each year is the amount of deductible pension
contributions made in each year. The company expects that its pension contributions in fiscal 2006
will be substantially less than the contributions made in the preceeding three fiscal years.

The company had state and Canadian net operating losses at July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004,
respectively. The net operating losses outstanding at July 2, 2005 expire in fiscal years 2006
through 2025. A valuation allowance of $77,334,000 and $68,501,000 was recorded as of July 2, 2005
and July 3, 2004, respectively, as management believes that it is more likely than not that the
benefits of these state and Canadian tax loss carryforwards will not be realized through future
taxable income.

Reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates for
each fiscal year are as follows:

In evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions, the company
establishes an accrual when, despite management’s belief that the company’s tax return positions
are supportable, management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a
loss is probable. When facts and circumstances change, these accruals are adjusted. Included in
income tax expense for fiscal 2005 is the reversal of an accrual for tax contingencies of
$11,000,000. Based on additional information and supported by a third party analysis, the company
concluded that the accrual was no longer necessary. Liabilities recorded related to tax
contingencies as of July 2, 2005 are not material.

Also included in income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 are income tax
adjustments totaling $8,500,000. These adjustments primarily related to the reversal of valuation
allowances of certain state tax loss carryforwards. In the fourth quarter of



fiscal 2005, management determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits of
certain state tax loss carryforwards will be realized and reversed the related valuation allowances
recording a benefit to income tax expense totaling $6,275,000.

The company intends to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of its Canadian
subsidiaries in those businesses outside of the United States and, therefore, has not provided for
deferred income taxes on such undistributed foreign earnings. The determination of the amount of
the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable.

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment,
the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The company’s
provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S.
federal and state, as well as Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law
changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or
adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in
the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

Restricted Cash

SYSCO is required by its insurers to collateralize a part of the self-insured portion of its
workers’ compensation and liability claims. SYSCO has chosen to satisfy these collateral
requirements by depositing funds in insurance trusts or by issuing letters of credit.

In addition, for certain acquisitions, SYSCO has placed funds into escrow to be disbursed to
the sellers in the event that specified operating results are attained or contingencies are
resolved. Escrowed funds related to certain acquisitions in the amount of $676,000 were released
to sellers during fiscal 2005.

Shareholders’ Equity

On November 7, 2003, SYSCO’s shareholders approved an amendment to SYSCO’s restated
Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock that SYSCO will have
the authority to issue to two billion shares, an increase from the previous authorization of one
billion shares.

Basic earnings per share have been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding for each respective year. Diluted earnings per share
have been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during those respective years adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options
outstanding using the treasury stock method.

A reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per share
computations for the periods presented follows:

The number of options which were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation

fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.



Dividends declared were $368,792,000, $321,353,000 and $273,852,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Included in dividends declared for each year were dividends declared but not
yet paid at year end of approximately $95,000,000, $83,000,000 and $71,000,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

In May 1986, the Board of Directors adopted a Warrant Dividend Plan designed to protect
against those unsolicited attempts to acquire control of SYSCO that the Board believes are not in
the best interests of the shareholders. In May 1996, the Board of Directors adopted an Amended and
Restated Rights Agreement (the Plan) to replace the Warrant Dividend Plan and, among other things,
extend the expiration of the Plan through May 2006. The Board adopted further amendments in May
1999. The Plan provides for an initial dividend distribution (which took place in 1996) and
subsequent issuances of Preferred Stock Purchase Rights (Rights) concurrently with future common
share issuances such that, prior to any adjustments, each outstanding share of SYSCO common stock
would be associated with one Right. After adjustments for common stock splits, there is now one
quarter of a Right associated with each common share.

The Rights will not be exercisable until a public announcement is made that a party has
acquired 10% or more of SYSCO’s common stock or a party makes a tender offer for 10% or more of its
common stock, without Board approval (each a Trigger Event). Currently, following occurrence of a
Trigger Event, each whole Right would, upon exercise, entitle its holder to purchase one
two-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (Preferred) at an
exercise price of $175. The terms are subject to adjustment upon certain future events. In addition
to the foregoing, subject to limited exceptions, if a public announcement is made that a party has
acquired 10% or more of SYSCO’s common stock, a Rightholder may, for a limited time, purchase $350
worth of Preferred for a purchase price of $175. In the event of a merger or other business
combination transaction not approved by the Board, each Right effectively entitles the holder to
purchase $350 worth of stock of the surviving company for a purchase price of $175.

The Rights may be redeemed by SYSCO at a price of $0.01 per Right at any time before a party
acquires 10% of SYSCO’s common stock. Unless sooner redeemed or exercised, the Rights will expire
at close of business May 31, 2006. As a result of the Rights distribution, 450,000 of the 1,500,000
authorized preferred shares have been reserved for issuance as Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock.

SYSCO has uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for
working capital of up to $95,000,000. Borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit were
$31,000,000 and zero, as of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004, respectively.

SYSCO has a revolving loan agreement in the amount of $450,000,000, maturing in fiscal 2008,
which supports the company’s United States commercial paper program. It is the company’s intent to
continue to refinance this facility on a long-term basis and expects to do so in the fall of 2005.
As a result, the commercial paper issuances supported by this agreement have been classified as
long-term debt. The United States commercial paper issuances outstanding at July 2, 2005 and July
3, 2004 were $124,853,000 and zero, respectively.

SYSCO also has a revolving loan agreement in the amount of $100,000,000 in Canadian dollars
(CAD), maturing in fiscal 2006, which supports the company’s Canadian commercial paper program. The
Canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding at July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004 were CAD
$40,996,000 ($32,998,000 in U.S. dollars) and CAD $97,768,000 ($73,834,000 in U.S. dollars),
respectively.



In April 2005, SYSCO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration
statement covering $1,500,000,000 in debt securities. The registration statement was declared
effective in May 2005. In June 2005, SYSCO repaid the 6.5% senior notes totaling $150,000,000 at
maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In
July 2005, SYSCO repaid the 4.75% senior notes totaling $200,000,000 at maturity also utilizing a
combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. The company intends to
issue between $350,000,000 and $500,000,000 of long-term debt in September 2005. The amount of
long-term debt that SYSCO issues will depend
upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The proceeds from such issuance are intended to be
utilized to repay outstanding commercial paper issuances and for working capital and general
corporate purposes.

The 6.5% debentures due August 1, 2028 and the 4.60% Notes due March 15, 2014 are unsecured,
are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows
SYSCO to retire the debentures at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued
interest or an amount designed to ensure that the debenture holders are not penalized by the early
redemption.

The 7.0% senior notes due May 1, 2006 and the 7.25% senior notes due April 15, 2007 are
unsecured, are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund
requirement.

The 7.16% debentures due April 15, 2027 are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund
requirement and are redeemable at the option of the holder on April 15, 2007, but otherwise are not
redeemable prior to maturity.

The 6.10% senior notes due June 1, 2012 , issued by SYSCO International, Co., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of SYSCO, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco Corporation, are not subject
to any sinking fund requirement, and include a redemption provision which allow SYSCO
International, Co. to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus
accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders were not penalized by the
early redemption.

SYSCO’s Industrial Revenue Bonds have varying structures. Final maturities range from six to
21 years and certain of the bonds provide SYSCO the right to redeem (or call) the bonds at various
dates. These call provisions generally provide the bondholder a premium in the early call years,
declining to par value as the bonds approach maturity.

Total debt at July 2, 2005 was $1,431,108,000, of which approximately 86% was at fixed rates
averaging 5.6% with an average life of 9 years, and the remainder was at floating rates averaging
3.2%. Certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders, including
provisions to maintain the company’s long-term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level.
SYSCO was in compliance with all debt covenants at July 2, 2005.

The fair value of SYSCO’s total long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices
for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the company for debt of the same
remaining maturities. The fair value of total long-term debt approximated $1,442,721,000 at July 2,
2005 and $1,459,969,000 at July 3, 2004, respectively.

As of July 2, 2005 and July 3, 2004, letters of credit outstanding were $76,817,000 and
$11,001,000, respectively.

Leases

Although SYSCO normally purchases assets, it has obligations under capital and operating
leases for certain distribution facilities, vehicles and computers. Total rental expense under
operating leases was $92,710,000, $86,842,000, and $83,597,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Contingent rentals, subleases and assets and obligations under capital leases are not
significant.

Aggregate minimum lease payments by fiscal year under existing non-capitalized long-term
leases are as follows:

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

1991 Stock Option Plan

The 1991 Stock Option Plan (1991 Plan) was adopted in fiscal 1992 and originally reserved
12,000,000 shares of SYSCO common stock for options to directors, officers and key personnel of the
company and its subsidiaries at the market price at the date of grant. The 1991 Plan provided for
the issuance of options qualified as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, options which are not so qualified and stock appreciation rights. Vesting requirements for
awards under this plan vary by individual grant and include a combination of both time-based and
performance-based vesting. The contractual life of all options granted under this plan is 10 years.
During fiscal 1996, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1991 Plan for an additional
32,000,000 shares to be made available for future grants of options. No stock appreciation rights
were issued under this plan. No further grants will be made under this plan, which expired in
November 2000 and was replaced by the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.

2000 Stock Incentive Plan

The 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (2000 Plan) was adopted in fiscal 2001 and provided for option
grants and other stock-based awards to directors, officers and other employees of the company and
its subsidiaries at the market price at the date of grant. The 2000 Plan originally reserved
40,000,000 shares of SYSCO common stock, plus any shares of common stock which were available for
grants under the 1991 Plan but which were not utilized prior to its expiration and any shares
issued under the 1991 Plan that are forfeited, expire or are cancelled and up to 10,000,000 shares
of common stock which were reacquired by the company in the open market or in private transactions
after November 3, 2000. The 2000 Plan provided for the issuance of options qualified as incentive
stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, options which are not so qualified, stock
appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. Vesting requirements for awards under this plan
vary by individual grant and include a combination of both time-based and performance-based
vesting. The contractual life of all options granted under this plan through July 3, 2004 is 10
years; options granted after July 3, 2004 have a contractual life of seven years. No stock
appreciation rights or other stock-based awards were issued under this plan. No further grants will
be made under this plan, which expired in November 2004 and was replaced by the 2004 Stock Option
Plan.

1993 and 1996 Guest Supply Stock Incentive Plans

Prior to March 2001, Guest Supply, Inc. maintained the 1993 Stock Option Plan and the 1996
Long-Term Incentive Plan (Guest Supply Plans). In connection with SYSCO’s acquisition of Guest
Supply in March 2001, all outstanding options exercisable to purchase Guest Supply common stock
were converted into options to purchase shares of SYSCO common stock. The number of shares
underlying such options, as well as the exercise price, were adjusted pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated January 22, 2001. These options are fully vested
and expire 10 years from the original grant date. No new options will be issued under any of the
Guest Supply Plans.

Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan and Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan

The Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan adopted in fiscal 1996 permitted the issuance of
up to 800,000 shares of common stock to non-employee directors. No further grants will be made
under this plan, which was replaced by the Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan in November 1998. The
plan was amended and restated in November 2001.

The Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan permits the issuance of up to 800,000 shares of common
stock to non-employee directors. Under this plan, non-employee directors may receive an annual
grant of options to purchase shares of common stock if certain earnings goals are met. Vesting
requirements for awards under these plans vary by individual grant and include a combination of
both time-based and performance-based vesting. The contractual life of all options granted under
this plan through July 3, 2004 is 10 years; options granted after July 3, 2004 have a contractual
life of seven years.

As of July 2, 2005, options for a total of 824,000 shares have been granted under these plans,
of which 194,664 have been exercised, 32,000 have been cancelled and 432,536 are available for
exercise. As of July 2, 2005, there were 135,898 remaining shares authorized and available for
grant under the Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan.

In addition to the options summarized in the tables above, one-time retainer awards of

fair value at date of grant of $35.25 per share in fiscal 2005, 4,000 shares with a fair value at
date of grant of $34.12 per share in fiscal 2004 and 4,000 shares with a fair value at date of
grant of $31.47 per share in fiscal 2003.



Non-employee directors may also elect to receive up to 50% of their annual directors’ fees in
SYSCO common stock. As a result of such elections, a total of 11,836, 11,640 and 12,496 shares with
a weighted-average grant date fair value of $35.38, $30.82 and $28.73 per share were issued in
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In total, 144,102 shares of restricted stock have been issued to non-employee directors under
the Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan.

Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan

SYSCO has an Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan which permits employees (other than directors) to
invest by means of periodic payroll deductions in SYSCO common stock at 85% of the closing price on
the last business day of each calendar quarter. During fiscal 2005, 1,712,244 shares of SYSCO
common stock were purchased by the participants as compared to 1,620,535 shares purchased in fiscal
2004 and 1,886,090 shares purchased in fiscal 2003. The total number of shares which may be sold
pursuant to the plan may not exceed 68,000,000 shares, of which 6,735,112 remained available at
July 2, 2005. In July 2005, 410,375 shares were purchased by participants.

Management Incentive Compensation

SYSCO has a Management Incentive Plan that compensates key management personnel for specific
performance achievements. The bonuses earned and expensed under this plan were $50,505,000 in
fiscal 2005, $77,494,000 in fiscal 2004 and $62,486,000 in fiscal 2003; these amounts were paid in
the following fiscal year in both cash and stock or deferred for payment in future years at the
election of each participant. There were 174, 174 and 165 participants in the plan in fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. A total of 1,001,624 shares, 940,843 shares and 861,156 shares at a
fair value of $34.80, $29.55 and $27.22 were issued pursuant to this plan in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, for bonuses earned in the preceding fiscal years. As of July 2, 2005, there
were 4,345,650 remaining shares that may be issued under the Management Incentive Plan. In August
2005, 617,637 shares were issued in payment for the portion of the bonuses earned in fiscal 2005
elected to be received in stock. Participants in the Management Incentive Plan also have the option
to defer portions of their salary and bonuses pursuant to the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Employee Benefit Plans

SYSCO has defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees. Also,
the company contributes to various multi-employer plans under collective bargaining agreements and
provides certain health care benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents.

SYSCO maintains a qualified retirement plan (Retirement Plan) that pays benefits to employees
at retirement, using formulas based on a participant’s years of service and compensation.

The defined contribution 401(k) plan provides that under certain circumstances the company may
make matching contributions of up to 50% of the first 6% of a participant’s compensation. SYSCO’s
contributions to this plan were $28,109,000 in 2005, $27,390,000 in 2004, and $24,102,000 in 2003.

In addition to receiving benefits upon retirement under the company’s defined benefit plan,
participants in the Management Incentive Plan (see

“Management Incentive Compensation”

under “Stock
Based Compensation Plans”) will receive benefits under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(SERP). This plan is a nonqualified, unfunded supplementary retirement plan. In order to meet its
obligations under the SERP, SYSCO maintains life insurance policies on the lives of the
participants with carrying values of $138,931,000 at July 2, 2005 and $87,104,000 at July 3, 2004.
These policies are not included as plan assets or in the funded status amounts in the table below.
SYSCO is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies. Projected benefit obligations and
accumulated benefit obligations for the SERP were $375,491,000 and $264,010,000, respectively, as
of July 2, 2005 and $269,815,000 and $153,652,000, respectively, as of July 3, 2004.

The company made cash contributions to its pension plans of $220,361,000 and $165,512,000 in
fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively, including $214,000,000 and $160,000,000 in voluntary
contributions to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in the amounts
contributed in fiscal 2005 was $134,000,000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan
in the fourth quarter. The decision to increase the contributions to the qualified pension plan in
fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decreased discount rate, which increased the pension
obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 year-end pension funded status. In fiscal 2006,
as in previous years, contributions to the Retirement Plan will not be required to meet ERISA
minimum funding requirements, yet the company anticipates it will make voluntary contributions of
approximately $66,000,000. The company’s contributions to the SERP and other post-retirement plans
are made in the amounts needed to fund current year benefit payments. The estimated fiscal 2006
contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other post-retirement plans are $7,659,000
and $338,000, respectively.

(266,075,000

Minimum pension liability adjustments result when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds
the fair value of plan assets and are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at a
minimum equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. Minimum pension liability adjustments
are non-cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase (or decrease) in the pension liability
and an offsetting charge (or benefit) to shareholders’ equity, net of tax, through comprehensive
loss (or income) rather than net income.

Amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to minimum pension
liability, were charges, net of tax, of $54,286,000 as of July 2, 2005, and $20,733,000 as of July
3, 2004.

As a result of changes in assumptions, including the increase in the discount rate to 6.25%
for fiscal 2005 from 6.00% in fiscal 2004, together with the normal growth of the plan, the impact
of losses from prior periods and the amount and timing of contributions, net pension costs
decreased $7,374,000 in fiscal 2005. Net pension costs in fiscal 2006 are expected to increase by
approximately $23,700,000 due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate to 5.60%, which is based
on the new measurement date of May 31

st

discussed below, for fiscal 2006. The components

For determining net pension costs for each fiscal year, the SERP calculations assume annual

increases of 8% through fiscal 2005 and 7% thereafter for fiscal 2004 and 2003.



The measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end
for fiscal years 2005 and prior. Beginning in fiscal 2006, the measurement date will be May

st

which represents a change in accounting. The one-month acceleration of the
measurement date will allow additional time for management to evaluate and report the actuarial
pension measurements in the year-end financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated
filing deadlines of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cumulative effect of this change
in accounting is expected to result in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2006
of approximately $9,400,000, net of tax.

A healthcare cost trend rate is not used in the calculations because SYSCO subsidizes the cost
of postretirement medical coverage by a fixed dollar amount with the retiree responsible for the
cost of coverage in excess of the subsidy, including all future cost increases.

For guidance in determining the discount rate, SYSCO calculates the implied rate of return on
a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount
of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plans. The discount rate
assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived from a mathematical asset
model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination
of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets
regarding the yield on long-term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. The
rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.

SYSCO’s investment objectives target a mix of investments that can potentially achieve an
above-average rate of return. SYSCO has determined that this strategy is appropriate due to the
relatively low ratio of retirees as a percentage of participants, low average years of participant
service and low average age of participants and is willing to accept the above-average level of
short-term risk and variability in returns to attempt to achieve a higher level of long-term
returns. As a result, the company’s strategy targets a mix of investments which include 70% stocks
(including a mix of large capitalization U.S. stocks, small- to mid-capitalization U.S. stocks and
international stocks) and 30% fixed income investments and cash equivalents.

Commitments and Contingencies

SYSCO has committed with a third party service provider to provide hardware and hardware
hosting services. The services are to be provided over a ten year period beginning in fiscal 2005
and ending in fiscal 2015. The total cost of the services over that period are expected to be
approximately $300,000,000. This amount may be reduced by SYSCO utilizing less than estimated
resources and can be increased by SYSCO utilizing more than estimated resources and the adjustments
for inflation provided for in the agreements. SYSCO may also cancel a portion or all of the
services provided beginning in fiscal 2007 subject to termination fees which decrease over time.
Although it does not expect to, if SYSCO were to terminate all of the services in fiscal 2007, the
total estimated costs incurred during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 would be approximately
$32,000,000. SYSCO believes that these agreements will provide a more secure environment for its
data processing as well as reduce overall operating costs over the ten year period.

SYSCO is engaged in various legal proceedings which have arisen but have not been fully
adjudicated. These proceedings, in the opinion of management, will not have a material adverse
effect upon the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company when
ultimately concluded.



Supplemental Guarantor Information

SYSCO International, Co. is an unlimited liability company organized under the laws of the
Province of Nova Scotia, Canada and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SYSCO. In May 2002, SYSCO
International, Co. issued, in a private offering, $200,000,000 of 6.10% notes due in 2012 (see
“Debt”). In December 2002, these notes were exchanged for substantially identical notes in an
exchange offer registered under the Securities Act of 1933. These notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by SYSCO. SYSCO International, Co. is a holding company with no
significant sources of income or assets, other than its equity interests in its subsidiaries and
interest income from loans made to its subsidiaries. The proceeds from the issuance of the 6.10%
notes were used to repay commercial paper issued to fund the fiscal 2002 acquisition of a Canadian
broadline foodservice operation.

The following condensed consolidating financial statements present separately the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the parent guarantor (SYSCO), the subsidiary
issuer (SYSCO International), all other non-guarantor subsidiaries of SYSCO (Other Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries) on a combined basis and eliminating entries. The financial information for SYSCO
includes corporate activities as well as certain operating companies which were operated as
divisions of SYSCO prior to fiscal 2003. Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2003, these
divisions have been operated as subsidiaries and their results from that point in time are included
in the Other Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries column. The accompanying financial information includes the
balances and results of SYSCO International, Co. from the date of its inception in February 2002.

Business Segment Information

The company has aggregated its operating companies into a number of segments, of which only
Broadline and SYGMA are reportable segments as defined in SFAS No. 131. Broadline operating
companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both
traditional and chain restaurant customers. SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of
food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer
locations. “Other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other segments, including
the company’s specialty produce, custom-cut meat, Asian cuisine foodservice and lodging industry
products segments.

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by SYSCO.
Intersegment sales represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the
Broadline and SYGMA operating companies. The segment results include allocation of centrally
incurred costs for shared services that eliminate upon consolidation. Centrally incurred costs are
allocated based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company.
