PART I

Item 1.

Business

Unless this Form 10-K indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Sysco,” or “the company” as used in this Form 10-K refer to Sysco Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries and divisions.

Overview

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions, is the largest North American distributor of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. Historically, prior to the Brakes Acquisition, we provided products and related services to approximately

425,000

customers, including restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers.

Founded in 1969, Sysco commenced operations as a public company in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for Sysco common stock. Since our formation, we have grown from

$115 million

to

$50.4 billion

in annual sales, both through internal expansion of existing operations and through acquisitions.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30

th

.  This resulted in a 53-week year ending

July 2, 2016

for fiscal


, and a 52 week year ending

June 27, 2015

and

June 28, 2014

for fiscal


and fiscal


, respectively. We will have a 52-week year ending

July 1, 2017

for fiscal


.

Sysco Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. The address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077-2099, (281) 584-1390. This annual report on Form 10-K, as well as all other reports filed or furnished by Sysco pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge on Sysco’s website at

www.sysco.com

as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Acquisition of Brakes Group

In February 2016, Sysco entered into a share sale and purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) to acquire Cucina Lux Investments Limited, the parent holding company of the Brakes Group (the Brakes Acquisition). On July 5, 2016, following the end of fiscal year 2016, Sysco closed the Brakes Acquisition. The consideration paid by Sysco in connection with the Brakes Acquisition was approximately

£2.3 billion

(approximately

$3.1 billion

based on exchange rates on July 5, 2016), and included the repayment of approximately

$2.3 billion

of the Brakes Group's then outstanding debt.  The purchase price was paid primarily in cash using the proceeds from recent debt issuances and other cash on hand, and is subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The Brakes Group is now wholly owned by Sysco.

The Brakes Group is a leading European foodservice business by revenue, supplying fresh, refrigerated and frozen food products, as well as non-food products and supplies, to more than 50,000 foodservice customers ranging from large customers, including leisure, pub, restaurant, hotel and contract catering groups, to smaller customers, including independent restaurants, hotels, fast food outlets, schools and hospitals.  The Brakes Group has leading market positions in the U.K., France, and Sweden, in addition to a presence in Ireland, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg. The Brakes Acquisition significantly strengthens Sysco's position as the world's leading foodservice distributor and offers attractive opportunities for organic growth and future expansion in European markets.

The Brakes Group supplies more than 50,000 products, including a portfolio of more than 4,000 own-brand products. Brakes' products are generally delivered through its distribution networks, consisting of central distribution hubs, satellite depots and a fleet of over 2,000 delivery vehicles.  The Brakes Group also has separate divisions specializing in catering supplies and equipment.  Brakes Group companies include: Brakes, Brakes Catering Equipment, Brake France, Country Choice, Davigel, Fresh Direct, Freshfayre, M&J Seafood, Menigo Foodservice, Pauley's, Wild Harvest and Woodward Foodservice.

In light of the recent closing of the Brakes Acquisition, we are in the early stages of the onboarding process with respect to the Brakes Group. Accordingly, for purposes of Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the remaining discussion of our business refers to the legacy Sysco business, excluding the impact of the Brakes Acquisition, except as otherwise noted.

Operating Segments

Sysco provides food and related products to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable segments as defined by accounting standards. Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to their customers. SYGMA operating


companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to chain restaurant customer locations. Our other segments include our specialty produce companies, custom-cut meat companies, lodging industry products companies, a company that distributes specialty imported products, a company that distributes to international customers and the company’s Sysco Ventures platform, a suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of Sysco’s customers.  Specialty produce companies distribute fresh produce and, on a limited basis, other foodservice products.  Our specialty meat companies distribute custom-cut fresh steaks, other meat, seafood and poultry. Our lodging industry products companies distribute personal care guest amenities, equipment, housekeeping supplies, room accessories and textiles to the lodging industry.  Selected financial data for each of our reportable segments, as well as financial information concerning geographic areas, can be found in Note 21, “Business Segment Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

In fiscal


, our segment reporting will change due to the inclusion of the Brakes Group; however, at this time, we have not determined how the segments will change.

Customers and Products

Sysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, schools and colleges, hotels and motels, industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served. Services to our customers are supported by similar physical facilities, vehicles, material handling equipment and techniques, and administrative and operating staffs.

The products we distribute include:

•

a full line of frozen foods, such as meats, seafood, fully prepared entrees, fruits, vegetables and desserts;

•

a full line of canned and dry foods;

•

fresh meats and seafood;

•

dairy products;

•

beverage products;

•

imported specialties; and

•

fresh produce.

We also supply a wide variety of non-food items, including:

•

paper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups;

•

tableware such as china and silverware;

•

cookware such as pots, pans and utensils;

•

restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and

•

cleaning supplies.

A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below:

Our distribution centers, which we refer to as operating companies, distribute nationally-branded merchandise, as well as products packaged under our private brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for Sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our quality assurance team certifies


the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements.

We believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, competitive pricing, close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers. Our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice. Through our approximately

12,800

sales and marketing representatives and support staff of Sysco and our operating companies, we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services. Our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution, such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data, menu-planning advice, food safety training and assistance in inventory control, as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of Sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended

July 2, 2016

.

We estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows:

(1)

Other includes cafeterias that are not stand alone restaurants, bakeries, caterers, churches, civic and fraternal organizations, vending distributors, other distributors and international exports.  None of these types of customers, as a group, exceeded 5% of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented.

Sources of Supply

We purchase from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and international, none of which individually accounts for more than 10% of our purchases. These suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise, as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers. Purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs, both domestically and internationally, and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies.

We administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food and non-food products. The program covers the purchasing and marketing of Sysco Brand merchandise, as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers, encompassing substantially all product lines. Some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers in order to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network. Sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers, although Sysco Brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs. We also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels, which reduces future facility expansion needs at our Broadline operating companies, while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers. This includes the operation of regional distribution centers (RDCs), which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all Sysco Broadline operating companies in the region. Currently, we have two RDCs in operation, one in Virginia and one in Florida.

Working Capital Practices

Our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings.  See the discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 regarding our liquidity, financial position and sources and uses of funds.

Credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness. We monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary.

A majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed. We generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand. The level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelf-life, supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand. We also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities.


We take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to


days or more.

Corporate Headquarters and Shared Services Center

Our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies and our shared services center performs support services for employees, suppliers and customers. Members of these groups possess experience and expertise in, among other areas, customer and vendor contract administration, vendor payments, procurement and maintenance support, invoicing, cash application, accounting and finance, treasury, credit services, legal, cash management, information technology, employee benefits, engineering, real estate and construction, risk management and insurance, sales and marketing, payroll, human resources, training and development, strategy, and tax compliance services, including sales and use tax administration. The corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services, which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization, energy conservation, fleet management and work flow.

Capital Improvements

During fiscal


,


and


, approximately

$527.3 million

,

$542.8 million

and

$523.2 million

, respectively, were invested in delivery fleet, facilities, technology and other capital asset enhancements. From time to time, we dispose of assets in the normal course of business; we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures. During fiscal


,


and


, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, were

$503.8 million

,

$518.4 million

and

$497.4 million

, respectively. We estimate our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, in fiscal


should be approximately

1%

of sales. This estimate includes the impact of the Brakes Acquisition. During the three years ended

July 2, 2016

, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds, our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings. We expect to finance our fiscal


capital expenditures from the same sources.

Employees

As of

July 2, 2016

, we had approximately

51,900

employees, approximately

18%

of whom were represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company. Approximately

20%

of our union employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements have or will have expired contracts during fiscal


and are subject to renegotiation. Since

July 2, 2016

, there have been no contract renegotiations.  We consider our labor relations to be satisfactory.  The Brakes Group employs approximately

14,500

employees, approximately

41%

of whom were represented by unions, primarily in France and Sweden.

Competition

We believe there are a large number of companies engaged in the distribution of food and non-food products to the foodservice industry in the U.S. Our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets, including club, cash and carry and grocery stores, or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers. Online retailers and e-commerce companies are also participants in the foodservice industry. While we compete primarily in the U.S. with local and regional distributors, some organizations compete with us on a multi-region basis. In addition, these local, regional and multi-regional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix, improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices. Our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently. Product needs, service requirements and price are just a few of the factors they evaluate when deciding where to purchase. Customers can choose from many Broadline foodservice distributors, specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce, meat or seafood, other wholesale channels, club stores, cash and carry stores, grocery stores and numerous online retailers. Since switching costs are very low, customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly. There are few barriers to market entry. Existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers.

We consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the U.S., Canada and Ireland and estimate that we serve about

16.4%

of this approximately

$295 billion

annual market based on a measurement as of the end of calendar


. We believe, based upon industry trade data, that our sales to the U.S. and Canada food-away-from-home industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal


. While adequate industry statistics are not available, we believe that, in most instances, our operations in the U.S. and Canada are among the leading distributors of food and related non-food products to foodservice customers in those trading areas.  We believe our competitive advantages include our more than

7,600

marketing associates, our diversified product base, which includes a differentiated group of high quality Sysco brand products, the diversity in the types of customers we serve, our economies of scale and our multi-region portfolio in the U.S. and Canada, which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time. We believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements.  There is small number of companies competing in the food-away-from-h


ome industry in the U.S. with publicly traded equity. While our public company status provides us with some advantages over many of our competitors, including access to capital, we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that most of them do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements.

Following completion of our acquisition of Brakes Group, we are also a leading distributor of food and non-food products to the foodservice sector in Europe.  Our largest businesses in Europe are in the UK, France, Sweden and Ireland. Foodservice distribution is highly competitive in the different European countries. Across Europe, we face competition from other national broadline distributors, as well as a large number of regional, local and specialty distributors. We also compete against cash and carry stores, grocery stores, online retailers and logistics companies that offer foodservice distribution to our customers.

Government Regulation

Our company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions. In general, competition laws are designed to protect businesses and consumers from anti-competitive behavior.

In the U.S., as a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels, regulates food contact packaging and materials, and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption.

The recently published and pending rules under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) will significantly expand our food safety requirements. Among other things, we will be required to establish and maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated. The FSMA further regulates food products imported into the United States and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. In particular, the final rule on the sanitary transportation of food, which will become effective for Sysco in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, will require us to enhance certain of our systems to ensure that we meet the rule’s new standards for maintaining the safety of food during transportation.

We and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products.  Our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor.  These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute.

Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. We also must establish communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.

Our customers include several departments of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, as well as certain state and local entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.

We are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, which regulates transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste, and similar state, provincial and local agencies.  In addition, we are also subject to the U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state statutes, which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing retention of overpayments.


The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions.  The FCPA also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized.  We have implemented and continue to develop a robust anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anti-corruption laws in countries where we operate.

The U.S. Department of Transportation and its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations.

Outside the U.S., our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements. For example, as a result of our acquisition of the Brakes Group on July 5, 2016, we became subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the principal regions where Brakes conducts its business (including in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden (the Brakes Principal Regions)), as well as of the European Union, which requirements relate to, among other things, competition, product composition, packaging, labelling, advertisement and the safety of food products, as well as the health, safety and working conditions of employees.  In addition, following the acquisition of the Brakes Group, our business became subject to the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015, which requires certain companies that operate in the U.K. to prepare a report describing steps taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chain or business, as well as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, an anti-corruption law that restricts the offer or payment of anything of value to both government officials as well as to other non-governmental persons with the intent of gaining favorable government action, business or an advantage.

All of our company's facilities and other operations in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those in the U.S., the European Union and the Brakes Principal Regions, relating to: (1) the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater; (2) the discharge of pollutants into the air, including vehicle emissions; (3) proper handling, treatment and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; and (4) protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases.  Further, most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks (including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks).  Certain of these laws and regulations in the European Union and the Brakes Principal Regions may impose liability for costs (which could be material) of investigation or remediation of contamination regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal, and even if such contamination was present prior to the commencement of Brakes’ operations at the site and was not caused by its activities. In addition, many of our facilities have propane and battery powered forklifts. Proposed or recently enacted legal requirements, such as those requiring the phase-out of certain ozone-depleting substances, and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to upgrade or replace equipment, or may increase our transportation or other operating costs. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. We are subject to other federal, state, provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials; however, these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities.

General

We have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance, including the SYSCO

®

trademark and our privately-branded product trademarks that include the SYSCO

®

trademark. These trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry. Approximately half of our privately-branded sales are from products labeled with our SYSCO

®

trademark without any other trademark. We believe the loss of the SYSCO

®

trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our U.S. trademarks are effective for a ten-year period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use.  The company does not have any material patents or licenses.

We are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products.

Our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis; therefore, the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal.

As of

July 2, 2016

, we operated


distribution facilities throughout the U.S., Bahamas, Canada, and Ireland. We have 50% interests in operations in Costa Rica and Mexico.


Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business.  These factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements identified within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and from historical trends.

Industry and General Economic Risks

Periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability.

Volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry.  Periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our results of operations to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers.  In addition, periods of rapidly increasing inflation may negatively impact our business due to the timing needed to pass on such increases, the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current, highly competitive environment.  Conversely, our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation, because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin.  As a result, our results of operations may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant.

Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in the U.S., Canada and Europe, as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The foodservice distribution industry, which is characterized by relatively low profit margins with limited demand growth expected in the near-term, is especially susceptible to negative trends and economic uncertainty.  North America and Europe have each experienced an uneven economic environment over the past several years.  In addition, our results of operations are substantially affected by regional operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market.  Economic conditions can affect us in the following ways:

•

Unfavorable conditions can depress sales and/or gross margins in a given market.

•

Food cost and fuel cost inflation experienced by the consumer can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining

out and the amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases, which could negatively impact our business by reducing demand for our products.

•

Heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary

spending, which can cause disruptions with our customers and suppliers.

•

Liquidity issues and the inability of our customers, vendors and suppliers to consistently access credit markets

to obtain cash to support operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day

transactions involving the collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers.

The uncertainty in the economic environment has adversely affected the rate of improvement in both business and consumer confidence and spending, and uncertainty about the long-term investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity.

Economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the UK’s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The results of the referendum on June 23, 2016 in the United Kingdom (the UK) to exit the European Union (the EU) and to potentially otherwise significantly change its relationship with the EU and its laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the UK and EU countries could disrupt the overall stability of the EU given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual EU countries and otherwise negatively impact our European operations, including the Brakes Group.  If changes occur in laws and regulations impacting the flow of goods, services and workers between the UK and the EU, our European operations could also be negatively impacted.  If a country within the EU were to default on its debt or withdraw from the euro currency, or if the euro currency were to be dissolved entirely, the impact on markets around the world could be material. The completion of the UK’s exit from the EU could have less severe, but still significant, implications. Such exit could adversely


affect the value of our euro- and pound-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, such exit could cause financial and capital markets within and outside the EU to constrict, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business, and also could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact the foodservice distribution industry. Any one of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers, and makes it difficult for us to maintain our market share, growth rate and profitability

.

The foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive, with local, regional, multi-regional distributors and specialty competitors.  Local and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups, with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach, private label offerings, overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies, and ability to meet customer distribution requirements. These suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage, and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity.  Furthermore, barriers to entry by new competitors, or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors, are low.  Additionally, increased competition from non-traditional sources (such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures), cash and carry operations and group purchasing organizations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins, and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.    We also experience competition from online direct food wholesalers.  Finally, demand for food-away-from-home products is volatile and price sensitive, imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases.  New and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases, or may require increased discounting.  Such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion and/or make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers.

If we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  In addition, even if we are able to effectively differentiate ourselves, we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices, which could also adversely impact our results of operations.

We may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs, and forward purchase commitments intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs

.

Volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry.  We require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel.  The price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns.  The cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products, as well as the

costs we incur to deliver products to our customers.  Although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future.  If fuel costs increase in the future, we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers, which may have a negative impact on our results of operations.

We routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the then-current forward price for diesel.   In the future, we may also enter into other fuel hedging arrangements, including fuel derivatives, to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices.  There can be no assurance that our fuel hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices, and if fuel prices decrease significantly, these hedging arrangements would result in our paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel. In addition, our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk that one of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations, whether due to its insolvency or otherwise, which could result in financial losses.

Business and Operational Risks

Conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs

.

We obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third-party suppliers.  Although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested.  We are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases


in product costs based on conditions outside of our control.  These conditions include work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, short-term weather conditions or more prolonged climate change, crop and other agricultural conditions, water shortages, animal disease outbreaks, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, product recalls, competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events (including, but not limited to food-borne illnesses).  Further, increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products.  Input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period.  Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors.

Adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings

.

Maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business.  Sysco’s brand names, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them.  Anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products, whether or not justified, including adverse publicity about the quality, safety, sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to activities by our operations, employees, suppliers or agents could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as e-coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, salmonella, listeria or swine flu) or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact public confidence in our products.  If patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased.  In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns (even those unrelated to the use of Sysco products) or public concern regarding the safety of our products, can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our results of operations to decrease dramatically.

Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services.  This reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.  Our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity, including dissemination via print, broadcast or social media, or other forms of Internet-based communications.  Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image, undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce short-term or long-term demand for our products and

services, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Unfavorable changes to the mix of locally-managed customers versus corporate-managed customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Gross margin from our corporate-managed customers is generally lower than that of our locally-managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of value-added services than we do to locally-managed customers.  If sales to our locally-managed customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our corporate-managed customers, our operating margins may decline.

Moreover, if sales to our corporate-managed customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locally-managed customers, we will become more dependent on corporate-managed customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales.  Additionally, the loss of sales to the larger of these corporate-managed customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Additionally, as a result of our greater dependence on these customers, we could be pressured by them to lower our prices and/or offer expanded or additional services at the same prices.  In that event, if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions and/or cost increases, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  We may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment.

We may not be able to achieve our three-year financial targets by the end of fiscal year 2018.


In fiscal 2016, we set new three-year financial targets to grow operating income, accelerate earnings per share growth faster than operating income growth and improve return on invested capital.  Our ability to meet these financial targets depends largely on our successful execution of our business plan including various related initiatives. There are various risks related to these efforts, including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings, and the associated changes to our business, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. Our intentions and expectations with regard to the execution of our business plan, and the timing of any related initiatives, are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. If we are unable to successfully execute our business plan, whether due to our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our various business initiatives in the anticipated time frame or otherwise, we may be unable to achieve our three-year financial targets.

Expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges, and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful

.

An element of our strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations.  Our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations, of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future.  Risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.  Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations.

Another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to, but not currently part of, our core foodservice distribution business.  Our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject.  Risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business, which may require additional skills and competencies, as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets.

If the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness, or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations, we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims.

We, like any other foodservice distributor, may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness, to have been mislabeled, misbranded, or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations. We may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards, whether for taste, appearance, or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. Any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation, and/or lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by Sysco are alleged to have caused injury or illness.  We cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters.  Further, even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.  With respect to product liability claims, we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance.  However, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities.  We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers.  If Sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.


If we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations, we could become subject to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business

.

We are subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, international, national, provincial and local levels in many areas of our business, such as food safety and sanitation, transportation, minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour and employment discrimination, immigration, human health and safety, and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs.  For a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject, please refer to “Business - Government Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

From time to time, both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts, or otherwise.  We also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits.  While we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations.

If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, prohibitions on exporting, or seizures or debarments from contracting with the government.  The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including debarments, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations.

We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and we may be subject to substantial fines, penalties or third-party claims for non-compliance.

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:

•

the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, and water;

•

the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes;

•

employee exposure to hazards in the workplace; and

•

the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials.

In the course of our operations, we operate, maintain, and fuel fleet vehicles; store fuel in on-site above and underground storage tanks; operate refrigeration systems, and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including fines or penalties and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment. In addition, we could incur investigation, remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties.

We must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively

.

Historically, a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.  If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner, our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected.   Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise, or with a culture different from Sysco’s.  A significant expansion of our business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and operational resources.  Significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity, which could materially alter our debt-to-equity ratio, increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share, and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments.


We need access to borrowed funds to grow, and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity

.

A substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion.  We anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future. As a result, our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand.  Moreover, any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows, as well as the market value of our common stock.

Our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position

.

As described in Note 11, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements,” as of

July 2, 2016

, we had approximately

$7.4 billion

of total indebtedness which included a commercial paper program allowing us to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed

$1.5 billion

; a revolving credit facility supporting our United States and Canadian commercial paper programs in the amount of

$1.5 billion

scheduled to expire on

December 29, 2018

, and various other smaller bank facilities.

Our substantial amount of debt could have important consequences for us, including:

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes;

•

increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and

•

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

Our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions or joint ventures, and we expect to incur additional indebtedness to fund the repurchase of up to

$1.5 billion

in Sysco common stock under the $3 billion share repurchase program announced in

June 2015

.  Our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity, cost of future debt financing and financial results, and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness.  In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.

We rely on technology in our business and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could have a material negative impact on our business

.

Our ability to decrease costs and increase profits, as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively, depends on the reliability of our technology network.  We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to generate and select orders, to load and route trucks, to make purchases, to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis.  These systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches, cyber attacks, and viruses. Any such disruption to these software and other technology systems, or the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated, could adversely affect our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits.  While Sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations.  Additionally, information technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner. If our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do, such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

A cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers

.

We use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations.  We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, business partners and our customers.  Such uses give rise to


cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information.  Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ and suppliers' personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners.  Further, as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk.  If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.  Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective.  The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.

We may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans

.

We contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees.  Approximately

9%

of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans.  In fiscal


, our total contributions to these plans were approximately

$41.0 million

and there were no payments for withdrawal liabilities.  The costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years.  The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit.  Based upon the information available to us from plan administrators, we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded.  The unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers.  Underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions.  Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan.  Based on the latest information available from plan administrators, we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as

$225 million

as of

July 2, 2016

.  A significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our funding requirements for our company-sponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines

.

At the end of fiscal 2012, we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan) as of December 31, 2012 for all U.S. based salaried and non-union hourly employees.  Effective January 1, 2013, these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced, defined contribution plan.  While these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities, we had a sizable pension obligation of

$3.8 billion

as of

July 2, 2016

; therefore, financial market factors could impact our funding requirements.  Although recent pension funding relief legislation has served to defer some required funding, additional contributions may be required if our plan is not fully funded when the provisions that provided the relief are phased out.  See Note 14, “Company-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the Retirement Plan.

The amount of our annual contribution to the Retirement Plan is dependent upon, among other things, the returns on the Retirement Plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability.  Our Retirement Plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities.  Fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase.  The projected liability of the Retirement Plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements.  Specifically, decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse effect on our funding obligations.  To the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010, and/or interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline, our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

Failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages

.

As of

July 2, 2016

, approximately

8,953

employees at


operating companies were members of


different local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations.  In fiscal


,


a

greements covering approximately

1,800

em

ployees have expired or will expire.  Failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these


contracts could result in work stoppages.  Although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us.

A shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings

.

The future success of our operations, including the achievement of our strategic objectives, depends on our ability to identify, recruit, develop and retain qualified and talented individuals, and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business.  Our employee recruitment, development and retention efforts may not be successful, resulting in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods.  Any such shortage would decrease Sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives.  Such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our results of operations.

Our authorized preferred stock provides anti-takeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders

.

Under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Sysco’s Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to

1,500,000

s

hares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.  Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire Sysco without approval of the Board of Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued.  In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire Sysco without approval of the Board of Directors of Sysco, the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the Board of Directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer.  As a result, hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of Sysco, which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders, could be deterred.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities

The principal market for Sysco’s common stock (SYY) is the New York Stock Exchange.  The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices per share for our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends declared for the periods indicated.

The number of record owners of Sysco’s common stock as of

August 12, 2016

was

10,329

.

We made the following share repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal


:

(1)

The total number of shares purchased includes zero, 18,172, and 597 shares tendered by individuals in connection with stock option exercised in month #1, month #2, and month #3, respectively. All other shares were purchased pursuant to the publicly announced program described below.

In June


, our Board of Directors approved a repurchase program to repurchase from time to time in the open market, through an accelerated share repurchase program or through privately negotiated transactions, shares of the company's common stock in an amount not to exceed

$3.0 billion

during the two year period ending

July 1, 2017

, including $1.5 billion through an accelerated share repurchase that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal


, in addition to amounts normally repurchased to offset benefit plan and stock option dilution. Our accelerated share repurchase program was approved using a dollar value limit and, therefore, is not included in the table above for "Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans


or Programs."  We repurchased

34,716,180

shares under this plan in fiscal


.  In addition to this share repurchase program approved in June, in

August 2015

, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to

20,000,000

shares for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed

$800 million

.  The authorization expires on

August 21, 2017

.  Pursuant to the repurchase program, shares may be acquired in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the company’s discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. We purchased

10,000,000

shares under this authorization in fiscal 2016 and purchased an additional

5,607,003

shares through

August 12, 2016

.

The Board of Directors has authorized us to enter into agreements from time to time to extend our ongoing repurchase program to include repurchases during company announced “blackout periods” of such securities in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Our discussion below of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from restructuring charges, consisting of (1) severance charges, (2) facility closing costs, (3) professional fees incurred related to our three-year strategic plan and (4) expenses associated with the revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016.  It will also exclude acquisition-related expense resulting from (1) merger and integration planning, litigation costs and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods, Inc. (US Foods) and (2) transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of the parent holding company for the Brakes Group (the Brakes Acquisition), as well as the financing costs related to these acquisitions. Any costs related to the proposed merger with US Foods were applicable to us in our first quarter of fiscal


and prior periods.  These fiscal


and fiscal


items are collectively referred to as "Certain Items." Our US Foods financing costs related to senior notes that were issued in fiscal


to fund the proposed merger. These senior notes were redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal


and triggered a redemption loss of

$86.5 million

, and we incurred interest on the notes through the redemption date. With respect to adjusted return on invested capital targets, our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of any excess cash against our average debt amounts.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30

th

.  This resulted in a 53-week year ending

July 2, 2016

for fiscal


, and a 52 week year ending

June 27, 2015

and

June 28, 2014

for fiscal


and fiscal


, respectively. Because fiscal


contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2015, our Consolidated Results of Operations for fiscal 2016 are not directly comparable to the prior year.  Management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2016 Consolidated Results of Operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a year-over-year basis.  Sysco's results of operations and related metrics within this section will be disclosed on both a 53-week and 52-week basis for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.   This is calculated by taking one-fourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

Any metric within this section referred to as "adjusted" will reflect the applicable impact of both Certain Items and the extra week in fiscal 2016.  More information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to GAAP numbers can be found under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”

Overview

Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our primary operations are located throughout the United States (U.S.), Bahamas, Canada, Costa Rica, Ireland and Mexico and include Broadline companies, SYGMA (our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary), specialty produce companies, custom-cut meat companies, hotel supply operations, a company that distributes specialty imported products, a company that distributes to international customers and our Sysco Ventures platform, which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers.

We consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the U.S., Canada and Ireland and estimate that we serve about

16.4%

of this approximately

$295 billion

annual market based on a measurement as of the end of calendar


.  We use industry data obtained from various sources including Technomic, Inc., the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association and the Irish Food Board to calculate this measurement.  From time to time, these industry sources can revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and as result, our percentage can change not only from our sales results, but also from revisions.  According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-away-from-home, market represents approximately

49%

of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the U.S. as of the end of calendar


.

Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the U.S. experienced a real sales increase of approximately

2.3%

in calendar year


and

0.7%

in calendar year


.  Real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation.

Acquisition of Brakes Group

In February 2016, Sysco entered into a share sale and purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) to acquire Cucina Lux Investments Limited, the parent holding company of the Brakes Group (the "Brakes Acquisition"). On July 5, 2016, following the end of fiscal year 2016, Sysco closed the Brakes Acquisition. The consideration paid by Sysco in connection with the Brakes Acquisition was approximately

£2.3 billion

(approximately

$3.1 billion

based on exchange rates on July 5, 2016), and included the repayment of approximately

$2.3 billion

of the Brakes Group's then outstanding debt.  The purchase price was paid primarily in cash using the proceeds from recent debt issuances and other cash on hand, and is subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The Brakes Group is now wholly owned by Sysco.


The Brakes Group is a leading European foodservice business by revenue, supplying fresh, refrigerated and frozen food products, as well as non-food products and supplies, to more than 50,000 foodservice customers. The Brakes Group has leading market positions in the U.K., France, and Sweden, in addition to a presence in Ireland, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg. The Brakes Acquisition significantly strengthens Sysco's position as the world's leading foodservice distributor and offers attractive opportunities for organic growth and future expansion in European markets.

In the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Brakes Group’s sales were nearly $5 billion (£3.3 billion based on the weighted average exchange rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015), a 6.5% increase (in pounds sterling) from its previous fiscal year. The combined companies are expected to generate annualized sales of approximately $55 billion. We believe this acquisition will provide a solid platform for further acquisitions in Europe. The Brakes Acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Sysco’s earnings per share in fiscal 2017 contributing low to mid-single-digit percentage growth. In light of the recent closing of the Brakes Acquisition, we are in the early stages of the onboarding process with respect to the Brakes Group. Accordingly, for purposes of Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, the remaining discussion refers to the legacy Sysco business, excluding the impact of the Brakes Acquisition, except as otherwise noted.

Highlights

The general foodservice market environment since the beginning of fiscal


has been uneven, with a combination of both favorable and unfavorable trends reflected in the relevant data.  As compared to a few years ago, consumer confidence and unemployment data points were favorable through fiscal


and the beginning of fiscal


, while consumer spending on meals away from home has trended slightly downward towards the end of the fiscal year following gains throughout most of fiscal


.  Spending at restaurants was generally improved, but customer traffic levels were generally unchanged during fiscal 2016 and are beginning to decline, together with an overall moderation in spend.  Amid these conditions, throughout fiscal


we provided our customers with excellent service, growing our business with locally managed customers, improving our gross margins and managing expenses.  These are all important steps towards achieving our three-year plan financial objectives.

Trends

General economic conditions can affect consumer confidence and the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and our sales.  Lower fuel prices likely contributed to incremental consumer spending benefits and reduced our delivery costs; however, we experienced some demand softness in certain markets disproportionately impacted by the downturn in the energy industry in parts of Texas, Montana, North Dakota and Alberta, Canada.  Restaurant industry data reflects mixed trends with uneven sales during fiscal


.  Current sentiment for consumer spending on meals away from home has trended slightly downward recently.  Spending at restaurants was generally improved, but customer traffic levels were generally unchanged and are beginning to decline along with an overall moderation in spend.  Due to softening conditions for the restaurant environment, we expect modest case volume growth during the first half of fiscal 2017.

Our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price, volume and product mix. The modest level of growth in the foodservice market has created additional competitive pricing pressures, which is, in turn, negatively impacting sales and gross profits. Case growth with our locally managed Broadline business is needed to drive gross profit dollar growth. Our locally managed customers, including independent restaurant customers, comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes and an even greater percentage of profitability due to the high level of value added services we typically provide to this customer group. Through continued focus, our locally managed case volume growth has accelerated. Our sales to corporate-


managed customers, including chain restaurants and multi-locational restaurants, also comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes. Gross margin on sales to our corporate-managed customers is generally lower than on sales to other types of customers due to the higher volumes we sell to these customers. Case growth for our corporate-managed customers remained solid, but competitive pricing pressure has constrained our gross margins.  We offer an assortment of Sysco-branded products that we can differentiate from nationally-branded products, which enables us to achieve higher gross profits.  As a result, we focus on growing these products especially with locally-managed customers.  Inflation is a factor that contributes to the level of sales and gross profit growth and can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure. We experienced deflation at a rate of

0.7%

for fiscal


.  Deflation in fiscal


has occurred primarily in the meat, seafood, dairy and poultry categories for both periods, partially offset by modest inflation in other categories.  This is a significant decline from inflation of

3.7%

experienced in fiscal


.  We expect deflation to persist at least through the end of calendar


.  Rapid decreases in prices can make it challenging to leverage our fixed costs; however, the rate of deflation in fiscal


was moderate. Our focus on sales of Sysco branded items and our category management efforts have helped us to manage our gross margin performance in response to several of these factors.

The strong U.S. dollar has unfavorably impacted our foreign sales, operating income, and net earnings, as we convert them to U.S. dollars, primarily from our Canadian operations.  This trend has been present each quarter over the last year; therefore, the negative impact that we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we begin to compare against prior year periods where the relative value of our foreign currencies becomes increasingly similar to current exchange rates.

We have experienced higher operating expenses in fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


, that are attributable to higher case volumes and increased management incentive accruals.  Some of these incentives are based on Sysco's total shareholder return as compared to the S&P 500. Sysco's stock performance improved relative to the S&P 500 in fiscal


, resulting in higher accruals for these awards.  While these costs are increasing, certain of our expenses are declining, including indirect spend and fuel costs.  Indirect spend includes costs such as fleet maintenance and supplies.   An additional favorable impact resulted from the strong U.S. dollar, which is reducing our operating expenses as we convert foreign operating expenses to U.S. dollars.  We are also incurring Certain Items in fiscal


for restructuring costs, currently consisting of severance charges, professional fees incurred related to our three-year strategic plan and the impact of changes to our business technology strategy.  These Certain Items are contributing to our operating expenses in fiscal


and are likely to continue to contribute to our expenses in the near-term, as we review all aspects of our business for additional cost savings opportunities.

Interest expense for fiscal


increased

$51.3 million

as compared to fiscal


.  The increase was primarily due to the redemption of the senior notes issued in fiscal


to fund the merger that had been proposed with US Foods, partially offset by lower average debt levels in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal


.  In the second quarter of fiscal


, Sysco issued

$2.0 billion

in senior notes and proceeds of

$1.5 billion

were used to fund our accelerated share repurchase that reduced our share count in fiscal


.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal


, we issued

$2.5 billion

in senior notes and

€500 million

in senior notes to fund the Brakes Acquisition.  Sysco treated such interest expense incurred under these notes as a Certain Item because the use of the proceeds was for the Brakes Acquisition, which did not close until fiscal


.  Unless our borrowing needs change materially, we do not anticipate a similar level of increase in our interest expense in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  On an adjusted basis, interest expense will increase because the debt incurred in connection with the Brakes Acquisition will no longer be treated as a Certain Item in fiscal


.

The number of our outstanding shares has decreased as a result of our $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.  This represented half of our previously announced

$3.0 billion

share repurchase program.  This generated an approximate

$0.05

per share benefit for fiscal


.  We intend to execute the remaining

$1.5 billion

in share repurchases in fiscal


through open market purchases, an accelerated share repurchase or otherwise and believe this will provide an earnings per share benefit of approximately

$0.03

to

$0.04

per share in fiscal


, driven by a reduction in average shares outstanding.

Strategy

We are focused on optimizing our core foodservice business with a customer centric approach, while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share in established markets, expand our core business to new geographical regions and markets and create shareholder value by expanding beyond our core business.  We are executing on our strategy by expanding our operational reach in Europe through the Brakes Acquisition.  Day-to-day, our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver quality products to our customers with exceptional service, with the aspirational vision of becoming our customers’ most valued and trusted business partner.  We have identified five components of our strategy to help us achieve our mission and vision as follows:

•

Partnership - Profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with Sysco:  Our primary focus is to help our customers succeed.  We believe that by building on our current competitive advantages, we will be able to further differentiate our offering to customers.  Our competitive advantages include our sales force of over

7,600

marketing


associates; our diversified product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand products; the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis; and our multi-regional presence in the U.S. and Canada.  In addition, we have a portfolio of businesses spanning Broadline, chain restaurant distribution, specialty produce, specialty meat, hotel amenities, specialty import and export which serves our customers’ needs across a wide array of business segments.  Through our Sysco Ventures platform, we are developing a suite of technology solutions that help support the administrative needs of our customers.  We believe this strategy of enriching the experience of doing business with Sysco will increase customer retention and profitably accelerate sales growth with both existing and new customers.

•

Productivity - Continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business:  We continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs.  From modernizing software systems to leveraging the power of our end-to-end supply chain, we continue to look for ways to improve our service to our customers and lower costs.

•

Products - Enhance our portfolio of products and services by initiating a customer-centric innovation program:  We continually explore opportunities to provide new and improved products, technologies and services to our customers.

•

People - Leverage talent, structure, and culture to drive performance:  Our ability to drive results and grow our business is directly linked to having the best talent in the industry.  We are committed to the continued enhancement of our talent management programs in terms of how we recruit, select, train and develop our associates throughout Sysco, as well as succession planning.  Our ultimate objective is to provide our associates with outstanding opportunities for professional growth and career development.

•

Portfolio - Explore, assess and pursue new businesses and markets: This strategy is focused on identifying opportunities to expand the core business through growth in new international markets and in adjacent areas that complement our core foodservice distribution business.  As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions, joint ventures and sales of assets and businesses.

In fiscal


, we set three-year financial targets to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018:

•

Improve operating income by at least

$500 million

;

•

Grow earnings per share faster than operating income; and

•

Achieve 15% in return on invested capital improvement for existing businesses.

The key levers to achieve these goals include an emphasis on accelerating locally managed customer case growth, improve margins, leverage supply chain costs and reduce administrative costs.  We do not expect our improvements to occur evenly on a quarterly basis.  We exceeded our

20%

to

30%

of our adjusted operating income improvement goal in fiscal


and in fiscal


, our goal is to achieve 50% to 60% of our cumulative adjusted operating income target.  Return on invested capital improvements include goals to improve our working capital by four days through improved management of working capital, specifically from the combined impact of accounts receivables, inventory and accounts payable. Our underlying assumptions in achieving these financial targets include reinvesting in our business, moderate growth in our dividend, reducing diluted shares outstanding through our previously announced

$3.0 billion

share buyback program, half of which has been completed and the other half is expected to occur in fiscal


, and repurchasing shares to offset any new share issuances from employee equity compensation and pursuing investments through acquisitions.

During fiscal


, we delivered the following results against these objectives as compared to fiscal


:

•

Total cases grew

5.0%

in our Broadline business, and local cases grew

4.7%

;

3.0%

and

2.7%

on a comparable 52-week basis, respectively;

•

We grew gross profit by

$489.0 million

, expanded gross margin by


basis points, and gross profit grew faster than total operating expenses;

•

Operating income grew by

50.5%

and adjusted operating income grew by

9.6%

; and

•

Diluted earnings per share grew

42.6%

and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew

12.0%

.

See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for an explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

Revised Technology Strategy

In fiscal


, Sysco announced its revised business technology strategy focused on improving the customer experience. In refocusing its technology approach, Sysco is modernizing and adding new capability and functionality to its existing SUS Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. In connection with this strategy, Sysco plans to remove the SAP ERP platform


currently used by 12 of its operating companies by the end of fiscal 2017. We believe this new approach to our business technology strategy enables us to achieve our original business transformation objectives sooner, at a lower cost, with less risk, and provides a better user experience for our customers and operating companies. Our technology efforts going forward are expected to be increasingly directed toward developing customer-facing tools and systems, such as a digital ordering platform, that add value to our customers’ overall experience with Sysco.  Additionally, we will continue to develop integrated systems that enable the use of shared services across the enterprise.  Sysco expects to realize significant technology cost savings once the conversion to the SUS ERP is completed in fiscal


.  A portion of these savings will be reinvested in optimizing the company’s technology platform to better serve customers.  In addition, the company incurred expenses of approximately $78.5 million in fiscal


related to write-offs, accelerated depreciation and conversion costs resulting from the changes in technology strategy. Incremental depreciation expenses, recognized in fiscal


were

$73.5 million

, consisted of $

31.6 million

of unfinished projects previously capitalized on the consolidated balance sheet within construction in progress and $

41.9 million

in accelerated depreciation. We expect to incur expenses of approximately

$130 million

in fiscal


primarily from accelerated depreciation and conversion costs.

General and Administrative Productivity Plan

In fiscal


, Sysco began a productivity plan that includes a reduction in its workforce by approximately 2%, or 1,200 positions, by the end of fiscal


. The primary focus of this reduction is on administrative, non-customer-facing roles. Sysco expects to record charges for severance and related benefit costs of $25 million to $30 million through the end of fiscal


. Charges recognized in fiscal


were $17.0 million.  We also designed a new market structure for our U.S. Broadline operations that reduced the number of markets from eight to six effective at the beginning of fiscal


. This change builds on our functional expertise and further improves the effectiveness of each team, while reducing administrative costs, improving efficiency through standardization of processes and improving execution of our three-year financial plan.

Results

of Operations

The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated:


The following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year:

(1)

Other expense (income), net was expense of $

111.3 million

in fiscal


and income of $

33.6 million

in fiscal


.

Sales

The following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change.

Sales for fiscal


were

3.5%

higher than fiscal


, respectively.  The largest drivers of the increases were the extra week that was applicable in fiscal 2016, case volume growth and sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months. We estimate that the extra week contributed

2.0%

of the

3.5%

sales growth.  Case volumes for the company's U.S. Broadline operations improved

5.3%

in fiscal


compared to fiscal


and included a

4.7%

improvement in locally managed customer case growth. We estimate that the extra week contributed

2.0%

to both the U.S. Broadline operations and locally managed customer case growth.  Partially offsetting this growth were unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars.  Other items impacting the change in sales, but to a lesser extent, were pricing management of product cost deflation and product mix.

Sales for fiscal


were

4.7%

higher than fiscal


.  The largest drivers of the increases were case volume growth and inflation, which is included in "Other" in the table above.  Changes in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, were estimated as inflation of

3.7%

during fiscal


, driven mainly by inflation in the meat, seafood and dairy categories.  Case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved

2.6%

in fiscal


.  Case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved

2.4%

in fiscal


.  Our case volumes represent our results from our Broadline


and SYGMA segments combined.  The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by

1.0%

in fiscal


.

Operating Income

Cost of sales primarily includes our product costs, net of vendor consideration, and includes in-bound freight.  Operating expenses include the costs of facilities, product handling, delivery, selling and general and administrative activities.  Fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit; fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses.

Fiscal


vs. Fiscal


The following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year:

The increase in operating income and adjusted operating income for fiscal


was impacted by gross profit growth exceeding operating expense growth.  The increase in operating income during fiscal


also reflected a lower amount of Certain Items as compared to fiscal


.  An additional unfavorable impact resulted from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which reduced our foreign operating income as we converted those amounts to U.S. dollars. More information on the rationale for the use of these adjusted measures and reconciliations can be found under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”

Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


, primarily due to the extra week in fiscal 2016, higher sales volumes, including a more beneficial mix of local customer case growth, higher sales of Sysco branded products to local customers, benefits of category management and revenue management and effective management of deflation. We estimate that the extra week contributed 2.1% of the 5.7% gross profit growth.  Our focus on center of plate categories, such as beef, pork and poultry, and our emphasis on fresh produce helped drive gross profit growth. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of sales, was

17.95%

in fiscal


, an improvement of


basis points from the gross margin of

17.57%

in fiscal


.  Our case growth for Sysco brand sales to local customers increased 82 basis points for fiscal


. The change in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, was estimated as deflation of

0.7%

for fiscal


.  Of those amounts, our U.S. Broadline operations experienced deflation of

0.9%

.  Deflation in these fiscal


periods has occurred primarily in the meat, seafood, dairy and poultry categories for both periods, partially offset by modest inflation in other categories.

Operating expenses for fiscal


decreased

1.8%

, or $

132.2 million

, over fiscal


. Adjusted operating expenses for fiscal


increased

2.0%

, or

$137.6 million

, over fiscal


.  Both operating expenses and adjusted operating expenses were increased by the additional week in fiscal 2016.  We estimate that the extra week contributed

2.0%

to these operating expense metrics.  The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a lower level of Certain Items primarily from lower acquisition-related costs.  The increase in adjusted operating expenses for fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from expenses attributable to higher case volumes and increased management incentive accruals.  These increases were partially offset by reduced expenses in indirect spend and fuel costs and administrative expense. Indirect spend includes costs such as fleet maintenance and supplies.  An additional favorable impact resulted from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which is reducing our operating expenses as we convert foreign operating expenses to U.S. dollars.


Operating Expenses Impacting Adjusted Operating Income

Pay-related expenses represent a significant portion of our operating costs, and can increase due to volume growth, increased incentive expenses, acquisitions and pay increases, among other factors. These expenses increased by $

199.5 million

in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


due primarily to case volume increases and companies acquired within the last 12 months.   Our pay-related expenses increased $131.7 million primarily due to improved case volumes for fiscal


.   Long-term incentive accruals increased

$38.5 million

.  Some of these incentives are based on Sysco's total shareholder return as compared to the S&P 500 and Sysco's stock performance improved relative to the S&P 500 in fiscal


, which increased the expense associated with these awards.  Our expense related to management incentive accruals will vary based on how the company’s performance compares to incentive targets.  Acquired companies added

$29.4 million

to the pay-related expense totals for fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.

Several factors contributed to reductions in operating expenses, including reduced indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation.  Total fuel costs decreased by

$68.0 million

in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  The decrease was primarily due to lower prices for diesel.  We do not expect this level of decrease in fiscal


due to pricing we have locked with fixed forward contracts.  Due to a stronger U.S. dollar, foreign exchange translation aided in the year over year comparison of operating expenses by

$86.9 million

.

Cost per case is an important metric management uses to measure our expense performance. This metric is calculated by dividing the total operating expense of our U.S. Broadline companies by the number of cases sold. Adjusted cost per case is calculated similarly; however, the operating expense component excludes restructuring costs consisting of severance charges, which are the Certain Items applicable to these companies, divided by the number of cases sold.  Our corporate expenses are not included in the cost per case metrics because the metric is a measure of efficiency in our operations.  Our U.S. Broadline operations represented approximately

70%

of Sysco's sales and nearly

65%

of our operating expenses prior to corporate expenses in both fiscal


and fiscal


. We seek to grow our sales and reduce our costs on a per case basis. Our cost per case and adjusted cost per case decreased

$0.04

per case fiscal


as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal


.  The decrease reflects progress in productivity improvements and cost reductions in our supply chain including reduced fuel costs and indirect spend. The decrease attributable to lower fuel prices was

$0.04

benefit per case.  Adjustments to operating expenses were not large enough to produce a different result on an adjusted cost per case basis for fiscal


.  Additionally, the extra week in fiscal 2016 was not large enough to produce a different result on a 52-week basis.

Certain Items within Operating Expenses

Sysco’s operating expenses are impacted by Certain Items, which are expenses that can be difficult to predict, can be unanticipated or do not represent core operating expenses. More information on the rationale for the use of adjusted measures and reconciliations to GAAP numbers can be found under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations.” Certain Item costs totaled $

158.7 million

in fiscal


.  Certain Items for fiscal


consisted of restructuring costs related to our revised business technology strategy, severance charges, professional fees incurred related to our three-year strategic plan, and acquisition-related costs and loss on foreign currency remeasurement and hedging. Costs associated with our revised business technology strategy were

$73.5 million

, consisting of $

31.6 million

of unfinished projects previously capitalized on the consolidated balance sheet and $

41.9 million

in accelerated depreciation. Professional fees and severance largely related to our three-year strategic plan totaled

$43.3 million

in fiscal


.  Loss on foreign currency remeasurement and hedging related to the Brakes Acquisition totaled

$147.0 million

. Certain of these types of expenses, such as restructuring costs, are likely to continue in the near-term as we review all aspects of our business for additional cost savings opportunities.  Additionally, we will incur additional costs to onboard the Brakes Group into our operations.

Certain Items for fiscal


related primarily to integration planning and transaction costs incurred in connection with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods, including merger termination costs.  Certain Item costs totaled

$562.5 million

for fiscal


.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased

$51.3 million

for fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


, primarily due to the redemption of the senior notes issued in fiscal


to fund the merger that had been proposed with US Foods.  These senior notes were redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal


and triggered a redemption loss of

$86.5 million

.  This increase was partially offset by lower average debt levels in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  We incurred interest costs from financing the Brakes Acquisition in the last half of fiscal


.  In fiscal


, we incurred interest costs related to the proposed merger with US Foods.  Interest costs related to these proposed acquisitions as well and the redemption costs noted above are considered Certain Items. Our interest


expense, excluding Certain Items, increased

$61.8 million

as compared to fiscal 2015, due to higher borrowing levels from senior notes that were issued in fiscal


primarily for our accelerated share repurchase program.

Other Income and Expense, Net

Other income and expense, net increased

$144.9 million

for fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


, primarily from the remeasurement of foreign denominated cash and losses of foreign currency option contracts.  Both of these related to our purchase price for the acquisition of the Brakes Group, which closed shortly after our fiscal year end.

Fiscal


vs. Fiscal


The following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year:

The decrease in operating income was impacted by an increase of

$416.0 million

in operating expenses attributable to Certain Items.  Adjusted operating income increased due to gross profit dollar growth partially offset by increased expenses from greater case volumes, higher incentive accruals, higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investment in administrative support capabilities and acquired operations.

Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


primarily due to increased sales volumes, stronger relative mix of sales to our locally-managed customers and benefits from category management.  Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of sales, was

17.57%

in fiscal


, a decline of


basis points from the gross margin of

17.59%

in fiscal


.  Increased competition resulting from a slow-growth market and volatile inflation has pressured our gross margins; however, sales and mix, as well as our category management initiative helped us stabilize our gross margin performance.  Inflation in fiscal


was

3.7%

, an increase from

2.1%

experienced in fiscal


.  Our inflation rates were higher in the first half of fiscal


, reaching

6.0%

at the mid-point of the fiscal year and dropping to

0.1%

by the end of the fiscal year.  Fiscal


inflation was seen primarily in the meat, dairy and poultry categories.

Operating expenses for fiscal


increased

11.0%

, or

$728.2 million

, over fiscal


.  Adjusted operating expenses for fiscal


increased

4.9%

, or

$315.6 million

, over fiscal


.  These increases in adjusted operating expenses were primarily due to increased expenses from greater case volumes, higher incentive accruals, higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investment in administrative support capabilities and acquired operations.  Partially offsetting this increase, was a reduction in fuel costs and provisions for losses on receivables. Sysco’s operating expenses were impacted by Certain Items, which resulted in an increase in operating expenses of

$416 million

in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  More information on the rationale of the use of adjusted operating expense and adjusted operating income and reconciliations to GAAP numbers can be found under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”

Operating Expenses Impacting Adjusted Operating Income

Our operating expenses increased in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


partially due to greater case volumes, higher incentive accruals, higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investment in administrative support capabilities and acquired operations.  Pay-related expenses, which represent a significant portion of our operating costs,

increased

by

$349.3 million

in fiscal


over fiscal


.  Factors contributing to the increase in


include increase in expense related to management incentive accruals of

$103.5 million

, higher pay in our sales organization largely as a result of higher gross profits, higher costs due to investment in new administrative support capabilities and companies acquired in the last 12 months. The amounts for companies acquired within the last 12 months include our new, consolidated joint ventures, such as our 50% interest


in a foodservice company in Costa Rica. Sales and gross profit growth partially contributed to an increase in sales pay-related expenses due to increases in sales commissions and bonuses.  In addition, we had increased our marketing associate headcount in certain markets in order to invest in future sales growth.  Our fiscal


financial performance trended more favorably relative to the applicable management incentive targets as compared to fiscal


.  Consequently, expense is higher period over period.

Our U.S. Broadline cost per case and adjusted cost per case increased

$0.08

per case in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  The increase occurred primarily from increased pay-related expenses.  Adjustments to operating expenses were not large enough to produce a different result on an adjusted cost per case basis for fiscal 2015.

Certain Items within Operating Expenses

Sysco’s operating expenses are impacted by Certain Items, which are expenses that can be difficult to predict, can be unanticipated or do not represent core operating expenses.  More information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to GAAP numbers can be found under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”   Our significant Certain Items applicable for fiscal


included costs related to integration planning, litigation costs and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods.  Our significant Certain Items applicable for fiscal


related to costs in connection with the then proposed merger with US Foods, a change in estimate of our self-insurance reserve and a liability for a settlement.

We incurred costs in connection with the proposed merger with US Foods announced in the second quarter of fiscal


primarily from integration planning, litigation costs and termination costs.  These costs totaled

$554.7 million

in fiscal


and

$90.6 million

in fiscal


.

Our self-insurance program covers portions of workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability and property insurance costs.  The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers.  Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.  In the second quarter of fiscal


, based on the historical trends of increased costs primarily attributable to our workers' compensation claims, we

increase

d our estimates of our self-insurance reserve to a higher point in an estimated range of liability as opposed to our past position at the lower end of the range.  This resulted in a charge of

$23.8 million

in fiscal


.

During the first quarter of fiscal


, Sysco was made aware of certain alleged violations of California law relating to its use of remote storage units in the delivery of products.  These are commonly referred to as drop sites.  As of

June 28, 2014

, we recorded a liability for a settlement of

$20 million

.  In July 2014, Sysco agreed to a

$19.4 million

settlement, which includes a payment of

$15.0 million

in penalties,

$3.3 million

to fund four California Department of Public Health investigator positions for five years, a

$1.0 million

donation to food banks across California, and

$0.1 million

in legal fees.  In the first quarter of fiscal


, we eliminated the use of drop sites across Sysco.  During fiscal


, we introduced mandatory, annual food safety training for all employees across Sysco.

Net Earnings

Net earnings increased

38.3%

in fiscal


from fiscal


due primarily to the items noted above and the beneficial impact from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies. Items impacting our income taxes from effective tax rates are discussed in

Note 20

,

"Income Taxes"

.  Adjusted net earnings increased

8.0%

in fiscal


primarily from gross profit growth, strong expense management and the favorable resolutions of tax contingencies.  Our tax rate can be positively or negatively influenced by events such as the occurrence or resolution of tax contingencies; however, we expect a normalized tax rate of 35% to 36% for the remainder of fiscal


, which represents a decrease due to the recent Brakes Acquisition.  An additional unfavorable impact on our net earnings and adjusted net earnings resulted from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which reduced both amounts by

$11.5 million

for fiscal 2016 as we converted foreign earnings to U.S. dollars.

Net earnings

decrease

d

26.3%

in fiscal


from fiscal


due primarily to the changes in operating income discussed above, including the impact of Certain Items, which included increased interest expense of

$131.6 million

in fiscal


that related to the financing of our proposed merger with US Foods.  These amounts include the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs when our bridge acquisition facility was terminated upon the issuance of our senior notes in October 2014 and interest expense on those senior notes.  Excluding this interest expense, adjusted interest expense decreased by

$0.6 million

.  Adjusted net earnings increased

$66.3 million

, or

6.4%

, during fiscal


.   Items impacting our income taxes from effective tax rates are discussed in

Note 20

.


Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share in fiscal


were

$1.66

, a

43.1%

increase from the fiscal


amount of

$1.16

per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal


were

$1.64

, a

42.6%

increase from the fiscal


amount of

$1.15

. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal


were

$2.06

, a

12.0%

increase from the fiscal


amount of

$1.84

. These results were primarily due to the factors discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding shares that resulted from our accelerated share repurchase program, which generated and an approximate five cent per share benefit for fiscal


.

Basic earnings per share in fiscal


were

$1.16

, a

27.0%

decrease from the fiscal


amount of

$1.59

per share.  Diluted earnings per share in fiscal


were

$1.15

, a

27.2%

decrease from the fiscal


amount of

$1.58

per share.  This decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above and due to greater shares outstanding during fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  As discussed below in “liquidity and capital resources - financing activities,” we chose not to repurchase any shares in fiscal 2015 due to the proposed US Foods merger.  Our shares outstanding had increased primarily as a result of stock option exercises and restricted stock unit grants to employees.  This resulted in lowering our earnings per share amounts by $0.02 per share in fiscal


.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal


were

$1.84

, an increase of 5.1% from the comparable prior year period amount of $1.75.

As noted in our Trends discussion above, our accelerated share repurchases that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal


favorably impacted our fiscal


earnings per share.  We intend to execute the remaining $1.5 billion in share repurchases in fiscal


through open market purchases, an accelerated share repurchase or otherwise and believe this will provide an earnings per share benefit of approximately

$0.03

to

$0.04

per share in fiscal


, driven by a reduction in average shares outstanding.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations

Sysco’s consolidated results of operations are impacted by certain items which include restructuring charges, consisting of (1) severance charges, (2) facility closing costs, (3) professional fees incurred related to our three-year strategic plan and (4) expenses associated with the revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016.  It will also exclude acquisition-related expense resulting from (1) merger and integration planning, litigation costs and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods, Inc. (US Foods) and (2) transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of the parent holding company for the Brakes Group (the Brakes Acquisition), as well as the financing costs related to these acquisitions. Any costs related to the proposed merger with US Foods were applicable to us in our first quarter of fiscal


and prior periods.  These fiscal


and fiscal


items are collectively referred to as "Certain Items."  Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, interest expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company's underlying operations and facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis and (2) removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated, and which as a result, are difficult to include in analysts' financial models and our investors' expectations with any degree of specificity.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 53-week year ending

July 2, 2016

for fiscal


and 52-week year ending

June 27, 2015

for fiscal


.  Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal


, our consolidated results of operations for fiscal


are not directly comparable to the prior year.  Management believes that adjusting the fiscal


consolidated results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a year-over-year basis.  As a result, the metrics from the consolidated results of operations for fiscal


presented in the table below are adjusted by one-fourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter.  Failure to make these adjustments causes the year-over-year changes in certain metrics such as sales, operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be overstated, whereas in certain cases, a metric may actually have declined on a more comparable year-over-year basis.

The company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. As a result, in the table below, each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above.  In the table below, individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.



(1)

Includes severance charges, professional fees on 3 year financial objectives, facility closure costs and costs associated with our revised business technology strategy.

(2)

Includes US Foods merger and integration planning and transaction costs (first quarter 2016 and fiscal 2015 only) and Brakes Acquisition transaction costs (third and fourth quarter fiscal 2016 only).

(3)

Includes US Foods financing costs (first quarter 2016 and fiscal 2015 only) and Brakes Acquisition financing costs (third  and fourth quarter fiscal 2016 only).

(4)

The tax impact of adjustments for Certain Items are calculated based on jurisdiction by multiplying the pretax impact of each Certain Item by the statutory rates in effect for each jurisdiction. As a result, the effective rate for each Certain Item may differ based on the jurisdiction where the Certain Item was incurred.

(5)

Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding.  Total diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.

NM represent that the percentage change was not meaningful.

Case Growth

Case growth is impacted by the extra week in fiscal 2016.  This amount is adjusted out of the measures presented above to remove the extra week for comparability purposes for the same underlying reasons the extra week is excluded from the measures presented above.  The table that follows provides a reconciliation of case growth to remove the impact of the extra week.

Segment Results

We have aggregated certain of our operating companies into

two

reporting segments, Broadline and SYGMA, as defined in the accounting literature related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise. The Broadline reportable segment is an aggregation of the company’s Broadline segments located in the Bahamas, Canada, Costa Rica, Ireland, Mexico and the United States.  Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. "Other" financial information is attributable to the company's other operating segments, including the company's specialty produce, custom-cut meat operations, lodging industry segments, a company that distributes specialty imported products,  a company that distributes to international customers and the company’s Sysco Ventures platform, which includes a suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of Sysco’s customers. Intersegment sales primarily represent products the Broadline and SYGMA operating companies procured from the specialty produce, custom-cut meat operations, an imported specialty products company and a company that distributes to international customers.  In fiscal


, our segment reporting will change due to the inclusion of the Brakes Group; however, at this time, we have not determined how the segments will change.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results. Corporate expenses generally include all expenses of the corporate office and Sysco’s shared services center. These also include all share-based compensation costs. While a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the short-term by increases or decreases in gross profits, expenses, or a combination thereof, over the long-term each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth. This is consistent with our long-term goal of increasing earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth.

The following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with

Note 22

,

"Business Segment Information"

:


The following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year and should be read in conjunction with

Note 22

,

"Business Segment Information"

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in item 8:

(1)

SYGMA had operating income of $

27.7

million in fiscal


, $

20.5

million in fiscal


and $

38.0

million in fiscal


.

The following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments, the other segment, and intersegment sales, expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales, including intersegment sales, and operating income, respectively. For purposes of this statistical table, operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses of $

1.2 billion

in fiscal


,

$1.5 billion

in fiscal


and

$1.0 billion

in fiscal


that are not charged to our segments. This information should be read in conjunction with

Note 22

,

"Business Segment Information"

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in item 8:

Broadline Segment

The Broadline reportable segment is an aggregation of the company’s Broadline operations located in the Bahamas, Canada, Costa Rica, Ireland, Mexico and the United States.  Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served.  Broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of Sysco’s operations.  In fiscal


, the Broadline operating results represented approximately

79.2%

of Sysco’s overall sales and

93.9%

of the aggregated operating income of Sysco’s segments, which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments.

There are several factors that contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the SYGMA and Other operating segments.  We have invested substantial amounts in assets, operating methods, technology and management expertise in this segment.  The breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to benefit from this segment’s earnings.

Sales

The following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of the change.


Sales were

3.2%

higher in fiscal


than in the comparable period of the prior year.  The largest drivers of the increases were the extra week that was applicable in fiscal 2016, case volume growth and sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months.  We estimate that the extra week contributed

2.0%

of the

3.2%

sales growth.  Case volumes for the company's U.S. Broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved

5.3%

in fiscal


compared to fiscal


and included a

4.7%

improvement in locally managed customers' case growth.  We estimate that the extra week contributed

2.0%

of the

5.3%

case growth.  Partially offsetting this growth were unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars.  Other items impacting the change in sales, but to a lesser extent, were pricing management of product cost deflation and product mix.

Sales for fiscal


were

5.0%

higher than fiscal


.  The largest drivers of the increases were case volume growth and inflation, which are included in "Other" in the table above. Changes in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, were estimated as inflation of

3.7%

during fiscal


, driven mainly by inflation in the meat, seafood and dairy categories.  The exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by

1.0%

in fiscal 2015.

Operating Income

Fiscal


vs Fiscal


Operating income increased by

10.3%

in fiscal


over fiscal


, primarily due to the extra week applicable to fiscal 2016, higher gross profits, partially offset by higher operating expenses attributable to higher case volumes. We estimate that the extra week contributed

2.3%

of the

10.3%

operating income growth.  Our gross profits grew at a faster pace than operating expenses, reflecting favorable expense management.

Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


primarily due to the extra week in fiscal


, sales volumes, including a more beneficial mix of local customer case growth, higher sales of Sysco branded products to local customers, benefits of category management and revenue management and effective management of deflation. Our focus on center of plate categories, such as beef, pork and poultry, and our emphasis on fresh produce helped drive gross profit growth.  Our case growth for Sysco brand sales to local customers increased 82 basis points for fiscal


. The change in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, was estimated as deflation of

0.8%

during fiscal


for our operating companies in this segment.  Deflation in fiscal


occurred primarily in the meat, seafood, dairy and poultry categories for both periods, partially offset by modest inflation in other categories.

Operating expenses increased in


, as compared to fiscal


, primarily due to the extra week in fiscal


and expenses attributable to higher case volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced indirect spend and fuel costs and administrative expense. Indirect spend includes costs such as fleet maintenance and supplies. An additional favorable impact resulted from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which is reducing our operating expenses as we convert foreign operating expenses to U.S. dollars. Our cost per case and adjusted cost per case decreased

$0.04

per case fiscal


as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal


.  The decrease reflects progress in productivity improvements and cost reductions in our supply chain including reduced fuel costs and indirect spend. The decrease attributable to lower fuel prices was

$0.04

benefit per case. Adjustments to operating expenses were not large enough to produce a different result on an adjusted cost per case basis for fiscal


. Additionally, the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 was not large enough to produce a different result on a 52-week basis.


Fiscal


vs. Fiscal


Operating income

increase

d by

5.8%

in fiscal


over fiscal


.  We experienced growth in our gross profits due to increased sales volumes, stronger relative mix of sales for our locally-managed customers and benefits from our category management initiative.  Operating expenses increased from greater case volumes, higher incentive accruals, higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investment in administrative support capabilities and acquired operations..

Gross profits increased in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


and gross margins were steady. Increased competition resulting from a slow-growth market and volatile inflation pressured our gross margins; however, sales and mix, as well as our category management initiative, helped us stabilize our gross margin performance. Our inflation rates were higher in the first half of fiscal


, reaching levels of

6%

at the mid-point of the fiscal year and dropping to minimal amounts by the end of the fiscal year. Fiscal


inflation was seen primarily in the meat, dairy and poultry categories.

Operating expenses for the Broadline segment

increase

d in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  The increase in expenses for fiscal


as compared to fiscal


was driven largely by higher sales costs, increased expense related to management incentive accruals and costs from companies acquired within the last 12 months. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in fuel costs. Sales and gross profit growth partially contributed to an increase in sales pay-related expenses due to increases in sales commissions and bonuses. In addition, we had increased our marketing associate headcount in certain markets in order to invest in future sales growth. Our U.S. Broadline cost per case and adjusted cost per case increased

$0.08

per case in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  The increase occurred primarily from increased pay-related expenses.  Adjustments to operating expenses were not large enough to produce a different result on an adjusted cost per case basis for fiscal


.

SYGMA Segment

SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations.

Sales

Sales were

0.4%

higher in fiscal


than in fiscal


.  The increase for fiscal


was primarily due to the extra week within fiscal


, organic customer growth and the addition of new customers. Partially offsetting these increases were lost and strategically resigned business, product cost deflation and lower fuel surcharges. SYGMA intends to add business with new and existing customers to profitably grow this segment's results.

Sales were

1.6%

lower in fiscal


than in fiscal


.  The decrease was primarily due to lost and strategically resigned business and lower fuel surcharges.  Partially offsetting these decreases were increases from product cost inflation (and the resulting increase in selling prices) and case volume increases from existing customers.

Operating Income

Operating income increased by

34.8%

in fiscal


from fiscal


, primarily driven by improved operating performance in addition to the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016.  Gross profit dollars increased

6.7%

, while operating expenses increased

2.1%

in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  Gross profit dollar growth was higher due to improved product margins excluding fuel surcharges and the extra week within fiscal 2016.  Operating expenses decreased in fiscal


largely due to reduced transportation costs reflecting improved retention of drivers and lower fuel costs. Both transportation and warehouse costs, including pay-related expenses, improved from improved expense management and improved productivity.

Operating income decreased by

46.1%

in fiscal


from fiscal


.  Gross profit dollars decreased

3.3%

while operating expenses increased

7.3%

in fiscal


over fiscal


.  Gross profit dollar growth was lower primarily due to reduced fuel surcharges, the impact of strategically resigned business and lower margins, as a result of the competitive market environment.  Operating expenses increased in fiscal


due to increased warehouse and delivery costs, including pay-related expenses, partially resulting from efforts to increase driver retention, manage warehouse employee shortages and stabilize operations after the business losses and resignations.

Other Segment

“Other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments, including our specialty produce, our custom-cut meat operations, our lodging industry products segments, a company that distributes specialty imported products, a company that distributes to international customers and our Sysco Ventures platform, our suite of technology solutions that help support the


business needs of our customers.  These operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature.

On an aggregate basis, our “Other” segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than Sysco’s Broadline segment.  Sysco has acquired some of the operating companies within this segment in recent years. These operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry, except for our lodging industry supply company. Each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average Broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the Broadline segment. In fiscal


, in the aggregate, the “Other” segment represented approximately

11.8%

of Sysco’s overall sales and

5.2%

of the aggregate operating income of Sysco’s segments, which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments.

Operating income increased

15.9%

, or $

21.6 million

in fiscal


compared to fiscal


. The increase was primarily attributable to the extra week applicable to fiscal 2016 and favorable results from our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments and improvements in results from other businesses in the early stage of operations in this segment.

Operating income decreased

4.6%

, or $

6.5 million

, in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  The decrease in operating income was largely due to startup costs from businesses in the early stage of operations in this segment, partially offset by increased earnings from our specialty produce and custom-cut meat segments.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business; these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets.  Our operations historically have produced significant cash flow.  Cash generated from operations is generally allocated to:

•

working capital requirements;

•

investments in facilities, systems, fleet, other equipment and technology;

•

return of capital to shareholders, including cash dividends and share repurchases;


•

acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy;

•

contributions to our various retirement plans; and

•

debt repayments.

Any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high-quality, short-term instruments. As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses, and our overall capital structure. Any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage ratios and capital availability.

We continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position; however, our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations. We believe our mechanisms to manage working capital, such as credit monitoring, optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors, and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. We believe these mechanisms will continue to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. Seasonal trends also impact our cash flows from operations and free cash flow, as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger, sequential quarterly increases throughout the remainder of the year. As of

July 2, 2016

, we had $

3.9 billion

in cash and cash equivalents, approximately

12.0%

of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations.  This percentage is lower because the proceeds from our offerings of senior notes, which we issued to fund the Brakes Acquisition, were held in cash at

July 2, 2016

as the acquisition did not close until fiscal


.  With this cash expended in fiscal


, we would expect this percentage to return to historical levels, such as 32%, which was the percentage as of

June 28, 2014

.  If these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations; however, we do not currently anticipate the need to repatriate this cash.

We believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes:

•

our cash flows from operations;

•

the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs, supported by our revolving credit facility and bank line of credit; and

•

our ability to access capital from financial markets, including issuances of debt securities, either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Due to our strong financial position, we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and long-term capital markets, if necessary.

Cash Flows

Operating Activities

Fiscal


vs. Fiscal


We generated

$1.9 billion

in cash flows from operations in fiscal


compared to cash flow generation of

$1.6 billion

in fiscal


. This increase of

$377.7 million

year-over-year was largely attributable to tax payments deferred to future periods and improved working capital management, partially offset by an unfavorable comparison on accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The cash impact of our Certain Items increased $

48.9

million year-over-year.  The cash impact of Certain Items will differ from the earnings impact of Certain Items, as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from the period in which the Certain Item charges were recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Results of Operations.  The extra week in fiscal


also contributed to the increase in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.

Our tax payments in fiscal


were lower than in fiscal


due to changes in tax elections allowing us to accelerate tax deductions from method changes which, in turn, significantly reduced our estimated payments in fiscal


by delaying the timing of these payments to future periods.  Additionally, Sysco's fourth quarter U.S. estimated federal tax payment was deferred to the second quarter of fiscal


due to a disaster area designation for companies located in the Houston area, the location of


our corporate headquarters.  We estimate our cash tax payments to range from $700 to $850 million in fiscal


, including an approximate $120 million for the deferred tax payment from the fourth quarter of fiscal


.

The negative comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to

$312.5 million

in US Foods merger termination payments and a

$47.1 million

decrease from incentive payments.  Our annual incentive payments, for performance in the prior fiscal year, are paid in the first quarter of each succeeding fiscal year.  Incentive payments paid in fiscal 2015 were lower than amounts paid in fiscal


due to lower payouts achieved from fiscal


performance.  Also contributing to the negative comparison was lower payroll accruals due to timing and reduced accrued interest due to differing debt levels and interest payment dates.

Included in the change in other long-term liabilities was a negative comparison primarily from pension contributions of

$153.4 million

.  Pension contributions were

$157.4 million

in fiscal


, including a

$130 million

contribution to our Retirement Plan in fiscal


, which resulted in a decrease to other long-term liabilities. Of this

$130 million

amount, $100 million represented funding that the company would have made in fiscal


, but chose to fund in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.  Pension Contributions were

$75.1 million

in fiscal


, including a $50 million contribution to our Retirement Plan in fiscal


, which resulted in a decrease to other long-term liabilities. The level and timing of the contribution to our Retirement Plan in fiscal


is still being determined.

Changes in working capital, specifically accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, had a positive impact of

$127.9 million

on the period over period comparison of cash flow from operations primarily from improvements in inventory management.  Sales growth impacted all components of working capital; however, deflation contributed to lower levels of increase in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.  Additionally, favorable turnover drove positive comparisons on inventories.

Fiscal


vs. Fiscal


We generated

$1.6 billion

in cash flow from operations in fiscal


, as compared to

$1.5 billion

in fiscal


.  This increase of

$62.7 million

, or

4.2%

, was largely attributable to favorable comparisons on accrued expenses, partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on the cash impact of our Certain Items that increased $148.9 million year-over-year.  Other unfavorable comparisons were a decrease in other long-term liabilities and the impact of timing for pension contributions, as well as increased working capital needs.

Included in the change in accrued expenses was a

favorable

comparison of incentive accruals due to better performance against incentive targets in fiscal


.  Our Certain Items increased primarily from integration planning, litigation and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods.  Our merger termination fees of

$312.5 million

, payable to US Foods and Performance Food Group, were accrued as of

June 27, 2015

and were paid in July


.

Included in the change in other long-term liabilities was a negative comparison on pension expense and contributions, which contributed

$90.4 million

to the

unfavorable

comparison on cash flow from operations for fiscal


to fiscal


.  Pension income was

$15.3 million

and pension contributions were

$75.1 million

, including a

$50

contribution to our Retirement Plan in fiscal


, which resulted in a decrease to other long-term liabilities.  Pension expense was

$4.8 million

and pension contributions were

$24.8 million

in fiscal


, which resulted in a decrease to other long-term liabilities.

Changes in working capital, specifically accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, had a net

unfavorable

comparison of

$25 million

on the comparison of cash flow from operations for fiscal


to fiscal


.  There was a favorable comparison on inventory and accounts receivable, which was partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on accounts payable.  Accounts receivable increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales; however, the level of increase in fiscal


was less than fiscal


due to improved collection efforts.  Inventory increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales.  However, inventory turnover improved in fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


.  Accounts payable increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales.  The year-over-year impact of the change in accounts payable is unfavorable to cash flow from operations due to working capital improvements that were at a greater magnitude in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.

Investing Activities

Fiscal


capital expenditures included:

•

fleet replacements;

•

investments in technology;

•

replacement or significant expansion of facilities in California, Maryland, Texas, and Virginia; and

•

construction of fold-out facilities in Ireland and Texas.


Fiscal


capital expenditures included:

•

fleet replacements;

•

investments in technology;

•

replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Arizona, California, Iowa and Virginia; and

•

construction of fold-out facilities in Ireland.

Fiscal


capital expenditures included:

•

fleet replacements;

•

construction of fold-out facilities in Ontario, Canada and Ireland;

•

replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Arizona, California, Pennsylvania and Virginia; and

•

investments in technology.

The level of capital expenditures in fiscal


was mostly consistent with fiscal


, representing a small decrease of $

15.5 million

. Capital expenditures in fiscal


increased by $

19.6 million

.

We estimate our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, in fiscal


to be approximately

1%

of fiscal sales. This estimate includes the impact of the Brakes Acquisition.  Fiscal


expenditures will include facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; new facility construction, including fold-out facilities; and investments in technology.

During fiscal


, the company paid cash of $

219.2 million

for acquisitions including a leading luxury personal care amenity provider in the hospitality industry, a distributor of high-quality fresh and frozen seafood based in Florida and an innovative e-commerce platform providing restaurant supplies and equipment exclusively to Sysco customers.

During fiscal


, we eliminated our restricted cash balance of

$168.3 million

by using letters of credit as security for self-insurance instead of restricted cash.

During fiscal


, we paid

$103.5 million

and received

$57.5 million

for options to hedge against the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the purchase price of the Brakes Acquisition.

During fiscal


, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of

$115.9 million

for operations acquired during fiscal


and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years.  During fiscal


, we acquired for cash a Broadline company in Ontario, Canada; a joint venture interest in a foodservice distribution company in Mexico; a joint venture interest in a foodservice distribution company in Costa Rica and a specialty seafood company in New Jersey.

During fiscal


, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of

$79.3 million

for operations acquired during fiscal


and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years.  During fiscal


, we acquired for cash a specialty meat company in Maryland and Broadline operations in Missouri, Ohio and Philadelphia.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment.  Sysco considers free cash flow to be a non-GAAP liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions.  However, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments.  As a result of increased cash provided by operating activities, decreased capital spending and decreased proceeds from sale of plant and equipment, free cash flow for fiscal


increased

37.8%

, or

$392.2 million

, to

$1.4 billion

, as compared to fiscal


.   Our cash requirements for our Certain Items were

$48.9

million greater in fiscal


than in fiscal


and reduced free cash flow as a result; however, our cash flow from operations increased despite these Certain Items as discussed above. Fewer additions to plant and equipment also contributed to the increase. As a result of increased cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by increased capital spending and decreased proceeds from sales of plant and equipment, free cash flow for fiscal


increased 4.2%, or $41.7 million, to $1.0 billion as compared to fiscal


.

Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented.  An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results


presented in accordance with GAAP.  In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities.

Financing Activities

Equity Transactions

Proceeds from exercises of share-based compensation awards were $

282.5 million

in fiscal


, $

240.2 million

in fiscal


and

$255.6 million

in fiscal


.  The increase in proceeds in fiscal


was due to an increase in the number of options exercised in this period, as compared to fiscal


.  The level of option exercises, and thus proceeds, will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire.

We routinely engage in share repurchase programs.  The number of shares acquired and their cost during fiscal


were

44,716,180

shares for

$1.9 billion

, with 10,059,000 shares for $332.4 million repurchased in fiscal


. No shares were acquired in fiscal 2015 due to the proposed US Foods merger. In June 2015, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase, from time to time in the open market, through an accelerated share repurchase program or through privately negotiated transactions, shares of the company's common stock in an amount not to exceed

$3.0 billion

during the two-year period ending

July 1, 2017

, in addition to amounts normally repurchased to offset benefit plan and stock option dilution. We executed

$1.5 billion

of this authorization through an accelerated share repurchase program that commenced in the first quarter of fiscal


. As a result, there were

34,716,180

shares repurchased during fiscal


, resulting in a remaining authorization by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to approximately

$1.5 billion

in additional shares under the accelerated share repurchase authorization, which we expect to repurchase in fiscal 2017. Our historical approach to share repurchases was to buy enough shares to keep our average shares outstanding relatively constant over time.  In addition to the share repurchase program approved in June, in August 2015, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to

20,000,000

shares for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed

$800 million

. The authorization expires on August 21, 2017.   We purchased

10,000,000

shares under this authorization through

July 2, 2016

.  We purchased

5,607,003

additional shares under this authorization through August 12, 2016. The number of shares we repurchase during the remainder of fiscal


will be dependent on many factors, including the level of future stock option exercises, as well as competing uses for available cash.

We have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company's inception over 40 years ago. We target a dividend payout of 40% to 50% of net earnings. We paid in excess of that range in fiscal 2016 and fiscal


primarily due to increased expenses from our Certain Items. Dividends paid were

$698.9 million

, or

$1.23

per share, in fiscal


, $

695.3 million

, or $

1.17

per share, in fiscal


, and $667.2 million, or $1.14 per share, in fiscal 2014.  In May 2016, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal


of

$0.31

per share, which was paid in July


.

In November 2000, we filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of

August 12, 2016

29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement.


Debt Activity and Borrowing Availability

Our debt activity, including issuances and repayments, and our borrowing availability is described in

Note 11

,

"Debt and Other Financing Arrangements"

Our outstanding borrowings at

July 2, 2016

, and repayment activity since the close of fiscal


are disclosed within those notes.  Updated amounts through

August 12, 2016

, include:

•

$342.8 million

outstanding from our commercial paper program

•

No amounts outstanding from the credit facility supporting the company’s U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs.

Our aggregate commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of

0.49%

for fiscal


,

0.54%

for fiscal


, and

0.16%

for fiscal


.

Other Considerations

Multiemployer Plans

Our exposure to multiemployer defined benefit plans is discussed in

Note 15

"Multiemployer Employee Benefit Plans"

including our estimate of our share of withdrawal liability for these plans. An update of this amount through

August 12, 2016

, based on the latest available information, is unchanged from the amount disclosed in Note 15.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual Obligations

The following table sets forth, as of

July 2, 2016

, certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments:

(1)

The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and Management Savings Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods.


(2)

The estimated contributions through fiscal 2026 to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements based on actuarial assumptions include the extension of funding relief included in the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

(3)

Includes estimated contributions to the unfunded SERP and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal 2026, based on actuarial assumptions.

(4)

Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions.  As of

July 2, 2016

, we had a liability of

$24.6 million

for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and

$14.9 million

for related interest that could result in cash payment.  We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time.  Accordingly, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table.

(5)

Includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of

July 2, 2016

, assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates. The impact of our outstanding fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of

July 2, 2016

.

(6)

For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, including minimum quantities resulting from our category management initiative.  As we progress with this initiative, our purchase obligations are increasing.  Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates.  Purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various third-party service providers to provide information technology services for periods up to fiscal 2020 (see discussion under

Note 21

,

"Commitments and Contingencies"

, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8) and fixed fuel purchase commitments. Purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required.

Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of

July 2, 2016

were

$30.9 million

. This amount is not included in the table above.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by Sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements.

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the company-sponsored pension plans, income taxes, goodwill and intangible assets and share-based compensation.

Company-Sponsored Pension Plans

Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Our Retirement Plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees. Our SERP is frozen and is not open to any employees. Due to the low level of active employees in the Retirement Plan, our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is not a critical assumption.

For guidance in determining the discount rates, we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate for determining fiscal


net pension costs for the Retirement Plan increased


basis points to

4.84%

as of the

June 27, 2015

measurement date. The discount rate for determining fiscal


net pension costs for the SERP increased


basis points to

4.63%

as of the

June 27, 2015

measurement date. The combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal


by an estimated

$1 million

. The discount rate for determining fiscal


net pension costs for the Retirement Plan decreased


basis points to

4.07%

as of the

July 2, 2016

measurement date. The discount rate for determining fiscal


net pension costs for the SERP decreased


basis points to

3.91%

as of the

July 2, 2016

measurement date. The combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal


by an estimated

$8

million. A 100 basis point increase (or decrease) in the discount rates for fiscal


would decrease (or increase) Sysco’s net company-sponsored pension cost by approximately

$11 million

. Sysco’s pension plans are primarily


frozen, therefore, the net company-sponsored pension cost is not as sensitive to discount rate changes as compared to an active plan.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was

7.25%

and

7.75%

for fiscal


and fiscal


, respectively. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately

6.9%

,

5.5%

,

7%

, and

1.7%

, over the 20-year, 10-year, 5-year and 1-year periods ended

December 31, 2015

, respectively. In addition, in

seven

of the last


years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded

10%

. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.

The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan is

7.25%

for fiscal


. A 100 basis point increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal


would decrease (increase) Sysco’s net company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal


by approximately

$31 million

.

Pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of

July 2, 2016

was a charge, net of tax, of

$1.1 billion

. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of

June 27, 2015

was a charge, net of tax, of

$705.3 million

.

We made cash contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans of $

157.5 million

and

$75.1 million

in fiscal years


and


, respectively.  Our contributions in fiscal


include a

$130 million

contribution to the Retirement Plan that was voluntary, as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar


plan year to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements. There are no required contributions to the Retirement Plan to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal


. The estimated fiscal


contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP plan are approximately

$30 million

.

Income Taxes

The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit.

In addition, annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets. The reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our


operating segments as described in

Note 22

,

"Business Segment Information"

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The components within each of our


operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into


reporting units.

We arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our


operating segments. We primarily use a

60%

weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and

40%

for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant. The


primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums, earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by Sysco in the past, future cash flow estimates of the reporting units, which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates, and weighted average cost of capital, along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements. When possible, we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units. We update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.

Our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. There were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal


,


, and


. Our past estimates of fair value for fiscal


and


would not have been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results. Sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units. In the fiscal


assessment, our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis. However, we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for our European and Mexican Broadline reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by

5%

and

7%

, respectively, with goodwill of

$195.9 million

in aggregate as of

July 2, 2016

. For the remaining goodwill of

$1.9 billion

, we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value of these reporting units had declined by greater than

23%

.

Certain reporting units (European Broadline, Caribbean Broadline, Mexican Broadline, specialty produce, custom-cut meat, lodging industry products, imported specialty products, international distribution operations and our Sysco Ventures platform) have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the U.S. Broadline, Canada Broadline or SYGMA reporting units. This is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired, and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the U.S. Broadline, Canadian Broadline and SYGMA reporting units. In addition, these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the U.S. Broadline reporting unit. As such, these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn.

Share-Based Compensation

Sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under several share-based payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans, a non-employee director plan and the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan.

As of

July 2, 2016

, there was

$69.6 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.4 years

.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of Sysco’s stock, implied volatilities from traded options on Sysco’s stock and other factors. We utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. For restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.

The fair value of the stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price.

The fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or non-employee directors is based on the stock price on grant date.  The application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post-vesting restriction.

The compensation cost related to these share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made.

Our share-based awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period. We will recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.


In addition, certain of our share-based awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement. In these cases, we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement.

Our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes. In the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options. We may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option. In such cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates.  Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” which are incorporated herein by reference.

In addition to the Risk Factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, the success of Sysco’s three year strategic financial objectives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors, such as the ability to control expenses, including fuel costs.  Our expectations for the Brakes Acquisition could be impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in Europe.  Our expectations regarding case growth and cost per case may be impacted by factors beyond our control, including actions by our competitors and/or customers.  Our expectations for deflation could be impacted by market events and supplier costs.  Company-sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets.  The amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors, including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time.  Meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings, available cash and the success of our various strategic initiatives.  Our expectations regarding earnings per share and various items impacting earnings is subject to a number of factors, including our ability to manage operating expenses and the impact of Certain Items.  Our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to our other strategic initiatives, the allocation of resources, and plans and economic conditions generally.  Legal proceedings and the adequacy of insurance are impacted by events, circumstances and individuals beyond the control of Sysco.  Expectations of cash tax payments can be impacted by our performance.  The need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by various factors, including capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated, levels of stock repurchases, or other unexpected cash requirements.  Plans regarding the repayment of debt are subject to change at any time based on management’s assessment of the overall needs of the company.  Capital expenditures may vary from those projected based on changes in business plans and other factors, including risks related to the timing and successful completions of acquisitions, construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending.  Our ability to finance capital expenditures as anticipated may be influenced by our results of operations, our borrowing capacity, share repurchases, dividend levels and other factors.  Expectations regarding tax rates and the transfer of cash held in foreign jurisdictions are subject to various factors beyond our control and decisions of management throughout the fiscal year that are subject to change based on Sysco's business needs.  The anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect, and laws and regulations, as well as methods of enforcement, are subject to change.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our market risks consist of interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, fuel price risk and investment risk.

Interest Rate Risk

We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes.  Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk.  Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates.  Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates.


We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position.  The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions.

At

July 2, 2016

, there were

no

commercial paper issuances outstanding. Total debt as of

July 2, 2016

was

$7.4 billion

, of which approximately

68%

was at fixed rates of interest, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements.

As of

June 27, 2015

, we had no commercial paper outstanding.  Total debt as of

June 27, 2015

was

$7.3 billion

, of which approximately

74%

was at fixed rates of interest, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement.  Included in the total debt amount is

$5.0 billion

in senior notes that were issued in October


, for the proposed merger with US Foods.  The October 2014 senior notes contained mandatory redemption features providing that, on the earlier of the merger agreement termination date or October 8,


, we were required to redeem all of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to

101%

of the principal of the senior notes plus accrued interest.  In June


, we terminated the merger agreement and redeemed the senior notes in July


using cash on hand and the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper facility.

Details of our outstanding swap agreements as of

Includes fixed rate debt that has been converted to floating rate debt through an interest rate swap agreement.

Rate A – six-month LIBOR

Rate B - three month LIBOR

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency.  To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk.  We will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.  Our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars.  The exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars

negatively

impacted sales by

1.3%

in fiscal


when compared to fiscal


.  The exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars

negatively

impacted sales by

1%

in fiscal


when compared to fiscal


.  The impact to our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal


or fiscal


.  A

10%

unfavorable change in the fiscal


weighted year-to-date exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal


sales by

4%

and would not have materially impacted our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share.  We do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks.

The Brakes Acquisition required payment in pounds sterling, euro and Swedish kroner.  The company developed a strategy to hedge the currency exposure related to these cash outlays.  A portion of this strategy included foreign currency option contracts to protect Sysco from an increase in the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling.  This helped provide downside protection during the time frame the transaction was being reviewed for anti-trust approval and thereafter during the


volatility around the referendum on June 23, 2016 in the United Kingdom to exit the European Union (the U.K. Referendum).  Such contracts were considered economic hedges and did not qualify for hedge accounting.  In fiscal 2016, the total realized net loss on our economic hedge foreign exchange option contracts was

$45.7 million

.  These contracts were terminated at or near the company's fiscal year end and did not have a material fair value as of July 2, 2016.  A second part of our strategy was to accumulate the currency needed for the acquisition once anti-trust approval was received.  This accumulation occurred over a period of time prior to, as well as after, the U.K. Referendum.  During this period, the currency rates experienced large fluctuations, particularly with regard to the pound sterling.  Our approach allowed us to accumulate this cash at an average rate that was better than our target exchange rate established at the time the transaction was announced.  We were required to remeasure this foreign denominated cash into U.S. dollars at the conclusion of the fiscal year and incurred a remeasurement loss of

$101.2 million

.  Both of these related to our purchase price for the acquisition of the Brakes Group, which closed shortly after our fiscal year end.  With this cash now expended, we no longer have a significant amount of foreign cash that would require remeasurement.

Our Brakes Acquisition will create additional foreign currency exposure.  Subsequent to fiscal


, we designated

€500 million

of Euro notes issued in June 2016 and various intercompany notes as hedges of a portion of our net investment in Euro-denominated and Sterling-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of these debt items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates to U.S. Dollar exchange rates will be recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).   Subsequent to fiscal


, we entered into various cross currency swaps to mitigate the risk of exchange rate changes when an intercompany loan is not in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries.  These have been designated as cash flow hedges with changes to be recorded within foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Additional cross currency swaps were entered into to create additional net investment hedges.

Fuel Price Risk

Due to the nature of our distribution business, we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices. The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production, seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas.  First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases.  Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers.  Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers.  During fiscal


and fiscal


, fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately

0.5%

and

0.6%

of sales, respectively.

Our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven, improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges.  We routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. As of

July 2, 2016

, we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately

$84.9 million

through May 2017. These contracts will lock in the price of approximately

45%

of our fuel purchase needs for fiscal


. Our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date.  Using current, published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption, a

10%

unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately

$13.8 million

in our fuel costs on our non-contracted volumes.

Investment Risk

Our company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan) holds investments in public and private equity, fixed income securities and real estate funds.  The amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon, among other things, the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability.  Fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal year-end, which is when this plan’s funded status is measured.  Also, the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets.  To the extent the financial markets experience declines, our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years.  A

10%

unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company-sponsored Retirement Plan at the plan’s fiscal year end (December 31, 2015) would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal


; however, this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal


by

$32.1 million

and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of

July 2, 2016

by

$311.5 million

.

All schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the information is set forth in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.


REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company.  Sysco’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Sysco’s management assessed the effectiveness of Sysco’s internal control over financial reporting as of

July 2, 2016

.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013).

Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of

July 2, 2016

, Sysco’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of Sysco’s internal control over financial reporting as of

July 2, 2016

.


REPORT

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sysco Corporation

We have audited Sysco Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of

July 2, 2016

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).  Sysco Corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Sysco Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

July 2, 2016

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

July 2, 2016

and

June 27, 2015

, and the related consolidated results of operations, and statements of comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended

July 2, 2016

of Sysco Corporation and subsidiaries and our report dated

August 29, 2016

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business and Consolidation

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions (Sysco or the company), is engaged in the marketing and distribution of a wide range of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. These services are performed for approximately

425,000

customers from


distribution facilities located throughout the United States (U.S.), Bahamas, Canada and Ireland.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30

th

. This resulted in a 53-week year ending

July 2, 2016

for fiscal


, and 52-week years for the years ended

June 27, 2015

for fiscal


and

June 28, 2014

for fiscal


.

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Sysco and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses. Actual results could differ from the estimates used.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash includes cash equivalents such as time deposits, certificates of deposit, short-term investments and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less, which are recorded at fair value.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from customers and receivables from suppliers for marketing or incentive programs. Sysco determines the past due status of trade receivables based on contractual terms with each customer. Sysco evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or been placed in bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods. In these instances, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on an analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries.

Inventories

Inventories consisting primarily of finished goods include food and related products and lodging products held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.  Elements of costs include the purchase price of the product and freight charges to deliver the product to the company’s warehouses and are net of certain cash or non-cash consideration received from vendors (see “Vendor Consideration”).

Plant and Equipment

Capital additions, improvements and major replacements are classified as plant and equipment and are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which reduces the book value of each asset in equal amounts over its estimated useful life, and is included within operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to earnings when they are incurred. Upon the disposition of an asset, its accumulated depreciation is deducted from the original cost, and any gain or loss is reflected in current earnings.

Certain internal and external costs related to the acquisition and development of internal use software are capitalized within plant and equipment during the application development stages of the project.

Applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of new facilities and development of software for internal use are capitalized as one of the elements of cost and are amortized over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Interest capitalized for the past three fiscal years was

$2.0 million

in fiscal


,

$0.9 million

in fiscal


and

$1.1 million

in fiscal


.


Long-Lived Assets

Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset’s useful life based on updated projections on an undiscounted basis.  For assets held for use, Sysco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured using fair value.  Impairment losses for assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Intangibles

Goodwill and intangibles represent the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of a business combination. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is assessed annually, or more frequently as needed when events or changes have occurred that would suggest an impairment of carrying value, by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. The reporting units used to assess goodwill impairment are the company’s


operating segments as described in

Note 22

, “Business Segment Information.” The components within each of the


operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into


reporting units. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions.

Intangibles with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives in a manner consistent with underlying cash flow, which generally ranges from

two

to

ten years

. Management reviews finite-lived intangibles for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the finite-lived intangibles are estimated over the intangible asset’s useful life based on updated projections on an undiscounted basis. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured at fair value.

Restricted Cash

Sysco is required by its insurers to collateralize a part of the self-insured portion of its workers’ compensation and liability claims. Sysco has chosen to satisfy these collateral requirements by depositing funds in insurance trusts or by issuing letters of credit.  Sysco chose to satisfy these collateral requirements by issuing letters of credit in fiscal


.  All amounts in restricted cash at

June 27, 2015

represented funds deposited in insurance trusts.

Derivative Financial Instruments

All derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets at fair value at their gross values.  Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are recognized immediately in the consolidated results of operations, along with the offsetting gain or loss related to the underlying hedged item.

Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity from inception of the hedges to their settlement, at which time gains or losses are reclassified to the Consolidated Results of Operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying hedged item.

In the normal course of business, Sysco enters into forward purchase agreements for the procurement of fuel and electricity.  Certain of these agreements meet the definition of a derivative.  However, the company elected to use the normal purchase and sale exemption available under derivatives accounting literature; therefore, these agreements are not recorded at fair value.

Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance

Investments in corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies are recorded at their cash surrender values as of each balance sheet date. Changes in the cash surrender value during the period are recorded as a gain or loss within operating expenses.  Sysco has the ability and intent to hold its COLI policies to maturity and the company does not record deferred tax balances related to cash surrender value gains or losses for these policies.  Deferred tax balances are recorded for those policies that Sysco intends to redeem prior to maturity. The total amounts related to the company’s investments in COLI policies included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets were

$163.3 million

and

$162.8 million

at

July 2, 2016

and

June 27, 2015

, respectively.


Treasury Stock

The company records treasury stock purchases at cost.  Shares removed from treasury are valued at cost using the average cost method.

Foreign Currency Translation

The assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Revenue Recognition

The company recognizes revenue from the sale of a product when it is considered to be realized or realizable and earned. The company determines these requirements to be met at the point at which the product is delivered to the customer. The company grants certain customers sales incentives such as rebates or discounts and treats these as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Sales tax collected from customers is not included in revenue but rather recorded as a liability due to the respective taxing authorities. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are considered to be a single nonmonetary transaction. As such, the company records the net effect of such transactions in the consolidated results of operations within sales.

Vendor Consideration

Sysco recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by Sysco as a reduction to cost of sales. There are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, Sysco will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In the situations in which the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases, Sysco will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service is performed and the amounts are realized.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs include costs associated with the selection of products and delivery to customers. Included in operating expenses are shipping and handling costs of approximately

$2.6 billion

in fiscal


, fiscal


and fiscal


.

Insurance Program

Sysco maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability and property insurance costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. The company also maintains a fully self-insured group medical program. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.

Share-Based Compensation

Sysco recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option pricing methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on the company’s stock price on the date of grant. Measured compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. Cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) are classified as financing cash flows on the consolidated cash flows statements.

Income Taxes

Sysco recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.

Sysco recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of


the position. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, estimated amounts required by the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions have been accrued and are classified as a component of income taxes in the consolidated results of operations.

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The company’s provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as various foreign jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

Acquisitions

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the financial statements include the results of the acquired operations from the respective dates of acquisition.

The purchase price of the acquired entities is allocated to the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition, with any excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangibles, recognized as goodwill. The balances included in the consolidated balance sheets related to recent acquisitions are based upon preliminary information and are subject to change when final asset and liability valuations are obtained. Subsequent changes to the preliminary balances are reflected retrospectively, if material. Material changes to the preliminary allocations are not anticipated by management.

Basis of Presentation

The financial statements include consolidated balance sheets, consolidated results of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated cash flows. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise disclosed, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for all periods presented have been made.

Deferred taxes within the consolidated balance sheet for

July 2, 2016

, have been classified as long-term due to the adoption of an accounting pronouncement related to simplification in the presentation of deferred taxes. See

Note 2

,

"Changes in Accounting"

for additional information on these changes.

In fiscal 2015, Sysco acquired a

50%

interest in a foodservice company in Mexico and accounted for this interest using the equity-method of accounting. In fiscal 2016, Sysco obtained control of the board of this company and began consolidating these operations; therefore, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for this company have been included in Sysco’s consolidated financial statements. The value of the

50%

noncontrolling interest is considered redeemable due to certain features of the investment agreement and has been presented as mezzanine equity, which is outside of permanent equity, in the consolidated balance sheets. The income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is located within Other expense (income), net, in the consolidated results of operations, as this amount is not material. The non-cash add back for the change in the value of the noncontrolling interest is located within Other non-cash items on the consolidated cash flows.

In fiscal 2015, Sysco acquired a

50%

interest in a foodservice company in Costa Rica. It was determined that consolidation of the entity was appropriate and, therefore, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for this company have been included in Sysco’s consolidated financial statements. The value of the

50%

noncontrolling interest is considered redeemable due to certain features of the investment agreement and has been presented as mezzanine equity, which is outside of permanent equity, in the consolidated balance sheets. The income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is located within Other expense (income), net in the consolidated results of operations, as this amount is not material. The non-cash add back for the change in the value of the noncontrolling interest is located within Other non-cash items on the consolidated cash flows.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING

Simplification of Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17,

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,

as part of its simplification initiative, which is the FASB's effort to reduce the cost and complexity of certain aspects of U.S. GAAP. This guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities within a jurisdiction. The company early adopted this standard in the second quarter of fiscal


on a prospective basis, as permitted by the ASU.


3.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Stock Compensation

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. In addition, the amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which is fiscal 2018 for Sysco, with early adoption permitted. The company is currently reviewing the provisions of the new standard.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842)

, specifying the accounting for leases, which supersedes the leases requirements in Topic 840,

Leases

. The objective of Topic 842 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessors’ accounting is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard. In addition, Topic 842 expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. Lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, which is fiscal 2020 for Sysco, with early adoption permitted. The company is currently reviewing the provisions of the new standard.

Financial Instruments

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,

Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10),

which requires the following: (1) all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee); (2) an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; and (3) eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities and the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which is fiscal 2019 for Sysco. The company is currently reviewing the provisions of the new standard.

Business Combinations

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,

Business Combinations (Topic 805)

, which requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition, an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, which is fiscal 2017 for Sysco. The amendment will be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier adoption permitted.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

. This new standard will replace all current GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific

guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.

The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers

in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)

, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The collective guidance is effective


for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which is fiscal 2019 for Sysco, and could be early adopted in fiscal 2018. The standard may be applied either

retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The company has not selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of this ASU on its ongoing financial reporting.

4.

ACQUISITIONS

During fiscal


, the company paid cash of

$219.2 million

for acquisitions. The acquisitions did not have a material effect on operating results, cash flows or financial position. Certain current year and prior year acquisitions involve contingent consideration that include earnout agreements that are payable over periods of up to

three years

in the event that certain operating results are achieved. Remaining amounts relate to payments that are deferred for a certain period time to ensure pre-acquisition claims do not arise.  As of

July 2, 2016

, aggregate contingent consideration outstanding was

$30.9 million

, of which

$16.4 million

was recorded as earnout liabilities included in accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities, depending on when such earnout payments become due.

In February 2016, Sysco entered into a share sale and purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) to acquire Cucina Lux Investments Limited, the parent holding company of the Brakes Group (the Brakes Acquisition). On July 5, 2016, following the end of fiscal year 2016, Sysco closed the Brakes Acquisition. The aggregate enterprise value paid by Sysco in connection with the Brakes Acquisition was approximately

£2.3 billion

(approximately

$3.1 billion

based on exchange rates on July 5, 2016), and included the repayment of approximately

$2.3 billion

of the Brakes Group's then outstanding debt.  The purchase price was paid primarily in cash using the proceeds from recent debt issuances and other cash on hand, and is subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The Brakes Group is now wholly owned by Sysco. The Brakes Group is a leading European foodservice business with operations in the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Ireland, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg.

5.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). The accounting guidance includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;

•

Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

•

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which include management’s own assumption about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.

Sysco’s policy is to invest in only high-quality investments. Cash equivalents primarily include time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, high-quality money market funds and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash consists of investments in high-quality money market funds.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value:

•

Time deposits and commercial paper included in cash equivalents are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.  These are included within cash equivalents as a Level 2 measurement in the tables below.

•

Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor from an actively traded exchange.  These are included within cash equivalents and restricted cash as Level 1 measurements in the tables below.

•

The interest rate swap agreements, discussed further in

Note 9

,

"Derivative Financial Instruments"

are valued using a swap valuation model that utilizes an income approach using observable market inputs including interest rates, LIBOR swap rates and credit default swap rates.  These are included within other assets and other long-term liabilities as Level 2 measurements in the tables below.

•

Contingent consideration in the form of earnout agreements relating to acquisitions is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow approach using various probability-weighted scenarios. The significant unobservable inputs used in calculating the fair value of the contingent consideration includes financial performance scenarios, the probability of achieving those scenarios and the discount rate. These are included in contingent consideration liabilities as Level 3 measurements in the table below. For additional information, see

Note 4

,

"Acquisitions"

.


The following tables present the company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

July 2, 2016

and

June 27, 2015

:

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of our Level 3 contingent consideration liabilities related to earnout agreements were as follows:

A decrease in probabilities of achieving the targets or an increase in the discount rates would result in a lower fair value measurement.  The fair value of contingent consideration for earnout agreements is reassessed quarterly, including an analysis of the significant inputs used the valuation, as well as the accretion of the present value discount.  Changes are reflected within Operating expense in the consolidated results of operations.

The following table provides the changes in fair value of the contingent consideration for earnout liabilities for the periods presented (in thousands):


The carrying values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term maturities. The fair value of Sysco’s total debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issue or on the current rates offered to the company for debt of the same remaining maturities and is considered a Level 2 measurement. The fair value of total debt was approximately

$7.9 billion

and

$7.6 billion

as of

July 2, 2016

and

June 27, 2015

, respectively. The carrying value of total debt was

$7.4 billion

and

$7.3 billion

as of

July 2, 2016

and

In fiscal


, Sysco announced its revised business technology strategy focused on improving the customer experience. In refocusing its technology approach, Sysco created plans to modernize and add new capability and functionality to its existing SUS Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. In connection with this strategy, Sysco created plans to remove the SAP ERP platform currently used by


of its operating companies by the end of fiscal


. At the time of the decision, the company had $

31.6 million

re


corded as construction in progress for incomplete projects for the SAP ERP platform and $

251.1 million

in net book value for internal use software for the SAP ERP platform, with a remaining life of

three years

. These are included within "computer hardware and software" in the table above. Sysco concluded that the projects under development would not be completed and expensed the $

31.6 million

in construction in progress in fiscal


within operating expense in the consolidated results of operations. The company tested the internal use software currently amortizing for the SAP ERP platform on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that those cash flows would be sufficient to recover the full asset value for the remaining period the asset is planned to be in use. Sysco shortened the remaining life of the internal use assets to be fully amortized by the end of fiscal 2017, concurrent with the expected time frame to be fully migrated into Sysco's


operating companies to the SUS ERP system. In fiscal


, Sysco recognized an additional $

41.9 million

in amortization expense as a result of shortening the useful lives of these assets.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Sysco manages its debt portfolio with interest rate swaps from time to time to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates. The proposed Brakes Acquisition requires payment for the purchase price in pound sterling. Sysco chose to economically hedge this foreign currency exposure. The company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Hedging of debt portfolio

In April 2016, Sysco issued senior notes totaling $

2.5 billion

in aggregate principal amount. Sysco used the net proceeds from the offering to fund the Brakes Acquisition. Concurrent with the offering of senior notes described above, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted

$1.0 billion

of senior notes maturing in fiscal 2019 and 2021 to floating rate debt. These transactions were designated as fair value hedges against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates.

In October 2015, Sysco issued senior notes totaling

$2.0 billion

to fund

$1.5 billion

in repurchases of outstanding shares of its common stock pursuant to its

$1.5 billion

accelerated share repurchase program, to repay approximately

$500 million

of its outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Concurrent with the offering of these senior notes, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted

$750 million

of senior notes maturing in fiscal 2020 to floating rate debt. These transactions were designated as fair value hedges against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates.

In August 2015, the company entered into forward starting swap agreements with a notional amount totaling

$500 million

. The company designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges to reduce interest rate exposure on the forecasted


-year debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rates on debt the company issued in October 2015. Concurrent with this debt offering, Sysco terminated the swaps and paid

$6.1 million

. The loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the originally hedged fixed-rate interest rate payments.

In October 2014, Sysco obtained long-term financing for its proposed merger with US Foods, Inc. (US Foods) by completing a six-part senior notes offering totaling

$5.0 billion

. At the same time of this offering of notes, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted

$500 million

of senior notes maturing in fiscal 2018 and

$750 million

of senior notes maturing in fiscal 2020 to floating rate debt. These are collectively referred to as the 2015 swaps. These transactions were designated as fair value hedges against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates. In fiscal 2016, the company terminated the 2015 swaps for proceeds of

$14.5 million

in connection with the redemption of these senior notes.

In January 2014, the company entered into

two

forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling

$2 billion

in contemplation of securing long-term financing for the proposed US Foods merger or for other long-term financing purposes in the event the merger did not occur. The company designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges to reduce interest rate exposure on forecasted


-year and


-year debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rates until the expected issuance of the debt. In September 2014, in conjunction with the pricing of the

$1.25 billion

senior notes maturing in fiscal 2025 and the

$1 billion

senior notes maturing in fiscal 2045, the company terminated these swaps, locking in the effective yields on the related debt. Cash of

$58.9 million

was paid to settle the


-year swap in September 2014, and cash of

$129.9 million

was paid to settle the


-year swap in October 2014. The cash payments are located within the line Cash paid for settlement of cash flow hedge within financing activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows. The cumulative losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to these swaps will continue to be amortized through interest expense over the term of the originally hedged fixed-rate interest rate payments, as those payments are anticipated to remain within Sysco's capital structure.  The interest payments included in Sysco's originally hedged amount were


semiannual interest cash flows on

$1.0 billion

in a


ggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt and


semiannual interest cash flows on

$1.0 billion

in aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt. Amortization commenced in October 2014 when those interest payments began affecting earnings.

In August 2013, the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted

$500 million

of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2018 to floating rate debt.

Hedging of foreign currency exposure

The Brakes Acquisition required payment in pounds sterling, euro and Swedish kroner.  The company developed a strategy to hedge the currency exposure related to these cash outlays.  A portion of this strategy included foreign currency option contracts with maturities of less than three months to protect Sysco from an increase in the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling.  This helped provide downside protection during the time frame the transaction was being reviewed for anti-trust approval and thereafter during the volatility around the referendum on June 23, 2016 in the United Kingdom to exit the European Union (the U.K. Referendum).  Such contracts were considered economic hedges and did not qualify for hedge accounting. Sysco recognized net losses on these contracts within Other expense (income), net on its consolidated results of operations. In fiscal 2016, the total realized net loss on our economic hedge foreign exchange option contracts was

$45.7 million

. As these amounts did not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value were recorded directly to earnings.  These contracts were terminated at or near the company's fiscal year end and did not have a material fair value as of July 2, 2016.  A second part of Sysco's strategy was to accumulate the cash needed for the acquisition once anti-trust approval was received.  The company did not use derivative instruments for this part of the strategy outside of the option contracts discussed above.  This accumulation occurred over a period of time prior to, as well as after, the U.K. Referendum.  During this period, the currency rates experienced large fluctuations, particularly with regard to the pound sterling.  The company's approach allowed it to accumulate this cash at an average rate that was better than the target exchange rate established at the time the transaction was announced.

The location and the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges in the consolidated balance sheet as of

July 2, 2016

,

June 27, 2015

and June 28, 2014 are as follows:

recorded directly in earnings within interest expense and was immaterial for fiscal


,


and


. The interest rate swaps do not contain credit-risk-related contingent features.

SELF-INSURED LIABILITIES

Sysco maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability and property insurance costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. The company also maintains a fully self-insured group medical program. A summary of the activity in self-insured liabilities appears below:

11.

DEBT AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Sysco’s debt consists of the following:


(1)

Represents senior notes that are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision that allows Sysco to retire the debentures and notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the debenture and note holders are not penalized by the early redemption.

(2)

This debenture is not subject to any sinking fund requirement and is no longer redeemable prior to maturity.

(3)

Represents senior notes that were redeemed in July 2015 under a mandatory redemption feature.

As of

July 2, 2016

, the principal payments required to be made during the next five fiscal years on long-term debt, excluding notes payable and commercial paper, are shown below:

Sysco has a commercial paper program allowing the company to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed

$1.5 billion

. As of

July 2, 2016

, there were

no

commercial paper issuances outstanding. Any outstanding amounts are classified within long-term debt, as the program is supported by a long-term revolving credit facility. During the first


weeks of


, aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged from

zero

to approximately

$1.0 billion

.

Senior notes redemption related to US Foods Merger

On June 26, 2015, Sysco terminated the US Foods merger agreement triggering the redemption of the senior notes that had been issued in contemplation of the proposed merger at a redemption price equal to

101%

of the principal of the senior notes. Sysco redeemed the senior notes in July 2015 using cash on hand and proceeds from our commercial paper program in the amount of

$5.1 billion

. The repayment of these senior notes triggered a redemption loss of

$86.5 million

included in interest expense for the first quarter of fiscal


. Additionally, as discussed in Note 6, "Derivative Financial Instruments," the company terminated fair value hedges associated with these senior notes.

Interest expense for fiscal 2016 includes the following amounts from these transactions:

Senior notes offering related to accelerated share repurchase

On September 28, 2015, Sysco issued senior notes totaling

$2.0 billion

. Details of the senior notes are as follows:

Sysco used the net proceeds from the offering to fund repurchases of outstanding shares of its common stock pursuant to Sysco’s

$1.5 billion

accelerated share repurchase program, to repay approximately

$500 million

of its outstanding commercial


paper and for general corporate purposes. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco’s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee Sysco’s other senior notes. Interest on the senior notes is paid semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1, beginning April 1, 2016. At Sysco’s option, any or all of the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to maturity. If Sysco elects to redeem (i) the senior notes maturing in 2020 before the date that is one month prior to the maturity date, (ii) the senior notes maturing in 2025 before the date that is three months prior to the maturity date or (iii) the senior notes maturing in 2045 before the date that is six months prior to the maturity date, Sysco will pay an amount equal to the greater of

100%

of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed that would be due if such senior notes matured on the applicable date described above. If Sysco elects to redeem a series of senior notes on or after the applicable date described in the preceding sentence, Sysco will pay an amount equal to

100%

of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed. Sysco will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed to the redemption date.

Bridge Term Loan Agreement

On March 14, 2016, Sysco entered into a £

1,725 million

bridge term loan agreement (the Bridge Term Loan Agreement) (approximately

$2,440 million

based on the applicable exchange rate as of

July 2, 2016

) to fund the proposed Brakes Group Acquisition. Subject to certain terms and conditions, Sysco would have been allowed to borrow up to £

1,725 million

as a term loan upon, or substantially contemporaneously with, the closing of the Brakes Acquisition to fund the Brakes Acquisition, refinance certain indebtedness of the Brakes Group and pay related fees and expenses.

The Bridge Term Loan Agreement was terminated by Sysco effective April 6, 2016 following the closing of the offering of $

2.5 billion

in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes.

Senior notes offering related to Brakes Group Acquisition

On April 1, 2016, Sysco issued senior notes totaling $

2.5 billion

in aggregate principal amount. Details of the senior notes are as follows:

Sysco used the net proceeds from the offering to fund the Brakes Acquisition. The notes initially are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco’s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee Sysco’s other senior notes. Interest on the senior notes maturing in 2019 and 2046 will be paid semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1, beginning October 1, 2016. Interest on the senior notes maturing in 2021 and 2026 is paid semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, beginning July 1, 2016. At Sysco’s option, any or all of the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to maturity. If Sysco elects to redeem (i) the senior notes maturing in 2019 before the maturity date, (ii) the senior notes maturing in 2021 before the date that is one month prior to the maturity date, (iii) the senior notes maturing in 2026 before the date that is three months prior to the maturity date or (iv) the senior notes maturing in 2046 before the date that is six months prior to the maturity date, Sysco will pay an amount equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed that would be due if such senior notes matured on the applicable date described above. If Sysco elects to redeem a series of senior notes on or after the applicable date described in the preceding sentence, Sysco will pay an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed. Sysco will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed to the redemption date.

On June 23, 2016, Sysco issued €

500 million

aggregate principal amount of its

1.250%

Senior Notes due


(the Euro Notes). The Euro Notes were sold in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated June 14, 2016, among Sysco, the Guarantors and representatives of the several underwriters. Sysco used the net proceeds from the Euro Note offering to pay a portion of the Brakes Acquisition purchase price. At Sysco’s option, any or all of the Euro Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to maturity. If Sysco elects to redeem the Euro Notes before the date that is two months prior to the maturity date, Sysco will pay an amount equal to the greater of

100%

of the principal amount of the Euro Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Euro Notes to be redeemed. If Sysco elects to redeem the Euro Notes on or after the date described in the preceding sentence, Sysco will pay an amount equal to

100%

of the principal amount of the Euro Notes to be redeemed. Sysco will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Euro Notes redeemed to the redemption date.

OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES

The following table presents details of the company’s other long-term liabilities:

14.

COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Sysco has company-sponsored defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees.  Also, the company provides certain health care benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents.

Defined Contribution Plans

The company operates a defined contribution 401(k) Plan as a Safe Harbor Plan, which is a plan that treats all employees’ benefits equally within the plan, under Sections 401(k) and 401(m) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to non-union employees and those union employees whose unions adopted the Safe Harbor Plan provisions.  The company will make a non-elective contribution each pay period equal to

3%

of a participant’s compensation.  Additionally, the company will make matching contributions of

50%

of a participant’s pre-tax contribution on the first

5%

of the participant’s compensation contributed by the participant.  Certain employees are also eligible for a transition contribution, and the company may also make discretionary contributions.  For union employees who are members of unions that did not adopt the Safe Harbor Plan provisions, the plan provides that under certain circumstances the company may make matching contributions of up to

50%

of the first

6%

of a participant’s compensation.

The company also has a nonqualified, unfunded Management Savings Plan (MSP) available to key management personnel who are participants in the Management Incentive Plan.  Participants may defer up to

50%

of their annual salary and up to

100%

of their annual bonus.  The company will make a non-elective contribution each pay period equal to

3%

of a participant’s compensation.  Additionally, the company will make matching contributions of

50%

of a participant’s pre-tax contribution on the first

5%

of the participant’s eligible compensation that is deferred.  Certain employees are also eligible for a transition contribution, and the company may also make discretionary contributions.  All company contributions to the MSP are limited by the amounts contributed by the company to the participant’s 401(k) account.


Sysco’s expense related to its defined contribution plans was

$135.5 million

in fiscal


,

$125.4 million

in fiscal


, and $

118.6 million

in fiscal


.

Defined Benefit Plans

Sysco maintains a qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan) that pays benefits to participating employees at retirement, using formulas based on a participant’s years of service and compensation.  This plan is frozen for all U.S.-based salaried and non-union hourly employees, as these employees are eligible for benefits under the company’s defined contribution 401(k) plan.

In addition to receiving benefits upon retirement under the company’s Retirement Plan, certain key management personnel who were participants in the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) are entitled to receive benefits under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).  This plan is a nonqualified, unfunded supplementary retirement plan.  This plan is frozen to all participants, and current MIP participants are eligible to participate in the MSP.

The company also provides certain health care benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents.

Funded Status

Accumulated pension assets measured against the obligation for pension benefits represents the funded status of a given plan.  The funded status of Sysco’s company-sponsored defined benefit plans is presented in the table below.  The caption “Pension Benefits” in the tables below includes both the Retirement Plan and the SERP.

(1)

Other Postretirement Plan amounts are the net of participant paid premiums and company paid claims.

In order to meet a portion of its obligations under the SERP, Sysco has contributed to a rabbi trust, COLI policies on the lives of participants and interests in corporate-owned real estate assets.  These assets are not included as plan assets or in the funded status amounts in the tables above and below.  The life insurance policies on the lives of the participants had carrying values of

$97.0 million

as of

July 2, 2016

and

$97.2 million

as of

June 27, 2015

.  Sysco is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies.


The amounts recognized on Sysco’s consolidated balance sheets related to its company-sponsored defined benefit plans are as follows:

Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income) as of

Employer Contributions

The company made cash contributions to its company-sponsored pension plans of

$157.5 million

and

$75.1 million

in fiscal years


and


, respectively.  The

$130 million

contribution to the Retirement Plan in fiscal


was voluntary, as there were no required contributions to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal


.  There are no required contributions to the Retirement Plan to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal


.  The company’s contributions to the SERP and other post-retirement plans are made in the amounts needed to fund current year benefit payments.  The estimated fiscal


contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other postretirement plans are

$29.5 million

and

$0.3 million

, respectively.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Estimated future benefit payments for vested participants, based on actuarial assumptions, are as follows:

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of year-end were:

As benefit accruals under the SERP are frozen, future pay is not projected in the determination of the benefit obligation as of

July 2, 2016

or

June 27, 2015

.


Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net company-sponsored pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs for each fiscal year were:

A healthcare cost trend rate is not used in the calculations of postretirement benefit obligations because Sysco subsidizes the cost of postretirement medical coverage by a fixed dollar amount, with the retiree responsible for the cost of coverage in excess of the subsidy, including all future cost increases.

For guidance in determining the discount rate, Sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the company-sponsored pension plans.  The discount rate assumption is updated annually and revised as deemed appropriate.  The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal


net company-sponsored benefit costs for the Retirement Plan is

4.07%

.  The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal


net company-sponsored benefit costs for the SERP is

3.91

%.  The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal


net company-sponsored benefit costs for the Other Postretirement Plans is

4.07

%.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is net return on assets assumption, representing gross return on assets less plan expenses.  The expected return is derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, the historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.  The expected long-term rate of return to be used in the calculation of fiscal


net company-sponsored benefit costs for the Retirement Plan is

7.25%

.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

The company’s overall strategic investment objectives for the Retirement Plan are to preserve capital for future benefit payments and to balance risk and return commensurate with ongoing changes in the valuation of plan liabilities.  Over time, the company intends to decrease the risk of the Retirement Plan’s investments in order to preserve the Retirement Plan’s funded status.  In order to accomplish these objectives, the company oversees the Retirement Plan’s investment objectives and policy design, decides proper plan asset class strategies and structures, monitors the performance of plan investment managers and investment funds and determines the proper investment allocation of pension plan contributions.  The company has created an investment structure for the Retirement Plan that takes into account the nature of the Retirement Plan’s liabilities.  This structure ensures the Retirement Plan’s investments are diversified within each asset class, in addition to being diversified across asset classes with the intent to build asset class portfolios that are structured without strategic bias for or against any subcategories within each asset class.  The company has also created a set of investment guidelines for the Retirement Plan’s investment managers to specify prohibited transactions, including borrowing of money except for real estate, private equity or hedge fund portfolios where leverage is a key component of the investment strategy and permitted in the investments’ governing documents, the purchase of securities on margin unless fully collateralized by cash or cash equivalents or short sales, pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating of any securities, except for loans of securities that are fully collateralized, market timing transactions and the direct purchase of the securities of Sysco or the investment manager.  The purchase or sale of derivatives for speculation or leverage is also prohibited; however, investment managers are allowed to use derivative securities so long as they do not increase the risk profile or leverage of the manager’s portfolio.


The company’s target and actual investment allocation as of

July 2, 2016

is as follows:

Sysco’s investment strategy is implemented through a combination of balanced and specialized investment managers, passive investment funds and actively-managed investment funds.  U.S. equity consists of both large-cap and small-to-mid-cap securities.  Long duration fixed income investments include U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds from diversified industries, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, other debt securities and derivative securities.  High yield fixed income consists of below investment grade corporate debt securities and may include derivative securities.  Alternative investments may include private equity, private real estate, hedge funds, timberland, and commodities investments.  Investment funds are selected based on each fund’s stated investment strategy to align with Sysco’s overall target mix of investments.  Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

As discussed above, the Retirement Plan’s investments in equities, debt instruments and alternative investments provide a range of returns and also expose the plan to investment risk.  However, the investment policies put in place by the company require diversification of plan assets across issuers, industries and countries.  As such, the Retirement Plan does not have significant concentrations of risk in plan assets.

Fair Value of Plan Assets

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price).  See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for a description of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities held by Sysco's Retirement Plan measured at fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents: Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments.  Cash and cash equivalents is included as a Level 1 measurement in the table below.

Equity securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market.  If a stock is not listed on a public exchange, such as an American Depository Receipt or some preferred stocks, the stock is valued using an evaluated bid price based on a compilation of observable market information.  Inputs used include yields, the underlying security “best price”, adjustments for corporate actions and exchange prices of underlying and common stock of the same issuer.  Equity securities valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market are classified as a Level 1 measurement in the table below.

Fixed income securities: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market.  Inputs used vary by type of security, but include spreads, yields, rate benchmarks, rate of prepayment, cash flows, rating changes and collateral performance and type.  All fixed income securities are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Investment funds: Represents collective trust and funds holding debt, equity, hedge funds, private equity funds,  and exchange-traded real estate securities which are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the manager of each fund.  The NAV is calculated as the underlying net assets owned by the fund, divided by the number of shares outstanding.  The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund.  Non-exchange traded real estate funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying real estate investments held by each fund.  Each real estate investment is valued on the basis of a discounted cash flow approach.  Inputs used include future rental receipts, expenses and residual values from a market participant view of the highest and best use of the real estate as rental property.  The private equity funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying private equity investments held


by each fund.  The hedge funds are valued based on the hedge funds' proportionate share of the net assets of the underlying private investment fund as determined by the underlying private investment fund's general partner. Indirectly-held investments are valued utilizing the latest financial reports supplied by the fund’s portfolio investments.  Directly-held investments are valued initially based on transaction price and are adjusted utilizing available market data and investment-specific factors, such as estimates of liquidation value, prices of recent transactions in the same or similar issuer, current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, changes in market outlook and the financing environment.

Derivatives:  Valuation method varies by type of derivative security.

•

Credit default and interest rate swaps:  Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information.  Inputs used for credit default swaps include spread curves and trade data about the credit quality of the counterparty.  Inputs used for interest rate swaps include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, and interdealer broker rates.  Credit default and interest rate swaps are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

•

Foreign currency contracts: Valued using a standardized interpolation model that utilizes the quoted prices for standard-length forward foreign currency contracts and adjusts to the remaining term outstanding on the contract being valued.  Foreign currency contracts are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

•

Futures and option contracts: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market for exchange-traded futures and options.  Over-the-counter options are valued using pricing models that are based on observable market information.  Exchange-traded futures and options are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table below; over-the-counter options are included as a Level 2 measurement.

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share (or its Equivalent)

, ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair values are estimated using the NAV practical expedient provided by Accounting Standards Codification 820,

Fair Value Measurement

. Disclosures about investments in certain entities that calculate NAV per share are limited under ASU 2015-07 to those investments for which the entity has elected to estimate the fair value using the NAV practical expedient. ASU 2015-07 is effective for entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, which is fiscal 2017 for Sysco, with retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is permitted. Sysco has elected to adopt ASU 2015-07 early.

MULTIEMPLOYER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Sysco contributes to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and Canada based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees.  Expense is recognized at the time the contribution is made.  Sysco does not directly manage these multiemployer plans, which are generally managed by boards of trustees, half of whom are appointed by the unions and the other half appointed by Sysco and the other employers contributing to the plan.  Approximately

9%

of Sysco’s current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans as of

July 2, 2016

.

The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:

•

Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.

•

If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.


•

If Sysco chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, Sysco may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

Based upon the information available from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded.  In addition, pension-related legislation in the U.S. requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding.  As a result, Sysco expects its contributions to these plans to increase in the future.  In addition, if a U.S. multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund.

Potential Withdrawal Liability

Under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans, a plan’s termination, Sysco’s voluntary withdrawal, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require Sysco to make payments to the plan for Sysco’s proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities.  Generally, Sysco does not have the greatest share of liability among the participants in any of the plans in which it participates.  Sysco believes that one of the above-mentioned events is reasonably possible for certain plans in which it participates and estimates its share of withdrawal liability for these plans could have been as much as

$86.0 million

as of

July 2, 2016

.  This estimate excludes plans for which Sysco has recorded withdrawal liabilities or where the likelihood of the above-mentioned events is deemed remote.  This estimate is based on the information available from plan administrators, which had a valuation date of December 31, 2013 and January 1, 2015 for a majority of the plans.  As the valuation date for all of these plans was December 31, 2013 and January 1, 2015, the company’s estimate reflects the condition of the financial markets as of that date.  Due to the lack of current information, management believes Sysco’s current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate.

Plan Contributions

Sysco’s contributions to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans were as follows for each fiscal year:

There were

no

payments for voluntary withdrawals included in contributions in fiscal


. Payments in fiscal


and


were

$1.4 million

and

$40.8 million

, respectively.

Individually Significant Plans

The information in the following tables relate to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans which Sysco has determined to be individually significant to the company.  To determine individually significant plans, the company evaluated several factors, including Sysco’s significance to the plan in terms of employees and contributions, the funded status of the plan and the size of company’s potential withdrawal liability if it were to voluntarily withdraw from the plan.

The following table provides information about the funded status of individually significant plans:

•

The “EIN-PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN).

•

The “Pension Protection Act Zone Status” columns provide the two most recent Pension Protection Act zone statuses available from each plan.  The zone status is based on information that the company received from the plan’s administrators and is certified by each plan’s actuary.  Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the orange zone are both less than 80% funded and have an accumulated funding deficiency or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next six plan years, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded.

•

The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates whether a financial improvement plan (FIP) for yellow/orange zone plans or a rehabilitation plan (RP) for red zone plans is pending or implemented in the current year or was put in place in a prior


year.  A status of “Pending” indicates a FIP/RP has been approved but actual period covered by the FIP/RP has not begun.  A status of “Implemented” means the period covered by the FIP/RP began in the current year or is ongoing.

•

The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge was paid during the most recent annual period presented for the company’s contributions to each plan in the red zone.  If the company’s current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with a plan satisfies the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented RP, then the payment of surcharges is not required and “No” will be reflected in this column.  If the company’s current CBA with a plan does not yet satisfy the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented RP, then the payment of surcharges is required and “Yes” will be reflected in this column.

(1)

Sysco is party to


CBAs that require contributions to the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust.  Each agreement covers anywhere from less than

1%

to

10%

of the total contributions Sysco is required to pay the fund.

(2)

Sysco is party to

three

CBAs that require contributions to the Teamsters Pension Trust Fund of Philadelphia and Vicinity.

One

agreement expires

July 31, 2016

and covers approximately

5%

of the total Contribution Sysco is required to pay the fund.  The remaining

two

agreements expire

July 20, 2020

and cover the remaining

95%

of the total contributions Sysco is required to pay the fund.

(3)

This fund has failed a Critical and Declining Notice, which is a new status under the MPRA.

The following table provides information about the company’s contributions to individually significant plans:

•

The “Sysco Contributions” columns provide contribution amounts based on Sysco’s fiscal years, which may not coincide with the plans’ fiscal years.

•

The “Sysco 5% of Total Plan Contributions” columns indicate whether Sysco was listed in the plan’s most recently filed Form 5500s as providing more than five percent of the total contributions to the plan, and the plan year-end is noted.


For all of the plans noted in the table above, minimum contributions outside of the agreed upon contractual rate are not required.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to the contributions to the defined benefit pension plans described above, Sysco also contributes to several multiemployer plans that provide other postretirement benefits based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees.  These plans may provide medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, mental health and other benefits to active employees and retirees as determined by the trustees of each plan.  Sysco contributed to these plans

$25.9 million

in fiscal


,

$28.5 million

in fiscal


and

$29.7 million

in fiscal


.  There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of fiscal


, fiscal

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Accelerated Share Repurchase Program

On September 23, 2015, the company entered into a Master Confirmation and Supplemental Confirmation (collectively, the ASR Agreement) with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman) relating to an accelerated share repurchase program (the ASR Program). Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, Sysco agreed to repurchase

$1.5 billion

of its common stock from Goldman.

In connection with the ASR Program, the company paid

$1.5 billion

to Goldman on September 28, 2015, in exchange for

32,319,392

shares of the company’s outstanding common stock; however, the number of shares ultimately delivered to the company by Goldman was subject to adjustment based on the volume-weighted average share price of the company's common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount. All purchases under the ASR Program were completed on May 23, 2016, resulting in Sysco receiving an additional

2,396,788

shares from Goldman at settlement.

The receipt of

34,716,180

shares is included in Treasury stock and reduced the company's weighted average common shares outstanding for fiscal


.  The adjustment feature, which was based on the volume-weighted average share price, was considered a forward contract indexed to Sysco's own common stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under several share-based payment arrangements including various employee stock long-term incentive plans, a non-employee director plan and the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).

Stock Incentive Plans

In November 2013, Sysco’s Long-term Incentive Plan (2013 Plan) was adopted and reserved up to

55,600,000

shares of Sysco common stock for share-based awards to employees, non-employee directors and key advisors. Of the

55,600,000

authorized shares, the full

55,600,000

shares may be issued as options or stock appreciation rights and up to

17,500,000

shares may be issued as restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of stock-based awards. To date, Sysco has issued options and restricted stock units under the 2013 Plan. Vesting requirements for awards under the 2013 Plan vary by individual grant and may include either time-based vesting or time-based vesting subject to acceleration based on performance criteria for fiscal periods of at least

one

year. The contractual life of all options granted under the 2013 Plan are and will be no greater than

ten

years. As of

July 2, 2016

, there were

38,535,843

remaining shares authorized and available for grant in total under the 2013 Plan, of which the full

38,535,843

shares may be issued as options or stock appreciation rights, or as a combination of up to

13,964,784

shares that may be issued as restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of stock-based awards, with the remainder available for issuance as options or stock appreciation rights.

Sysco has also granted employee options under several previous employee stock option plans for which previously granted options remain outstanding as of

July 2, 2016

. No new options will be issued under any of the prior plans, as future grants to employees will be made through the 2013 Plan or subsequently adopted plans. Awards under these plans are subject to time-based vesting with vesting periods that vary by individual grant. The contractual life of all options granted under these plans is

seven

years.

In November 2009, Sysco’s 2009 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (2009 NED Plan) was adopted and provides for the issuance of up to

750,000

shares of Sysco common stock as share-based awards to non-employee directors. The authorized shares may be granted as restricted stock, restricted stock units, elected shares or additional shares. Vesting requirements for awards under the 2009 NED Plan varies by individual grant and include either time-based vesting or vesting based on performance criteria. As of

July 2, 2016

, there were a total of

270,074

remaining shares authorized and available for grant under the 2009 NED Plan.

Stock Options

Sysco’s option awards are subject to graded vesting over a requisite service period with compensation cost recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period over the duration of the award.

In addition, certain of Sysco’s options provide that the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued as an employee or director if the optionee meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement. In these cases, Sysco will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement.

The fair value of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of Sysco’s stock, implied volatilities from traded options on Sysco’s stock and other factors. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Sysco utilizes historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately in determining the expected life of awards for valuation purposes.

The weighted average assumptions discussed above are noted in the table below for relevant periods as follows:


The following summary presents information regarding outstanding options as of

July 2, 2016

and changes during the fiscal year then ended with regard to options under all stock incentive plans:

The total number of employee options granted was

and

1,322,709

were granted to employees, respectively, the majority of which will vest ratably over a

three

-year period. Some of these restricted stock units were granted with dividend equivalents. The fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. For restricted stock unit awards granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value was reduced by the present value of expected dividends as of the date of grant date during the vesting period. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock units granted during fiscal

were granted to non-employee directors (NED's), respectively, that will vest over a one-year period. NED's may elect to receive these awards in restricted stock shares that will vest at the end of the award stated vesting period or as deferred units that convert into shares of Sysco common stock on a date subsequent to the award stated vesting date selected by the NED. The fair value of the restricted awards is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of the shares granted during fiscal


,


and


was

$40.59

,

NED's may elect to receive up to

100%

of their annual directors’ fees in Sysco common stock on either an annual or deferred basis. Sysco provides a matching grant of

50%

of the number of shares received for the stock election subject to certain limitations. As a result of such elections, a total of

25,185

,

23,949

and

24,565

shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of

$39.31

,

$38.26

and

$34.59

fully vested deferred units outstanding that will convert into shares of Sysco common stock upon dates selected by the respective NED.


Summary of Non-vested Awards

The following summary presents information regarding outstanding non-vested awards as of

July 2, 2016

and changes during the fiscal year then ended with regard to these awards under the stock incentive plans. Award types represented include restricted stock units granted to employees and restricted awards granted to non-employee directors.

Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan

Sysco has an ESPP that permits employees to invest in Sysco common stock by means of periodic payroll deductions at a discount of

15%

from the closing price on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The total number of shares which may be sold pursuant to the ESPP may not exceed

79,000,000

shares, of which

9,935,892

remained available as of

July 2, 2016

.

During fiscal


,

1,275,765

shares of Sysco common stock were purchased by the participants, as compared to

1,243,275

shares purchased in fiscal


and

1,315,535

shares purchased in fiscal


. The weighted average fair value of employee stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the ESPP was

$6.04

INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Provisions

For financial reporting purposes, earnings before income taxes consists of the following:

The income tax provision / (benefit) for each fiscal year consists of the following:


The current and deferred components of the income tax provisions for each fiscal year are as follows:

The deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net changes during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Significant components of Sysco’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

The company’s net operating tax loss carryforwards as of

July 2, 2016

and

June 27, 2015

consisted primarily of state net operating tax loss carryforwards.  The state net operating tax loss carryforwards outstanding as of

July 2, 2016

expire in fiscal years 2017 through 2035.  There were no valuation allowances recorded for the state tax loss carryforwards as of

July 2, 2016

and

June 27, 2015

because management believes it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized based on utilization forecasts.


Effective Tax Rates

Reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates for each fiscal year are as follows:

(1)

Uncertain tax positions are included within "Other" for fiscal


and


.

The effective tax rate of

33.7%

for fiscal


was favorably impacted by the favorable resolution of tax contingencies resulting in tax benefits of

$29.6 million

(

$10.6 million

in tax and

$19.0 million

in interest).  Costs associated with the redemption of the senior notes that had been issued in contemplation of the proposed merger with US Foods and charges incurred from the revision to the Company's business technology strategy resulted in lower state taxes. Indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of

31.9%

for fiscal


was favorably impacted by lower earnings in the U.S. primarily from the termination of the US Foods merger agreement, litigation costs, merger integration planning costs and interest expense attributable to the proposed merger of

$693 million

for the fiscal year.  These costs were attributed to the company's U.S. earnings, which has the highest tax rate of all of the jurisdictions where it remits taxes.  These losses created low levels of earnings in the U.S. and generated net operating losses in certain states, making the company's indefinitely reinvested earnings in its foreign operations a more predominant factor in its effective tax rate because those operations have lower tax rates.   Additionally, Sysco made the decision to amend a prior U.S. tax return in order to maximize a foreign tax credit as opposed to a foreign tax deduction which also created benefit in our effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of

36.9%

for fiscal


was negatively impacted primarily by two items.  First, the company recorded tax expense of

$6.2 million

related to a non-deductible penalty that the company incurred.  Second, the company recorded net tax expense of

$5.2 million

for tax and interest related to various federal, foreign and state uncertain tax positions.  This negative impact was partially offset by the recording of

$5.7 million

of tax benefit related to disqualifying dispositions of Sysco stock pursuant to share-based compensation arrangements.  Indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate.

Uncertain Tax Positions

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:

As of

July 2, 2016

, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was

$14.9 million

.  As of

June 27, 2015

, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was

$33.4 million

.  The expense recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal


fiscal


was not material.

If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of

July 2, 2016

, approximately

$16.9 million

of the

$24.6 million

reserve would reduce the effective tax rate.  If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of

June 27, 2015

, approximately

$27.7 million

of the

$37.5 million

reserve would reduce the effective tax rate.  It is reasonably


possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the company’s unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease in the next twelve months either because Sysco’s positions are sustained on audit or because the company agrees to their disallowance.  Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax benefits primarily include the consideration of various filing requirements in various states and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions.  In addition, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized within the next twelve months may decrease due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain years in various jurisdictions; however, it is possible that a jurisdiction may open an audit on one of these years prior to the statute of limitations expiring.  At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.

Sysco's federal tax returns for 2006 and subsequent tax years have been audited and/or have statutes of limitations that remain open for audit.  As of

July 2, 2016

, Sysco’s tax returns in the majority of the state and local jurisdictions and Canada are no longer subject to audit for the years before 2009.  However, in Canada, the company remains open to transfer pricing adjustments back to 2003 for some entities.  Certain tax jurisdictions require partial to full payment on audit assessments or the posting of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process.  Although the outcome of tax audits is generally uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been accrued for any adjustments that may result from those open years.

Other

Undistributed income of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries at

July 2, 2016

amounted to

$1.2 billion

, for which no deferred U.S. income tax provision has been recorded because Sysco intends to indefinitely reinvest such income in those foreign operations.  An estimate of any U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes that may be applicable upon actual or deemed repatriation is not practical due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.

21.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

Sysco is engaged in various legal proceedings which have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated.  The likelihood of loss for these legal proceedings, based on definitions within contingency accounting literature, ranges from remote to reasonably possible to probable.  When probable and reasonably estimable, the losses have been accrued.  Based on estimates of the range of potential losses associated with these matters, management does not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company.  However, the final results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and if the company failed to prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses were to exceed the company’s current estimates of the range of potential losses, the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected in future periods.

Fuel Commitments

Sysco routinely enters into forward purchase commitments for a portion of its projected diesel fuel requirements.  As of

July 2, 2016

, we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately

$84.9 million

through May 2017.

Other Commitments

Sysco has committed to aggregate product purchases for resale in order to benefit from a centralized approach to purchasing.  A majority of these agreements expire within one year; however, certain agreements have terms through fiscal 2021.  These agreements commit the company to a minimum volume at various pricing terms, including fixed pricing, variable pricing or a combination thereof.  Minimum amounts committed to as of

July 2, 2016

totaled approximately

$1.8 billion

.  Minimum amounts committed to by year are as follows:


Sysco has contracts with various third party service providers to receive information technology services.  The services have been committed for periods up to fiscal 2019 and may be extended.  As of

July 2, 2016

, the total remaining cost of the services over that period is expected to be approximately

$418.3 million

.  A portion of this committed amount may be reduced by Sysco utilizing less than estimated resources and can be increased by Sysco utilizing more than estimated resources.  Certain agreements allow adjustments for inflation.  Sysco may also cancel a portion or all of the services provided subject to termination fees that decrease over time.  If Sysco were to terminate all of the services in fiscal


, the estimated termination fees incurred in fiscal


would be approximately

$21.8 million

.

22.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The company has aggregated certain of its operating companies into

two

reporting segments, Broadline and SYGMA in accordance with the accounting literature related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise. The Broadline reportable segment is an aggregation of the company’s Broadline segments located in the Bahamas, Canada, Costa Rica, Ireland, Mexico and the United States. Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. "Other" financial information is attributable to the company's other operating segments, including the company's specialty produce, custom-cut meat operations, lodging industry segments, a company that distributes specialty imported products,  a company that distributes to international customers and the company’s Sysco Ventures platform, which includes a suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of Sysco’s customers.  In fiscal 2015, our leadership structure was realigned and now our custom-cut meat operations no longer report through our Broadline leadership.  As a result, these operations are no longer included in our Broadline segment and are now reported in "Other."  Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by Sysco for its consolidated financial statements.  Intersegment sales primarily represent products the Broadline and SYGMA operating companies procured from the specialty produce, custom-cut meat operations, imported specialty products and a company that distributes to international customers. Management evaluates the performance of each of the operating segments based on its respective operating income results. Corporate expenses generally include all expenses of the corporate office and Sysco’s shared service center. These also include all share-based compensation costs.


The following tables set forth certain financial information for Sysco’s business segments:


The sales mix for the principal product categories for each fiscal year is as follows:

Information concerning geographic areas is as follows:


23.

SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION - SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES

On January 19, 2011, the wholly owned U.S. Broadline subsidiaries of Sysco Corporation entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and debentures of Sysco Corporation. Borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility supporting the company’s U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs are also covered under these guarantees. As of

July 2, 2016

, Sysco had a total of

$7.4 billion

in senior notes, debentures and commercial paper outstanding that was covered by these guarantees.

All subsidiary guarantors are

100%

owned by the parent company, all guarantees are full and unconditional and all guarantees are joint and several, except that the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor with respect to a series of senior notes or debentures may be released under certain customary circumstances. If we exercise our defeasance option with respect to the senior notes or debentures of any series, then any subsidiary guarantor effectively will be released with respect to that series.  Further, each subsidiary guarantee will remain in full force and effect until the earliest to occur of the date, if any, on which (1) the applicable subsidiary guarantor shall consolidate with or merge into Sysco Corporation or any successor of Sysco Corporation or (2) Sysco Corporation or any successor of Sysco Corporation consolidates with or merges into the applicable subsidiary guarantor.

The following condensed consolidating financial statements present separately the financial position, comprehensive income and cash flows of the parent issuer (Sysco Corporation), the guarantors (the majority of the company’s U.S. Broadline subsidiaries), and all other non‑guarantor subsidiaries of Sysco (Other Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries) on a combined basis with eliminating entries.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Brakes Acquisition and Hedging Transactions

On July 5, 2016, following the end of fiscal year 2016, Sysco closed the Brakes Acquisition. The aggregate enterprise value paid by Sysco in connection with the Brakes Acquisition was approximately

£2.3 billion

(approximately

$3.1 billion

based on exchange rates on July 5, 2016), and included the repayment of approximately

$2.3 billion

of the Brakes Group's then outstanding financial debt. The purchase price was paid primarily in cash from recent debt issuances and other cash on hand, and was subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The Brakes Group is now wholly owned by Sysco.

In conjunction with the closing of the Brakes Acquisition, Sysco entered into various net investment hedge transactions and cross currency swap transactions in order to mitigate foreign exchange risk. Sysco designated Euro Notes issued in June 2016 and various intercompany notes as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated and Sterling-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates to U.S. Dollar exchange rates will be recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).   The company entered into various cross currency swaps to mitigate the risk of exchange rate changes when an intercompany loan is not in the functional currency of one of its subsidiaries.  These have been designated as cash flow hedges with changes to be recorded within foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Additional cross currency swaps were entered into to create additional net investment hedges.

None.


Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Sysco’s management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

July 2, 2016

.  The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.  Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Sysco’s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.  Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

July 2, 2016

, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, Sysco’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included in the financial statement pages at page 51.

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended

July 2, 2016

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
