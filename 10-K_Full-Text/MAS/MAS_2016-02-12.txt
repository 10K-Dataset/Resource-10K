PART I

Item 1.    Business.

Masco Corporation is a global leader in the design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of branded home improvement and building
products. Our portfolio of industry-leading brands includes KRAFTMAID® and MERILLAT® cabinets; DELTA®, PEERLESS®, and HANSGROHE® faucets,
bath and shower fixtures; HOT SPRING® and CALDERA® spas; BEHR® paint, primer and stain; KILZ® primer; LIBERTY® and BRAINERD®
decorative hardware; and MILGARD® windows and doors. We leverage our powerful brands across product categories, sales channels and geographies to create value for our customers and
shareholders.

During
2015, we further advanced our strategy to position the Company for future growth by focusing on three strategic pillars: driving the full potential of our core businesses,
leveraging opportunities across our businesses, and actively managing our portfolio. We achieved gains in each of these areas.

First,
to drive the full potential of our core businesses, we pursued sales growth opportunities in adjacent markets and products, continued the deployment of standardized operating
tools across the enterprise, executed cost saving initiatives and expanded our implementation of lean principles and process improvements in many areas, including production and functional support
processes.

We
also continued to leverage the collective strength of our enterprise, the second pillar of our strategy. We provided new assignments to selected leaders across our business units to
further develop talent and facilitate operational improvements. We continued to realize supply chain efficiencies through strategic sourcing, and we continued to share best practices across all of our
functional departments to enhance productivity. As a result, our operating results (excluding the impact of foreign currency translation) improved across all of our segments, particularly at our U.S.
cabinets business.

The
third pillar of our strategy is to actively manage our portfolio. On June 30, 2015, we completed the spin off of our Installation and Other Services businesses into an
independent, publicly-traded, company, TopBuild Corp., through a tax-free distribution to our shareholders. As a result of the spin off, our business has become less dependent on new home
construction, and is, therefore, less cyclical, and a greater portion of our sales are derived from international markets. In addition, we acquired two businesses in 2015 that complement our existing
portfolio. First, we expanded our product offering and distribution channels into the aquatic fitness category with the acquisition of the ENDLESS POOLS® brand. We also acquired Evolution
Manufacturing, which expands
our offering of fiberglass and composite windows in the United Kingdom. To further enhance value creation for our shareholders, during 2015 we repurchased over 17 million shares of our common
stock and increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 6 percent.

We
believe that the actions we took during 2015 have positioned our company for further enhancement of shareholder value. We also believe that completion of the spin off allows us to
pursue a more focused strategy of growth. We will continue to actively manage our portfolio, identify growth opportunities in key industries and produce new products that differentiate us in the
marketplace by combining design and innovation. By continuing our disciplined execution of our strategy, we believe that we will increase shareholder value.

Our Business Segments

We report our financial results in four business segments aggregated by similarity in products and services. The following table sets
forth the contribution of our segments to net sales and operating profit (loss) for the three years ended December 31, 2015. Additional financial information concerning our operations by
segment and by geographic regions, as well as general corporate expense, net, as of and



for
the three years ended December 31, 2015, is set forth in Note P to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

the Decorative Architectural Products segment.

All
of our operating segments, except the Plumbing Products segment, normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters, corresponding with the peak season
for repair and remodel activity and new home construction.

Cabinets and Related Products

In North America, we manufacture and sell value-priced, stock and semi-custom assembled cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home
office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points to address consumer preferences. Our product offerings in this segment also include the fabrication and sale of
integrated bathroom vanity and countertop products. In the United Kingdom, we manufacture and sell kitchen, bath, and storage cabinetry. Our KRAFTMAID® brand is sold primarily to dealers
and home center retailers, and our MERILLAT®, QUALITY CABINETS™, MOORES™ and CARDELL® brands are sold primarily to dealers and homebuilders for both
home improvement and new home construction. Cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both retail consumers spending and new home construction, particularly spending for major
kitchen and bathroom renovation projects. A significant portion of our sales for home improvement are made through home center retailers.

Our
Cabinets and Related Products segment was particularly affected by the economic downturn and decline in new home construction and repair and remodel activity that began in 2008.
Consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects is improving, including large kitchen and bath remodeling projects, but continues to be below normal levels, which impacts our profitability. Home
construction is also improving and is expected to continue to improve. Demand has increased for multi-family housing units, which are generally smaller and require fewer kitchen and bathroom cabinets
than single-family housing units. Our initiatives to improve this segment have been complex, time-consuming and expensive. Although the operating results of our cabinetry businesses improved in 2015,
we continue to



focus
on obtaining profitable sales, reducing our cost structure and improving cabinet production efficiencies. We are pursuing strategies to increase sales through new product introductions and
enhanced customer service, and to rationalize a portion of our customer base in our builder channel to focus on opportunities that offer more profitable growth.

The
cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States and the United Kingdom includes several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors, and in the United Kingdom,
foreign manufacturers. In recent years, we have experienced significant competition in the form of new product offerings by our competitors, which have impacted the segment's results of operations.
Additional local and regional competitors may enter this industry as conditions improve. In addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality,
responsiveness to customer needs, product features and selection. Some of our North American competitors include American Woodmark Corporation, Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. and
Elkay.

The
raw materials used in this segment are primarily hardwood lumber, plywood and particleboard, and are available from multiple sources, both domestic and foreign.

Plumbing Products

The businesses in our Plumbing Products segment sell a wide variety of products that are manufactured or sourced by us. The majority of
our faucet, bathing and showering devices are sold in North America and Europe under the brand names DELTA®, PEERLESS®, HANSGROHE®, AXOR®,
BRIZO®, GINGER®, NEWPORT BRASS®, BRASSTECH® and PLUMB SHOP®. Our BRISTAN™ and HERITAGE™ products are principally
sold in the United Kingdom. These plumbing products include faucets, showerheads, handheld showers, valves, bathing units, shower enclosures and toilets and are sold to home center retailers and to
wholesalers and distributors that, in turn, sell them to plumbers, building contractors, remodelers, smaller retailers and consumers.

Our
acrylic tub and shower systems, bath and shower enclosure units and shower trays are manufactured and sold under the DELTA, PEERLESS, and MIROLIN® brand names. These
products are sold primarily to home center retailers for home improvement and new home construction in North America. Our MIROLIN products are also sold to wholesalers and distributors in Canada. Our
HÜPPE® shower enclosures are sold through wholesale channels in Europe and China.

Our
spas and exercise pools are manufactured and sold under HOT SPRING®, CALDERA®, FREEFLOW SPAS®, FANTASY SPAS®, ENDLESS
POOLS® and other trademarks. Spa products are sold to independent specialty retailers or online mass merchant retailers, while exercise pools are available on a consumer direct basis.
Competitors include Jacuzzi, Master Spas and Dynasty Spas.

Also
included in our Plumbing Products segment are brass and copper plumbing system components and other plumbing specialties, which are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware
wholesalers, home center retailers, hardware stores, building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These products are marketed in North America for the wholesale trade under our
BRASSCRAFT®, PLUMB SHOP®, COBRA®, BRASSTECH®, and MASTER PLUMBER® trademarks, and are also sold under private label.

We
believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in North America and Europe. Our major competitors include Lixil Group Corporation's American Standard Brands and
Grohe products, Kohler Co., Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc. and Spectrum Brands Holdings, LLC's Pfister faucets. We also experience competition from foreign
manufacturers, including Grohe, particularly in Germany, China and the Middle East. We face significant competition from private label products. Many of the faucet and showering products with which
our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressure on price. The businesses in our Plumbing Products segment manufacture products in the United States,
Europe and Asia and source products from Asia and other regions. In addition to price, we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer



selection.
Competition for our plumbing products is based largely on service, product quality, product innovation and features and breadth of product offering.

Many
of our plumbing products contain brass, the major components of which are copper and zinc. We have multiple sources, both domestic and foreign, for the raw materials used in this
segment, and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs. We have encountered price volatility for brass, brass components and any components containing copper and zinc; therefore, we
have implemented a hedging strategy to help reduce the impact of this volatility.

Decorative Architectural Products

We produce architectural coatings, including paints, primers, specialty paint products, stains and waterproofing products. These
products are sold in North America, China,
and South America under the brand names BEHR®, BEHR PRO® and KILZ® to "do-it-yourself" and professional customers through home center retailers and other retailers.
Net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 25 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our BEHR products are sold through The Home Depot, our largest
customer and this segment's largest customer. The loss of this segment's sales to The Home Depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment's business and on our consolidated business as a
whole.

Our
competitors include large national and international brands such as Benjamin Moore, Glidden, Olympic, PPG, Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Zinsser, as well as many regional and other
national brands. In addition to price, we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection, and that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality,
technology and product innovation, and customer service. In 2015, we introduced a new BEHR® COLOR SOLUTIONS® Center, designed to enhance the color selection process and overall
shopping experience, in all North American The Home Depot stores.

Fluctuations
in raw material costs can have a material impact on our operating results in this segment. Titanium dioxide and acrylic resins derived from crude oil and natural gas are
used in the manufacturing of architectural coatings. Significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas can adversely affect this segment's results of operations. Global supply and demand
dynamics and production capacity limitations can cause fluctuations in the price of titanium dioxide and acrylic resins, which can impact our results. We have agreements with the significant suppliers
of the major raw materials used in this segment which are intended to help assure continued availability.

Our
Decorative Architectural Products segment also includes branded cabinet, door, window and other hardware, which are manufactured for us and sold to home center retailers, other
retailers, original equipment manufacturers and wholesalers. These products are sold under the LIBERTY® and BRAINERD® brands. Key competitors in North America include Amerock,
Top Knobs and house brands. Decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under the brand names DELTA® and FRANKLIN BRASS® to distributors, home center retailers and
other retailers. Competitors include Moen, Gatco and private label brands.

Other Specialty Products

We manufacture and sell vinyl, fiberglass and aluminum windows and patio doors, as well as the ESSENCE SERIES® windows and
doors, which combines a wood interior with a fiberglass exterior, under the MILGARD® brand name for home improvement and new home construction, principally in the western United States.
MILGARD
products are sold primarily through dealers and, to a lesser extent, directly to production and custom homebuilders and through lumber yards and home center retailers. Our North American competitors
for these products include national brands, such as Jeld-Wen, Marvin, Pella and Andersen, and numerous regional brands.



In
the United Kingdom, we manufacture and sell vinyl windows, composite and panel doors, related products and components under several brand names including DURAFLEX™,
GRIFFIN™, PREMIER™ and EVOLUTION™. Sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the repair and remodeling markets, although our DURAFLEX products are also
sold to other window fabricators. United Kingdom competitors include many small and mid-sized firms and a few large, vertically integrated competitors.

In
addition to price, we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection and that competition in this industry in both the domestic and foreign markets is
based largely on product quality, innovative products and customer and warranty services.

We
manufacture and sell a complete line of manual and electric heavy duty staple guns, hammer tackers, glue guns and rivet tools as well as the staples, glue and rivets that complement
our products. We sell these products primarily in North America under the brand names ARROW®, POWERSHOT® and EASYSHOT® to professional contractors and
do-it-yourself consumers through various distribution channels, including home center and other retailers and wholesalers. Our principal North American competitor in this product line is Stanley
Black & Decker.

The
raw materials used in this segment have been available from multiple sources, although our U.S. window business has, at times, experienced allocation of glass from its suppliers.

Additional Information

Intellectual Property

We hold numerous U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary
manufacturing processes. As a manufacturer and distributor of brand name products, we view our trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important, but do not believe that there is any
reasonable likelihood of a loss of such rights that would have a material adverse effect on our present business as a whole.

Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Business

We are subject to U.S. and foreign government regulations, particularly those pertaining to health and safety (including protection of
employees and consumers), climate disruption and environmental issues. Our businesses are subject to requirements regarding protection of the environment and worker health and safety and have certain
responsibilities for environmental remediation.

•

Our Cabinets and Related Products segment is subject to requirements relating to the emission of volatile organic compounds, which may
impact our sourcing of particleboard and may require that we install special equipment in manufacturing facilities.

•

Our Decorative Architectural Products segment is also subject to the requirements relating to the emission of volatile organic
compounds, which may require us to reformulate paint products.

•

Certain products in our Plumbing Products segment are subject to restrictions on lead content and on waterflow.

Compliance
with these laws and regulations significantly affects product performance as well as our production costs. We monitor applicable laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment, climate disruption and worker health and safety, and incur ongoing expense relating to compliance. We do not expect compliance with the federal, state and local
regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety, will result in material capital
expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position.



Backlog

We do not consider backlog orders to be material in any of our segments.

Employees

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 25,000 people. We have generally experienced satisfactory relations with our
employees.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.

There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business. These risks and uncertainties could cause our
actual results to differ from past performance or expected results. We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most
relevant to our specific business activities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity, both of which are cyclical.

A significant portion of our business relies on home improvement, including repair and remodeling projects, of which our reliance has
increased following the spin off of TopBuild Corp. ("TopBuild") in 2015. Our business also relies on new home construction activity. Macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Europe, including consumer
confidence levels, fluctuations in home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels, consumer income and debt levels, household formation and the availability of home equity loans and mortgages
and the interest rates for such loans, affect both consumers' discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity. While improving, both consumer spending for
big ticket remodeling projects and new home construction continue to be below historic average levels. Adverse changes or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline
in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction, both of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.

If we do not maintain strong brands, develop new products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences we could lose market share.

Our competitive advantage is due, in part, to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and
improved products. While we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness, these initiatives may not be successful. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and
improved products, such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling these products, may impact the success of our product introductions.
If we do not introduce new or improved products in a timely manner or if these products do not gain widespread acceptance, we could lose market share, which could negatively impact our operating
results.

In
recent years, consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers' business models and strategies have changed. Consumers are increasingly using the internet
and mobile technology to research home improvement products and to inform and provide feedback on
their purchasing and ownership experience for these products. E-business is a rapidly developing area, and the refinement and execution of a successful e-business strategy involves significant time,
investment and resources. If we are unable to successfully execute our e-business strategy, our brands may lose market share.

While
U.S. demand for single-family houses is increasing, the demand for multi-family housing units such as apartments and condominiums continues to be elevated compared to historic
levels. Multi-family units typically are smaller than single-family houses and require fewer kitchen and bathroom cabinets than single-family houses. If this demand mix remains, it may limit our
growth opportunities.

If
we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences, our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be
harmed, the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations could be negatively affected.



We face significant competition.

Our products face significant competition. We believe that brand reputation is an important factor impacting product selection and that
we compete on the basis of product features and innovation, product quality, customer service, warranty and price. Home center retailers continue to purchase products in our segments directly from
low-cost foreign manufacturers for sale as private label merchandise. Additionally, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers,
are increasingly marketing directly to professional contractors and installers, which may impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and
wholesalers.

We
sell many of our products through distributors and independent dealers and we rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers. Our success with these customers
is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery. Additionally, in these channels as well as at home center retailers, we compete with foreign manufacturers in a variety of
our product groups. Some of these foreign manufacturers are putting downward pressures on price. As market dynamics change, we may experience a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward
more value-priced or opening price point products, which may impact our ability to maintain or gain market share and/or our profitability.

Our
ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries depends upon maintaining strong brands, developing and innovating products, maintaining strong relationships with our
customers, managing our cost structure, executing a successful e-business strategy, accommodating customer demands for new and improved products on a shorter cycle, implementing growth strategies and
entering new domestic and international areas, none of which is assured.

Our sales are concentrated with two significant customers.

As a result of the spin off of TopBuild in 2015, the mix of our business operations has changed and the concentration of our sales to
our two largest customers has increased and may continue to increase. In 2015, net sales to our largest customer, The Home Depot, were $2.4 billion (approximately 33 percent of our
consolidated net sales). In 2015, net sales to Lowe's, our second largest customer, were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales. If the mix of our business operations continues to change,
including as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, our reliance on these significant customers may further increase. These home center retailers can significantly affect the prices we receive for
our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them. Additionally, these home center customers may reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make
significant changes in their volume of purchases. Although other retailers, dealers, distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services, the loss of a
substantial portion of our sales to The Home Depot or the loss of all of our sales to Lowe's would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Further,
as some of these home center retailers expand their markets and targeted customers and as consumer purchasing practices change and e-commerce increases, conflicts between our
existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur, which could impact our results of operations. Our relationships with our customers may be impacted if we increase the amount of business
we transact directly with consumers. In addition, our large retail customers request product exclusivity from time to time, which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may
diminish our ability to leverage economies of scale.

We may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives.

We continue to pursue our strategic initiatives, which are designed to increase shareholder value over the mid- to long-term. Our
business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are



unable
to successfully execute these initiatives, or if we are unable to execute them in a timely and efficient manner. We could also be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage
change throughout our organization.

Pursuing
the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth. If we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or
consummate potential acquisitions, our long-term competitive positioning may be impacted. Even if we are successful in acquiring businesses, we may experience risks in integrating these businesses
into our existing business. Such risks include difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale, diversion of our resources, unforeseen liabilities, issues with the new or existing
customers or suppliers, and difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses. Future foreign acquisitions may also increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks
associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations. Our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs and/or fail to realize the anticipated benefits of
our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations.

We may not be able to sustain the turnaround in our cabinetry businesses.

Our initiatives to improve our cabinetry operations have been complex, time-consuming and expensive. Although the operating results of
our cabinetry businesses improved in 2015, we continue to focus on obtaining profitable sales, reducing our cost structure and improving production efficiencies. Our strategies in these areas require
time to implement, execute and assess and may not be successful. If the improvement in our cabinetry businesses cannot be
sustained or if the pace of the improvement slows, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.

Variability in commodity costs or limited availability of commodities could impact us.

We buy various commodities to manufacture our products, including, among others, brass, resins, titanium dioxide, zinc, wood and glass.
In addition, water is a significant component of many of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions. Fluctuations in the availability and prices of these
commodities could increase our costs to manufacture our products. Further, increases in energy costs could increase our production costs as well as our transportation costs, each of which could
negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.

It
has been, and likely will continue to be, difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs. Our existing arrangements with
customers, competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices. If we are not able to increase the prices of our products or
achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. If we are able to increase our selling prices,
sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of market share, particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices. When commodity prices decline, we have
experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices. Such reductions could impact our operating results.

To
help reduce price volatility associated with certain anticipated commodity purchases, we use derivative instruments, including commodity futures and swaps. This strategy increases the
possibility that we may make commitments to purchase these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices, which has and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition
and operating results. We also have agreements with certain significant suppliers to help assure continued availability.



We are dependent on third-party suppliers.

We rely heavily on third-party suppliers for many of our products and components, and our ability to offer a wide variety of products
depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of these products and components. Failure by our suppliers to provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms, or to comply with
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. Resourcing these products and components to another supplier could
take time and involve significant costs. Accordingly, the loss of critical suppliers, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers, could disrupt our
business and adversely impact our operating results.

Many
of the suppliers upon whom we rely are located in foreign countries. The differences in business practices, shipping and delivery requirements and laws and regulations, together
with the limited number of suppliers, have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling. If we are unable to effectively
manage our supply chain, our operating results could be negatively affected.

There are risks associated with international operations and global strategies.

Approximately 21 percent of our sales are made outside of North America (principally in Europe) and are transacted in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. Following the TopBuild spin off, a greater proportion of our sales occurs outside of the U.S., and increasing our international sales is an important part of our strategic
plans. In addition to our European operations, we manufacture products in Asia and source products and components from third parties globally. Risks associated with our international operations
include changes in political, monetary and social environments, labor conditions and practices, the laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, social and political unrest, terrorist
attacks, cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights.

Our
operating results are also impacted by international economic conditions, primarily in Europe. As our sales made outside of the U.S. have increased, we have experienced a greater
negative impact from currency conversion rates, particularly the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling, on our results of operations due to the strength of the U.S. dollar compared
to foreign
currencies. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period.

U.S.
laws and regulations regarding activities of U.S. companies doing business abroad, including tax laws, laws regulating competition, anti-bribery/anti-corruption and other business
practices, and trade regulations, which may include duties and tariffs, can also affect us. While it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative impact on our international tax
structure, it is possible that significant changes in how U.S. and foreign jurisdictions tax cross-border transactions could adversely impact our financial results.

We may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property.

Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our growth and innovation efforts. We own a number of patents, trade names, brand
names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights
will prevent violations. Our intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected. In
addition, the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms. Furthermore, others may assert
intellectual property infringement claims against us. Protecting and defending our intellectual property could be costly, time consuming and require significant resources. If we are not able to
protect our existing



intellectual
property rights, or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names, increased
litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position, which could affect our results of operations.

The long-term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented personnel.

To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel who have the experience, knowledge and
expertise to successfully implement our key business strategies. We compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries, including large multinational firms, and we
invest significant resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract and retain key employees, or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth
transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess, could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results. If we are unable to recruit, train and retain
sufficient skilled and unskilled labor, we may not be able to adequately satisfy increased demand for our products and services, and our operating results could be adversely affected.

Claims and litigation could be costly.

We are involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and
which could have a material adverse effect on us. These matters may include competition, products liability, employment, warranty disputes, advertising claims, contract disputes, personal injury
claims, environmental claims or proceedings, and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions.

We
are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can damage
the reputation of our brands and business and can be costly to defend or manage. Also, we rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell. Due to the
difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse
against such suppliers.

We
intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously; however, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the
outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter. In recent years, we have experienced class action lawsuits predicated upon claims for product liability and wage and hour issues, and we may be
subject to other consumer claims in the future. We have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended
these cases. Due to their scope and complexity, however, these lawsuits can be particularly costly to defend and resolve, and we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of these
types of lawsuits.

We
maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available
insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant accident, judgment,
claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also experience
increased costs for insurance coverage that could impact our financial results.

See
Note U to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses.



Compliance with laws, government regulation and industry standards could impact our operating results.

We are subject to federal, state and foreign government regulations, particularly those pertaining to health and safety (including
protection of employees and consumers), product compliance, competition practices, import and export regulations, climate disruption and environmental issues. In addition to complying with current
requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date, even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future. Additionally, some of our products must be certified
by industry organizations. Compliance with these laws, regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs, our manufacturing processes or our sourcing. Further, compliance
activities are costly and require significant management attention and resources. If we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards, our results of operations
could be negatively affected.

We rely on information systems and technology, and disruptions to these systems could impact our operating results.

We rely on a number of information systems and technology to process, transmit, store and manage information to support our business
activities, and we have plans to make significant investments in new technology systems. We may be adversely impacted if our information systems are disrupted or fail, or if we do not appropriately
select and implement our new technology systems in a timely manner. In addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our systems, increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities,
threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify
and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our systems may be damaged,
disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may
be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure
to litigation, and increased operational costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant
customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.

Restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility.

We must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement, and in order to borrow under it, we cannot be in
default with any of those provisions. Our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be impacted if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the
financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants. In the past, we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement, but there can be no assurance that in the future we
would be able to further amend them. If we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement, our financial flexibility would be restricted if we were also unable to obtain alternative financing on
acceptable terms and at acceptable rates or if we were not permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements.

The TopBuild spin off could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.

We received an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the spin off and certain
related transactions qualify for tax-free treatment under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the
delivery of the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including



those
relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinion. Furthermore, the opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. If,
notwithstanding receipt of the opinion, the spin off transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the
spin off transaction is taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of TopBuild in connection with the spin off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of
property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received, thereby potentially increasing such holder's tax liability.

Even
if the spin off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significant
acquisitions of our stock or the stock of TopBuild are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin off. In this event, the resulting tax liability could be
substantial. In connection with the spin off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with TopBuild, pursuant to which TopBuild agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of
the spin off to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction. These obligations and potential tax liabilities may discourage,
delay or prevent a change of control of us.

On
January 31, 2016, there were approximately 4,200 holders of record of our common stock.

We
expect that our practice of paying quarterly dividends on our common stock will continue, although the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and
will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors.

In
September 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 50 million shares, for retirement of our common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise,
replacing the previous authorization established in 2007. During 2015, we repurchased and retired 17 million shares of our common stock for cash aggregating $456 million. The following
table provides information regarding the repurchase of our common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2015.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our
consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

The
following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute "forward-looking statements"
under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "appear," "may," "will," "should," "intend," "plan,"
"estimate," "expect," "assume," "seek," "forecast" and similar references to future periods. Our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and,
accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forward-looking statements. We caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements.

In
addition to the various factors included in the "Executive Level Overview," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Outlook for the Company" sections, our future performance
may be affected by the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction, our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce new and improved products, our ability to
maintain our competitive position in our industries, our reliance on key customers, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives, our ability to sustain the performance
of our cabinetry businesses, the cost and availability of raw materials, our dependence on third party suppliers, and risks associated with international operations and global strategies. These and
other factors are discussed in detail in Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Report. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it was made. Factors or events that
could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Executive Level Overview

We design, manufacture, market and distribute branded home improvement and building products. These products are sold for home
improvement and new home construction through home center retailers, mass merchandisers, hardware stores, homebuilders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the
consumer.

2015 Results

Net sales were positively affected by increased repair and remodel activity and new home construction in the U.S. and Europe, favorable
product mix, net selling price increases and acquisitions. Such increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar compared to the Euro. Our
results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume, operational efficiencies due to benefits resulting from cost savings initiatives and a more favorable relationship between
selling prices and commodity costs.

Our
Cabinets and Related Products segment was positively affected by operational efficiencies due to benefits resulting from business rationalization activities and other cost saving
initiatives and decreased business rationalization expenses. Our Plumbing Products segment benefited from increased sales volume and a favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs
and was negatively impacted by unfavorable product mix and an increase in certain variable expenses. The Decorative Architectural Products segment benefited from increased sales volume of paints and
stains and builders' hardware, a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs in



paints
and stains and operational efficiencies due to benefits associated with cost savings initiatives. Our Other Specialty Products segment benefited from increased volume, a more favorable product
mix of U.S. windows and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of windows in the U.S. and the U.K.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and
various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Note A
to our consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies, estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

We
believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition and Receivables

We recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. We record
estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. We
monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on-going basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of customers to make required payments.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other
identifiable intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. We selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to
what would be used by other market participants. We have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level, as defined by GAAP.

Determining
market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions
and appropriate discount rates. Our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While we believe
that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes. In estimating future cash flows, we rely
on internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and, currently, a one to three percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows
for periods after the five-year forecast. We generally develop these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales



data
for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated repair and remodel activity and estimated housing starts. Our assumptions included a relatively stable U.S. Gross
Domestic Product ranging from 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent and a euro zone Gross Domestic Product ranging from 1.5 percent to 1.8 percent over the five-year forecast.

We
utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 8.5 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. Our weighted
average cost of capital decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to less risk associated with our stock in relation to the capital markets. In 2015, based upon our assessment of the risks
impacting each of our businesses, we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 10.5 percent to 12.5 percent for our reporting units.

If
the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting
unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair value of a reporting
unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of goodwill.

In
the fourth quarter of 2015, we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values. Accordingly, we did not
recognize any impairment charges for goodwill.

A
10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at December 31, 2015 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for
any reporting unit.

We
review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired
without regard to the business unit. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and
expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term. In 2015, we did not recognize any impairment charges for
other indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Employee Retirement Plans

Effective January 1, 2010, we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and
non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans.

Accounting
for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon vested years of service, and attributing those costs over
the time period each employee works. We develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on
plan assets, mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. While we
believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different
estimates and assumptions could result in different reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2015, our discount rate increased for obligations to an average of 4.0 percent from 3.8 percent. The discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected
duration of each defined-benefit pension plan's liabilities matched to the December 31, 2015 Towers Watson Rate Link curve. The discount rates we use for our defined-benefit pension plans
ranged from 2.0 percent to 4.3 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 4.0 percent or higher. The assumed asset
return was primarily 7.25 percent, reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.



Our
net underfunded amount for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, decreased to
$401 million at December 31, 2015 from $454 million at December 31, 2014. Our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans was
$174 million at December 31, 2015 compared with $190 million at December 31, 2014.

The
decrease in the projected benefit obligations was primarily due to lower bond rates and a change to the MP 2015 Mortality Improvement Scale issued by the U.S. Society of Actuaries,
which decreased our long-term pension liabilities. Our qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2015 had a net loss of 1.8 percent.

At
December 31, 2015, we reported a net liability of $575 million, of which $174 million was related to our non-qualified, supplemental retirement plans, which are
not subject to the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. In accordance with the Pension Protection Act, the Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage for the various
defined-benefit pension plans ranges from 78 percent to 114 percent.

We
expect pension expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $24 million in 2016 compared with $22 million in 2015. If we assumed that the future return
on plan assets was one-half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points, the 2016 pension expense would increase by $5 million. We expect
pension expense for our non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $9 million in 2016, compared to $10 million in 2015.

We
anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately $25 million in 2016 to our qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit plans. Refer to Footnote M for further
information regarding the funding of our plans.

Income Taxes

Deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Possible sources of
taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate
future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.

If,
based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a
valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company's three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative
evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable, and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the
deferred tax assets.

In
2010, we recorded a $372 million valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. In reaching this conclusion, we
considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the U.S. housing market which led to U.S. operating losses and significant U.S.
goodwill impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative U.S. loss position.

During
2012 and 2011, objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as U.S. operating losses and significant impairment charges for U.S. goodwill and other intangible assets,
continued to outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance. As a result, we recorded increases of $65 million and $87 million in the valuation allowance related
to our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets in 2012 and 2011, respectively.



In
the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal and certain state deferred tax assets due
primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our U.S. operations. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and
remodel activity in the U.S. and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our U.S. operations
over the past few years.

In
the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an additional $12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain U.K. and Mexican deferred tax assets
primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions.

We
continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize
our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. The need to maintain a
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.

The
current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the
taxing authorities. We believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent
complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent.

While
we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions.
Accordingly, additional provisions for tax-related matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters
are settled or otherwise resolved.

Warranty

At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace
products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. Our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the
warranty coverage, the warranty period, historical experience specific to the nature, frequency and average cost to service the claim, along with industry and demographic trends.

Certain
factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors. We believe that
the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals.

A
significant portion of our business is at the consumer retail level through home center retailers and other major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is
a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us. Our revenue recognition policy takes into
account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale.

Litigation

We are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business. Liabilities and costs associated with
these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel. When estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted
claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance,



amounts
are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments.

Corporate Development Strategy

We expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing core
businesses and complementing our existing business with smaller, strategic acquisitions. We acquired two businesses in 2015, Endless Pools and Evolution Manufacturing. Endless Pools expanded our
product offering and distribution channels into the aquatic fitness category. Evolution Manufacturing expanded our offering of fiberglass and composite windows in the United Kingdom. We believe these
acquisitions will accelerate the growth of, and complement, our current businesses, Watkins Manufacturing and our UK-based window company, respectively. Longer-term, we may seek larger, strategic
acquisitions as our company continues to grow.

In
addition, during the financial recession of the last decade, we actively managed our portfolio of companies by divesting of those businesses that did not align with our long-term
growth strategy, including, in 2015, the spin off of our Installation and Other Services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named TopBuild. We will continue to review all of our
businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our long-term growth strategy.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations, long-term bank debt and the issuance of notes
in the financial markets, and by the issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are
among our financial
strategies. We also intend to pay down between $300 million and $500 million of our debt over the next several quarters.

Our
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 98 percent and 75 percent at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

On
June 15, 2015, we repaid and retired all of our $500 million, 4.8% Notes on the scheduled retirement date.

On
March 24, 2015, we issued $500 million of 4.45% Notes due April 1, 2025. These Notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option.

On
March 28, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of
March 28, 2018. On May 29, 2015 and August 28, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement with the bank group (the "Amended Credit Agreement"). The Amended Credit Agreement reduces the
aggregate commitment to $750 million and extends the maturity date to May 29, 2020. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, at our request and subject to certain conditions, we can increase
the aggregate commitment up to an additional $375 million with the current bank group or new lenders. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements.

The
Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (A) a maximum net leverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, of 4.0 to 1.0, and (B) a
minimum interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, equal to or greater than 2.5 to 1.0. We were in compliance with all covenants and had no borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement
at December 31, 2015.

We
had cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits of approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest
bearing money market demand accounts, time deposit accounts, money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. While we attempt to diversify these investments in a
prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments.



Of the $1.7 billion of cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits we held at both December 31, 2015 and 2014, $630 million and
$672 million, respectively, is held in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., their repatriation into the U.S. would not result in significant
additional U.S. income tax or foreign withholding tax, as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted.

We
utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the European euro, British pound and the U.S. dollar; commodity cost
fluctuations, primarily zinc and copper; and interest rate fluctuations, primarily related to debt issuances. We review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk management on a
regular basis.

In
the third quarter of 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend to $.095 per common share from $.09 per common share.

Our
current ratio was 1.3 to 1 and 1.6 to 1 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the current ratio was due to the approximately $500 million
increase in short-term notes payable at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 due to scheduled debt maturities.

Net
cash provided by operations of $699 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of
$133 million, a $212 million net increase in deferred taxes and other non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense related to in-store displays.

Net
cash used for financing activities was $410 million, primarily due to the retirement of $500 million of 4.8% Notes due June 2015, $456 million for the repurchase
and retirement of company common stock (as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value, and includes 741 thousand shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of long-term
stock awards granted in 2015), $126 million for cash dividends paid and $36 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest. Other financing activities include the issuance of
$497 million of notes, $75 million tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and $200 million of cash received from TopBuild as a result of its new debt financing agreement,
offset by $63 million of cash distributed to TopBuild.

In
September 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise,
replacing the previous Board of Directors authorization established in 2007. At December 31, 2015, we had remaining authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to an additional
27.8 million shares of our common stock. Consistent with past practice, we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2016 as part of our strategic initiative. As part of our capital management
strategy, we expect to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock in 2016. Some of these shares will be purchased to offset any dilution from long-term stock awards granted as part of
our compensation programs.

We
believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment needs. We believe that our longer-term
working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities.

Net
cash used for investing activities was $189 million, and included $158 million for capital expenditures, $41 million for acquisitions of companies, net of cash
acquired, and $43 million for in-store displays. Investing activities also include net cash provided from the sale of short-term bank deposits of $26 million.

We
continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations to increase our productivity, improve customer service and support new product innovation. Capital expenditures for
2015 were $158 million, compared with $128 million for 2014 and $126 million for 2013. For 2016, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2016 acquisitions, are expected to
be approximately
$190 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 totaled $133 million, compared with $167 million for 2014 and $186 million for 2013, including accelerated
depreciation of $1 million and $13 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. For 2016, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2016 acquisitions, is expected to be
approximately $140 million. Amortization expense totaled $11 million, $10 million and $11 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Costs
of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor do we expect them to have, a material effect on our capital
expenditures, financial position or results of operations.

Consolidated Results of Operations

We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP in the United States. However, we believe that certain non-GAAP performance
measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods.
Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results under GAAP.



Sales and Operations

Net sales for 2015 were $7.1 billion, which increased two percent compared with 2014. Excluding acquisitions and the unfavorable
effect of currency translation, net sales increased five percent compared to 2014. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency
translation, in millions:

Net
sales for 2015 were positively affected by increased sales volume of plumbing products, paints and stains, windows and builders' hardware, which, in aggregate, increased sales by
approximately four percent compared to 2014. Net sales for 2015 were also positively affected by selling price increases of plumbing products, cabinets and windows, which, in aggregate, increased
sales approximately one percent. Sales mix of North American cabinets and windows also positively affected 2015 net sales. Net sales for 2015 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets
and lower selling prices of paints and stains.

Net
sales for 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume of North American plumbing products, paints and stains, builders' hardware and U.S. windows, which, in aggregate,
increased sales by approximately three percent compared to 2013. Net sales for 2014 were also positively affected by selling prices for cabinets, international plumbing products, and windows, which,
in aggregate, increased sales by approximately two percent. Net sales for 2014 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets and by lower selling prices of paints and stains.

Net
sales for 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume of North American cabinets (such increase in cabinets was partially offset by a less favorable product mix),
plumbing products, paints and stains, builders' hardware and windows. Net sales of international plumbing products and cabinets also increased sales.

Our
gross profit margins were 31.5 percent, 29.4 percent and 29.0 percent in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2015 and 2014 gross profit margins were
positively affected by increased sales volume as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. Both 2015 and 2014 reflect the benefits associated with business
rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 18.7 percent in 2015 compared with 19.2 percent in 2014 and 19.9 percent in 2013. Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2015 and 2014 reflect increased sales and the effect of cost containment measures.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other, net, for 2015 included net gains of $6 million from investments in private equity funds and $2 million from equity
investments. Other, net, for 2015 also included realized foreign currency losses of $14 million and other miscellaneous items.

Other,
net, for 2014 included net gains of $4 million from investments in private equity funds and realized foreign currency gains of $5 million and other miscellaneous
items. Income from financial investments, net, for 2014 included losses from equity investments, net, of $2 million.

Other,
net, for 2013 included income from equity investments, net, of $16 million and gains of $11 million from investments in private equity funds. Other, net, for 2013
also included realized foreign currency losses of $21 million and other miscellaneous items.

In
2013, in conjunction with the transaction to sell our Danish ready-to-assemble cabinet business (included in discontinued operations), we also disposed of a related Danish holding
company. This disposition triggered the settlement of loans, which resulted in the recognition of $18 million of currency translation expense, which is included in other income (expense), net,
from continuing operations in the statement of operations.

Interest
expense was $225 million in 2015 and 2014, and $235 million in 2013.

Income and Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations (Attributable to Masco Corporation)

Income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2015 were $357 million and $1.03 per common share,
respectively. Income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2014 were $821 million and $2.28 per common share, respectively. Income and diluted income per common
share from continuing operations for 2013 were $259 million and $.72 per common share, respectively.

Our
effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 43 percent tax expense, 71 percent tax benefit and 22 percent tax expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Compared to our normalized tax rate of 36 percent, the variance in 2015 is primarily due to a $21 million valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets of
TopBuild recorded as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. The TopBuild deferred tax assets have been impaired by our decision to spin off TopBuild into a separate company that on a stand-alone
basis as of June 30, 2015, the spin off date, will unlikely be able to realize the value of such deferred tax assets as a result of its history of losses.



The 2015 effective tax rate also includes a $19 million charge to income tax expense to recognize the required taxes on substantially all undistributed
foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted. This charge was the result of our determination that we may need to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that were
previously considered permanently reinvested in order to provide greater flexibility in the execution of our capital management strategy.

The
variance from our normalized tax rate in 2014 and 2013 is due primarily to changes in the U.S. Federal valuation allowance and reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions.

Outlook for the Company

During 2015, we made progress on our strategic priorities, which include leveraging opportunities across our businesses, driving the
full potential of our core businesses and actively managing our portfolio.

We
believe we will continue to see steady demand for our market-leading products, as both repair and remodel demand and new home construction continue to improve. We believe and are
confident that the long-term fundamentals for home improvement activity and new home construction continue to be positive. We believe that our strong financial position, together with our current
strategy of investing in our industry-leading branded building products, including KRAFTMAID® and MERILLAT® cabinets, DELTA®, PEERLESS® and
HANSGROHE® faucet bath and shower fixtures, HOT SPRING® and CALDERA® spas, BEHR® paint primer and stain, KILZ® primer, LIBERTY®
and BRAINERD® decorative hardware, and MILGARD® windows and doors, our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to operational excellence and disciplined capital
allocation will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.

Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general corporate
expense, net, and income from litigation settlements.

Business Rationalizations and Other Initiatives

Over the last several years, we have taken several actions focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including
business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions and other cost savings initiatives. For the years ended December 31, 2015,
2014 and 2013, we incurred net pre-tax costs and charges related to these initiatives of $18 million, $64 million, and $47 million, respectively.

We
continue to realize the benefits of our business rationalizations and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise and expect to identify additional opportunities to
improve our business operations. We do not anticipate that any costs and charges related to our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will be as significant as they have been in previous years.

During
2015, our Plumbing segment incurred costs of $9 million primarily related to severance and other cost savings initiatives across multiple businesses. Our cabinet business
continued to incur costs and charges of $5 million primarily related to cost savings initiatives in North America. Our corporate office incurred $4 million in costs primarily related to
severance actions.

During
2014, our North American cabinet business incurred costs and charges of $31 million primarily related to actions taken to sell two previously idled manufacturing
facilities. Our corporate office incurred $27 million in costs primarily related to severance actions. Finally, we incurred $6 million of costs and charges across our business units
related to other cost savings initiatives.



During
2013, our North American cabinet business incurred costs and charges of $11 million related to the closure of a cabinet components facility and additional severance. Our
Plumbing Products segment incurred costs of $16 million related to a plant consolidation and severance in our bathing systems business in North America. Finally, we incurred $20 million
of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives.

Based
on current plans, we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate $8 million in 2016. We continue to evaluate
our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges.

Cabinets and Related Products

Sales

Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products increased three percent in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales increased primarily due to a
favorable sales mix and selling price of North American and international cabinets, which increased sales by six percent compared to 2014. Net sales decreased due to decreased sales volumes in both
North America and international cabinets, which on a combined basis decreased sales by three percent compared to 2014.

Net
sales in this segment in 2014 decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix of North American operations, which decreased sales by nine percent
compared to 2013. Such decreases more than offset increased selling prices in North America and increased sales volume and a more favorable product mix of international cabinets, which increased sales
by seven percent compared to 2013.

Net
sales in this segment in 2013 increased primarily due to increased sales volume of North American and International operations and by increased selling prices in North America. Such
increases were partially offset by a less favorable product mix in North America.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Cabinets and Related Products segment in 2015 were positively affected by operational efficiencies due to the
benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives and decreased business rationalization expenses. Operating margins were also positively affected by a
more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and a favorable product mix.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2014 were negatively affected by lower North American sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed costs as well as increased business
rationalization expenses. Operating margins were also negatively affected by a less favorable product mix. Such declines more than offset a more favorable relationship between selling prices and
commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with such expenses incurred in prior years.
Operating margins were also positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, as well as increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed
costs. Such increases were partially offset by a less favorable product mix.



Plumbing Products

Sales

Net sales of Plumbing Products increased one percent in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales increased primarily due to increased sales
volume of North American and international operations, which increased sales by five percent, and selling price increases primarily related to international operations, which increased sales by two
percent. An acquisition also positively impacted sales by one percent compared to 2014. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by seven percent compared to 2014, primarily due to the stronger U.S.
dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, segment sales increased by eight percent in 2015.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2014 primarily due to increased sales volume of both North American and International operations, which, in aggregate, increased sales by four
percent compared to 2013. This segment was also positively affected by increased selling prices of International plumbing products.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2013 primarily due to increased sales volume, increased selling prices and a weaker U.S. dollar. Such increases were partially offset by the loss
of a portion of our bath products business.

Operating Results

Operating margins in this segment in 2015 were negatively impacted by unfavorable product mix, as well as an increase in certain
variable expenses such as trade show and marketing expenses and legal-related expenses. Such decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume and a favorable relationship between selling
prices and commodity costs (including the negative impact of metal hedge contracts). Although operating margins were not significantly impacted, foreign currency translation, primarily due to a
stronger U.S. dollar, negatively impacted operating profit by six percent compared to 2014.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume, a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs (including the
positive impact of the metal hedge contracts), lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs (including the
negative impact of the metal hedge contracts), partially offset by a less favorable product mix.

Decorative Architectural Products

Sales

Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased in 2015, primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and stains related
to the expansion of the BEHR PRO® business and increased sales volume of builders' hardware. Such increases were partially offset by lower selling prices, higher promotions of paints and
stains and an unfavorable currency impact of Canadian paints and stains sales.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2014, primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and stains related to new product introductions and other growth initiatives and increased
sales volume of builders' hardware, partially offset by lower selling prices of paints and stains.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2013, primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders' hardware, partially offset by lower selling prices of paints and
stains.



Operating Results

Operating margins in the Decorative Architectural Products segment increased in 2015, reflecting operational efficiencies due to
benefits associated with cost savings initiatives, a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders' hardware. Such
increases were partially offset by an increase in advertising and display expenses. Operating margins were also negatively impacted by unfavorable currency effects from our Canadian operating results
due to the stronger U.S. dollar in 2015.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2014 reflect a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, a less favorable product mix of paints and stains and costs
for new product introductions and advertising. Such decreases more than offset the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 reflect the benefits of increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders' hardware. Such benefits were partially offset by a less
favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and increased promotional and advertising costs.

Other Specialty Products

Sales

Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased eight percent in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales increased primarily due to increased
sales volume and a favorable product mix of North American windows in the Western U.S., which, on a combined basis, increased sales by seven percent compared to 2014. An acquisition positively
impacted sales by one percent compared to 2014. This segment was also positively affected by selling price increases, increased sales volume and a favorable mix of our U.K. windows business compared
to 2014. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by two percent compared to 2014.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2014 primarily due to more favorable product mix, increased selling prices and increased sales volume of North American windows in the Western U.S.
which, in aggregate, increased sales by eight percent compared to 2013. This segment was also positively affected by a more favorable product mix and increased selling prices of our U.K. windows
business, which increased sales in this segment by two percent compared to 2013. A weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by one percent in 2014 compared to 2013. Such increases were partially offset by
lower sales volume and lower selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2013 primarily due to increased sales volume, increased selling prices and a more favorable product mix of windows in North America. Such increases
were partially offset by lower sales volume and lower selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Other Specialty Products segment increased in 2015 primarily due to a higher sales volume and favorable mix of
windows in the Western U.S., and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of windows in the U.S. and U.K. Such increases were partially offset by an increase in certain
expenses such as advertising and system implementation costs in 2015.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2014 reflect a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, a more favorable product mix of U.S. and U.K. windows and
increased sales volume in the western U.S. Such positive results were partially offset by lower sales volume and lower selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.



Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 reflect increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed costs, as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and
commodity costs. This segment also reflects the benefits associated with the business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Such positive results were partially offset by lower sales
volume and lower selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.

Geographic Area Results Discussion

North America

Sales

North American net sales in 2015 were positively impacted by increased sales volume of plumbing products, paints and stains, windows
and builders' hardware which more than offset negative sales volume of cabinets. In aggregate, sales volume increased North American sales by approximately four percent compared to 2014. Net sales
were also positively impacted by a favorable sales mix of North American cabinets and windows, which in aggregate, increased sales by approximately one percent compared to 2014. Net sales were also
positively affected by increased selling prices of cabinets, plumbing products and windows, which increased sales by approximately one percent compared to 2014. An acquisition also positively impacted
sales by one percent compared to 2014. Such increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar and lower selling prices of paints and stains.

North
American net sales in 2014 were positively impacted by increased sales volume of plumbing products, paints and stains, builders' hardware and windows which, in aggregate, increased
sales by approximately four percent compared to 2013. Net sales were also positively affected by increased selling prices of cabinets and windows, which increased sales by approximately one percent
compared to 2013. Such increases were partially offset by lower sales volume of cabinets and lower selling prices of paints and stains.

North
American net sales in 2013 were positively impacted by increased sales volume of plumbing products, paints and stains, windows, cabinets (such increase in cabinets was partially
offset by a less favorable product mix), and builders' hardware, as well as increased selling prices of cabinets and windows. Such increases were partially offset by lower selling prices of paints and
stains.

Operating Results

Operating margins from North American operations in 2015 were positively affected by increased sales volume, as well as a more
favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. North American operations were also positively affected by the benefits associated with past business rationalization and other cost
savings initiatives and decreased business rationalization expenses.

Operating
margins from North American operations in 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume, as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity
costs. North American operations were also positively affected by the benefits associated with past business rationalization and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating
margins from North American operations in 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed costs, as well as a more favorable
relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. North American operations were also positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with business
rationalization and other cost savings initiatives.



International, Principally Europe

Sales

Net sales from International operations decreased by eight percent in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar in
2015. In local currencies (including sales in foreign currencies outside their respective functional currencies), net sales increased five percent compared to 2014, primarily due to increased selling
prices and sales volume for international plumbing products. An acquisition also positively impacted net sales by one percent compared to 2014, partially offset by lower sales volumes for
international cabinets.

Net
sales from International operations in 2014 increased four percent in local currencies compared to 2013, primarily due to increased selling prices and sales volume for international
plumbing products and a more favorable product mix of cabinets and windows. A weaker U.S. dollar increased international net sales by one percent in 2014 compared to 2013.

Net
sales from International operations in 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume of international plumbing products and cabinets and increased selling prices for
international plumbing products.

Operating Results

Operating margins from International operations in 2015 were negatively affected by unfavorable product mix and increased costs to
support future sales growth initiatives, partially offset by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, primarily related to international plumbing products. Although
operating margins were not significantly impacted, foreign currency translation, primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar, negatively impacted operating profit by 14 percent compared to 2014.

Operating
margins from International operations in 2014 were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, primarily related to
international plumbing products.

Operating
margins from International operations in 2013 were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, primarily related to
international plumbing products and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives, partially offset by a less favorable product mix.

Other Matters

Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

Information regarding our legal proceedings is set forth in Note U to the consolidated financial statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Other Commitments

We enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which we
operate. Such indemnifications
include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, we occasionally provide reasonable and
customary indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; and provisions for sales returns. We have never had to pay a material
amount related to these indemnifications, and we



evaluate
the probability that amounts may be incurred and we appropriately record an estimated liability when probable.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-8 ("ASU 2014-08"), "Reporting
of Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposals of Components of an Entity," which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies
the related disclosure requirements. We adopted this guidance beginning January 1, 2015. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or our
results of operations.

In
November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17 ("ASU 2015-17"), "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which changes the criteria for classifying
deferred tax balances by requiring all deferred taxes be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We retrospectively adopted this guidance on December 31, 2015. As a result of the
retrospective adoption of this standard, current assets decreased by $244 million, non-current assets increased by $219 million and non-current liabilities decreased by
$25 million as of December 31, 2014.

In
May 2014, FASB issued a new standard for revenue recognition, Accounting Standards Codification 606 ("ASC 606"). The purpose of ASC 606 is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability across industries. ASC 606 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our results of operations.

In
February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02 ("ASU 2015-02") "Consolidation (Topic 810) – Amendments to the Consolidations Analysis," which
modifies certain aspects of both the variable interest entities and voting interest entities models. ASU 2015-02 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2016. We do not
expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations.

In
April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 ("ASU 2015-03") "Interest – Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) –
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," that requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to clarify that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements may remain classified as an asset. Both ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective
for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2016. We do not expect that the adoptions will have a significant impact on our financial position.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We have considered the provisions of accounting guidance regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial
instruments and derivative commodity instruments, and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments
and derivative commodity instruments.

We
are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity costs in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related
to our financial investments. We have involvement with derivative financial instruments and use such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and
commodity fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments.

At
December 31, 2015, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change
of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates, a 10 percent decline in the market value of our long-term investments, a 10 percent change in commodity costs, or a
10 percent change in interest rates. Based upon the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.



Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Masco Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Masco Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The
management of Masco Corporation assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 using the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in "Internal Control – Integrated Framework." Based on this assessment, management has determined that
the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, performed an audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of
Masco Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Their report expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Masco Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 and expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's 2015 consolidated financial statements. This report appears under 'Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' under the heading "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm."



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Masco Corporation:

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Masco Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Masco Corporation and all majority-owned
subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. We consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of variable interest entities, for which we are the primary beneficiary.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates
and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are
rendered, net of
applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. Amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in net sales, while costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of
sales.

Customer Promotion Costs.

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special
pricing and
co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. In-store displays that are owned by us and used to market our products are included in other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets and are amortized using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of three to five years; related amortization expense is classified as a selling expense in
the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Currency.

The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
Assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. The
resulting cumulative translation adjustments have been recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders' equity. Realized foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net.

Cash and Cash Investments.

We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash and
cash
investments.

Short-Term Bank Deposits.

We invest a portion of our foreign excess cash in short-term bank deposits. These highly liquid investments
have original
maturities between three and twelve months and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. These short-term bank deposits are classified in the current
assets section of our consolidated balance sheets, and interest income related to short-term bank deposits is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Receivables.

We do significant business with a number of customers, including certain home center retailers and homebuilders. We
monitor our exposure
for credit losses on our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on-going basis and record related allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are estimated
based upon specific customer balances,
where a risk of default has been identified, and also include a provision for non-customer specific defaults based upon historical collection, return and write-off activity. During downturns in our
markets, declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impacts the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer
defaults. A separate allowance is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally based upon sales activity. Receivables are presented net of certain allowances (including allowances for
doubtful accounts) of $41 million at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment, including significant improvements to existing facilities, are recorded at cost. Upon
retirement or
disposal, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations. Maintenance and repair costs are charged
against earnings as incurred.

We
review our property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount
and the current fair value. Further, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the
remaining depreciation periods.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense is computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Annual
depreciation rates are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10 percent, and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation expense was $116 million,
$132 million and $147 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Such depreciation expense included accelerated depreciation of $1 million (in the Cabinets and Related Products
segment) and $13 million (primarily in the Cabinets and Related Products and Plumbing Products segments) in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

We perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or as
events occur or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of
goodwill at the operating segment level. Our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities, for which discrete financial information, including five-year forecasts, are
available. We compare the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow method,
which includes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).

Determining
market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions
and appropriate discount rates. Our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

While we believe that the estimates
and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in
different outcomes. In estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and, currently, a one to three
percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five-year forecast. We utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 8.5 percent as the basis to
determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. Our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to less risk associated with our stock in
relation to the capital markets. In 2015, based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses, we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of
10.5 percent to 12.5 percent for our reporting units.

If
the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting
unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair value of a reporting
unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of goodwill.

We
review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may
be impaired without regard to the business unit. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal
(e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term.

Intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable
intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. See Note H for additional information
regarding Goodwill and Other intangible assets.

Fair Value Accounting.

We follow accounting guidance for our financial investments and liabilities, which defines fair value,
establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures about fair value measurements. We also follow this guidance for our non-financial investments and liabilities.

The
fair value of financial investments and liabilities is determined at each balance sheet date and future declines in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying
investments or new information could affect the recorded values of our investments in marketable securities, private equity funds and other private investments.

We
use derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity costs
and interest rate exposures. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value, netted by counterparty, where the
right of offset exists. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in determining current earnings during the period of the change in fair value.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Warranty.

At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products, parts or services to repair
or replace
products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. Our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the
warranty coverage, the warranty period, historical experience specific to the nature, frequency and average cost to service the claim, along with industry and demographic trends.

Certain
factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors. We believe that
the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals.

A
significant portion of our business is at the consumer retail level through home center retailers and other major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is
a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us. Our revenue recognition policy takes into
account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale.

Insurance Reserves.

We provide for expenses associated with workers' compensation and product liability obligations when such amounts
are probable
and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change that would affect the estimated liability.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date.
Such expense is
recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 5 to 10 years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at age 65.

We
measure compensation expense for stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Such expense is recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock
options, typically five years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at age 65. We utilize the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
options.

Noncontrolling Interest.

We own 68 percent of Hansgrohe SE at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. The aggregate noncontrolling
interest,
net of dividends, at December 31, 2015 and 2014 has been recorded as a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheets.

Interest and Penalties on Uncertain Tax Positions.

We record interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions in income tax expense
(benefit).

Reclassifications.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation in the consolidated financial
statements. In
our consolidated statements of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately classified.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Concluded)

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards
Update 2014-8
("ASU 2014-08"), "Reporting of Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposals of Components of an Entity," which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as
discontinued operations and modifies the related disclosure requirements. We adopted this guidance beginning January 1, 2015. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on
our financial position or our results of operations.

In
November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17 ("ASU 2015-17"), "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which changes the criteria for classifying
deferred tax balances by requiring all deferred taxes be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We retrospectively adopted this guidance on December 31, 2015. As a result of the
retrospective adoption of this standard, current assets decreased by $244 million, non-current assets increased by $219 million and non-current liabilities decreased by
$25 million as of December 31, 2014.

In
May 2014, FASB issued a new standard for revenue recognition, Accounting Standards Codification 606 ("ASC 606"). The purpose of ASC 606 is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability across industries. ASC 606 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our results of operations.

In
February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02 ("ASU 2015-02") "Consolidation (Topic 810) – Amendments to the Consolidations
Analysis," which modifies certain aspects of both the variable interest entities and voting interest entities models. ASU 2015-02 is effective for us for annual periods beginning
January 1, 2016. We do not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations.

In
April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 ("ASU 2015-03") "Interest – Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30) – Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," that requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying value of the debt. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to clarify that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements may remain classified as an
asset. Both ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2016. We do not expect that the adoptions will have a significant impact on
our financial position.

B. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The presentation of discontinued operations includes a component or group of components that we have or intend to dispose of, and represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a
major effect on our operations and financial results. For spin off transactions, discontinued operations treatment is appropriate following the completion of the spin off.

On
September 30, 2014, we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our Installation and Other Services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named
TopBuild Corp. ("TopBuild") through a tax-free distribution of the stock of TopBuild to our stockholders. We initiated
the spin off as TopBuild was no longer considered core to our long-term growth strategy in branded building products. On June 30, 2015, immediately prior to the effective time of the spin off,
TopBuild paid a cash distribution to us of $200 million using the proceeds of its new debt financing arrangement. This transaction was reported as a financing activity in the consolidated
statements of cash flows.

B. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (Continued)

We
have accounted for the spin off of TopBuild as a discontinued operation. (Losses) gains from this discontinued operation were included in (loss) income from discontinued operations,
net, in the consolidated statements of operations.

In
February 2013, we determined that Tvilum, our Danish ready-to-assemble cabinet business, was no longer core to our long-term growth strategy and, accordingly, we embarked on a plan
for disposition. In December 2013, we completed the disposition of this business and a related Danish holding company for net proceeds of $17 million.

We
have accounted for Tvilum as a discontinued operation. Losses from this discontinued operation were included in (loss) income from discontinued operations, net, in the consolidated
statements of operations.

C. ACQUISITIONS

In the second quarter of 2015, we acquired a U.K. window business for approximately $16 million in
cash in the Other Specialty Products segment. This acquisition will support our U.K. window business' growth strategy by expanding its product offerings into timber-alternative windows and doors.

In
the first quarter of 2015, we acquired an aquatic fitness business for approximately $25 million in cash in the Plumbing Products segment. This acquisition will allow our spa
business to expand its wellness products platform, open new channels of distribution and access a new customer base.

In
the first quarter of 2013, we acquired a small U.K. door business in the Other Specialty Products segment. The total net cash purchase price was $4 million.

E. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES

Accounting Policy.

We follow accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
prescribes disclosures
about fair value measurements for financial investments and liabilities. The guidance defines fair value as "the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date." Further, it defines a fair value hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable
or can be corroborated by market data; and Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined
using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

Financial
investments that are available to be traded on readily accessible stock exchanges (domestic or foreign) are considered to have active markets and have been valued using
Level 1 inputs. Financial investments that are not available to be traded on a public market or have limited secondary markets, or contain provisions that limit the ability to sell the
investment are considered to have inactive markets and have been valued using Level 2 or 3 inputs. We incorporated credit risk into the valuations of financial investments by estimating the
likelihood of non-performance by the
counterparty to the applicable transactions. The estimate included the length of time relative to the contract, financial condition of the counterparty and current market conditions. The criteria for
determining if a market was active or inactive were based on the individual facts and circumstances.

Financial Investments.

We have maintained investments in available-for-sale securities, equity method investments, and a number of
private equity
funds and other private investments, principally as part of our tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future tax capital losses.

Auction Rate Securities.

Our investments in available-for-sale securities included cost basis of $19 million and pre-tax
unrealized gains of
$3 million and had a recorded basis of $22 million at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Equity Method Investments.

Investments in private equity fund partnerships, joint ventures and less than majority-owned subsidiaries in
which we have
significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Our consolidated statements of operations include our proportionate share of the net income (loss) of our equity method investees. When
we record our proportionate share of net income (loss), it increases (decreases) our equity income in our consolidated statement of operations and our carrying value of that investment on our
consolidated balance sheet.

During
the fourth quarter of 2014, we sold our investment in the private equity fund, Long Point Capital Fund II L.P. (accounted for as an equity method investment) for proceeds
of $48 million, which approximated net book value. Such proceeds are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows in proceeds from other financial investments, in the investing
activities section.

Private Equity Funds and Other Investments.

Our investments in private equity funds and other private investments, where we do not have
significant
influence, are carried at cost.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

For financial investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period, the
unrealized
gains or losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect, through shareholders' equity, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses and
charges for other-than-temporary impairments are included in determining net income, with related purchase costs based upon specific identification.

In
the past, we invested excess cash in auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or 35 days.
The fair values
of the auction rate securities held by us have been estimated, on a recurring basis, using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). The significant inputs in the discounted cash flow model
used to value the auction rate securities include: expected maturity of auction rate securities, discount rate used to determine the present value of expected cash flows and assumptions for credit
defaults, since the auction rate securities are backed by credit default swap agreements.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

E. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES (Concluded)

There were no changes in the fair value of Level 3 financial investments for the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

It is not practicable for us to estimate the fair value of equity method investments or private
equity funds
and other private investments where we do not have significant influence, because there are no quoted market prices and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation
model to determine the fair value for each fund. Due
to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3 input. These investments are evaluated, on a non-recurring basis, for potential
other-than-temporary impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
investment.

There
were no financial investments measured for impairment on a non-recurring basis during 2015, 2014 or 2013.

We
did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets in 2015 or 2014.

Fair value of debt.

The fair value of our short-term and long-term fixed-rate debt instruments is based principally upon modeled market
prices for
the same or similar issues or the current rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. The aggregate estimated market value of short-term and long-term debt at
December 31, 2015 was approximately $3.6 billion, compared with the aggregate carrying value of $3.4 billion. The aggregate estimated market value of short-term and long-term debt
at December 31, 2014 was approximately $3.7 billion, compared with the aggregate carrying value of $3.4 billion.

F. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We are exposed to global market risk as part of our normal daily business activities. To manage these risks, we enter into various derivative contracts. These contracts include interest
rate swap agreements, foreign currency exchange contracts and contracts intended to hedge our exposure to copper and zinc. We review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk
management on a regular basis.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements.

In 2012, in connection with the issuance of $400 million of debt, we terminated the interest rate
swap hedge
relationships that we had entered into in 2011. These interest



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

F. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued)

rate
swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and effectively fixed interest rates on the forecasted debt issuance to variable rates based on 3-month LIBOR. Upon termination, the ineffective portion
of the cash flow hedges of approximately $2 million loss was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in other, net. The remaining loss of approximately $23 million from
the termination of these swaps is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt, through March 2022. At December 31, 2015, the balance remaining in
accumulated other comprehensive loss was $16 million.

Foreign Currency Contracts.

Our net cash inflows and outflows exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arise
from the sale
of products in countries other than the manufacturing source, foreign currency denominated supplier payments, debt and other payables, and investments in subsidiaries. To mitigate this risk, we,
including certain European operations, entered into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts.

Gains
(losses) related to foreign currency forward and exchange contracts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net. In the event that the
counterparties fail to meet the terms of the foreign currency forward or exchange contracts, our exposure is limited to the aggregate foreign currency rate differential with such institutions.

Metals Contracts.

We have entered into several contracts to manage our exposure to increases in the price of copper and zinc. Gains
(losses) related
to these contracts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in cost of sales.

approximately $2 million and $17 million, included in property and equipment, net, in the consolidated balance sheets, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

During
2014, we decided to sell two facilities in our Cabinets and Related Products segment, and we recorded a charge of $28 million, included in cost of sales in the consolidated
statement of operations, to reflect the estimated fair value of those two facilities. Fair value was estimated using a market approach, considering the estimated fair values for other comparable

We
completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014 and 2013. There was no impairment of goodwill for
any of our reporting units for any of these years.

Other
indefinite-lived intangible assets were $137 million and $130 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and principally included registered
trademarks. In 2015 and 2013, the impairment test indicated there was no impairment of other indefinite-lived intangible assets for any of our business units. In 2014, we recognized an insignificant
impairment charge for other indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result of our 2015 acquisitions, other indefinite lived intangible assets increased by $7 million as of the acquisition
dates.

The
carrying value of our definite-lived intangible assets was $23 million (net of accumulated amortization of $49 million) at December 31, 2015 and
$12 million (net of accumulated amortization of $48 million) at December 31, 2014 and principally included customer relationships with a weighted average amortization period of
6 years in both 2015 and 2014. Amortization expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets of continuing operations was $6 million in 2015 and $4 million in both 2014 and
2013. As a result of our 2015 acquisitions, definite-lived intangible assets increased by $17 million as of the acquisition dates.

At
December 31, 2015, amortization expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets during each of the next five years was as follows: 2016 –
$4 million; 2017 – $2 million; 2018 – $2 million, 2019 – $2 million and
2020 – $2 million.

All
of the notes and debentures above are senior indebtedness and, other than the 6.625% notes due 2018 and the 7.75% notes due 2029, are redeemable at our option.

On
June 15, 2015, we repaid and retired all of our $500 million, 4.8% Notes on the scheduled retirement date.

On
March 24, 2015, we issued $500 million of 4.45% Notes due April 1, 2025.

On
March 28, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of
March 28, 2018. On May 29, 2015 and August 28, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement with the bank group (the "Amended Credit Agreement"). The Amended Credit Agreement reduces the
aggregate commitment to $750 million and extends the maturity date to May 29, 2020. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, at our request and subject to certain conditions, we can increase
the aggregate commitment up to an additional $375 million with the current bank group or new lenders.

The
Amended Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to us and one of our foreign subsidiaries, in U.S. dollars, European euros and certain other
currencies. Borrowings under the revolver denominated in euros are limited to $500 million, equivalent. We can also borrow swingline loans up to $75 million and obtain letters of credit
of up to $100 million; any outstanding letters of credit under the Amended Credit Agreement reduce our borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2015, we had $5 million of outstanding
standby letters of credit.

Revolving
credit loans bear interest under the Amended Credit Agreement, at our option, at (A) a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the
Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.0% (the "Alternative Base Rate"); plus an applicable margin based upon our then-applicable corporate credit ratings; or
(B) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon our then-applicable corporate credit ratings. The foreign currency revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an
applicable margin based upon our then-applicable corporate credit ratings.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

K. DEBT (Concluded)

The Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (A) a maximum net leverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, of 4.0 to 1.0, and (B) a
minimum interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, equal to or greater than 2.5 to 1.0.

In
order for us to borrow under the Amended Credit Agreement, there must not be any default in our covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement (i.e., in addition to the two
financial covenants, principally limitations on subsidiary debt, negative pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and maintenance of properties and insurance) and our representations and
warranties in the Amended Credit Agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a
material adverse change, since December 31, 2014, in each case, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance, and no material tax deficiency). We were in compliance with all covenants and
no borrowings have been made at December 31, 2015.

At
December 31, 2015, the debt maturities during each of the next five years were as follows: 2016 – $1,005 million; 2017 –
$301 million; 2018 – $115 million; 2019 – $1 million and 2020 – $501 million.

Interest
paid was $216 million, $220 million and $232 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

L. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Our 2014 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") replaced the 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan in May 2014 and provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various
forms to employees and non-employee Directors of the Company. At December 31, 2015, outstanding stock-based incentives were in the form of long-term stock awards, stock options, phantom stock
awards and stock appreciation rights.

Pre-tax
compensation expense and the related income tax benefit for these stock-based incentives were as follows, in millions:

At
December 31, 2015, a total of 17.1 million shares of our common stock were available under the 2014 Plan for the granting of stock options and other long-term stock
incentive awards.

Long-Term Stock Awards.

Long-term stock awards are granted to our key employees and non-employee Directors and do not cause net share
dilution
inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares in the open market. We granted 741,040 shares of long-term stock awards during 2015.

Subsequent to the separation of TopBuild, we modified our outstanding equity awards to employees and
non-employee directors such that all individuals received an equivalent fair value both before and after the separation. The modification to the outstanding stock awards was made pursuant to existing
anti-dilution provisions in our 2014 Plan and 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.

At
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there was $42 million, $60 million and $69 million, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense related to
unvested stock awards; such awards had a weighted average remaining vesting period of three years at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

The
total market value (at the vesting date) of stock award shares which vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $54 million, $50 million and $38 million,
respectively.

Stock Options.

Stock options are granted to our key employees. The exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the
grant date.
These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date.

We
granted 452,380 shares of stock options during 2015 with a grant date weighted-average exercise price of approximately $26 per share. During 2015, 3.2 million stock option
shares were forfeited (including options that expired unexercised).

Phantom Stock Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs").

We grant phantom stock awards and SARs to certain non-U.S. employees.

Phantom
stock awards are linked to the value of our common stock on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon vesting, typically over 5 to 10 years. We account for phantom
stock awards as liability-based awards; the compensation expense is initially measured as the market price of our common stock at the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period. The
liability is remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the awards are fully-vested and paid to the employees. We recognized expense of $5 million related to the
valuation of phantom stock awards in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we granted 134,560 shares, 183,530 shares and 165,180 shares, respectively, of phantom stock awards with an aggregate
fair value of $4 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively, and paid $6 million, $5 million and $4 million of cash in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively, to settle phantom stock awards.

L. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Concluded)

SARs are linked to the value of our common stock on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon exercise. We account for SARs using the fair value method, which requires outstanding
SARs to be classified as liability-based awards and valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date; such fair value is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period,
typically five years. The liability is remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the SARs are exercised and payment is made to the employees or the SARs expire. We recognized
expense of $6 million, $1 million and $2 million related to the valuation of SARs for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not grant any SARs.

M. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

We sponsor qualified defined-benefit and defined-contribution retirement plans for most of our employees. In addition to our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, we have unfunded
non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans covering certain employees, which provide for benefits in addition to those provided by the qualified pension plans. Substantially all salaried employees
participate in non-contributory defined-contribution retirement plans, to which payments are determined annually by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

In
addition, we participate in one regional multi-employer pension plan, principally related to building trades, which is not considered significant to us.

Pre-tax
expense related to our retirement plans was as follows, in millions:

For
our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, we have adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures
about fair
value measurements. Accounting guidance defines fair value as "the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date."

Following
is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2015
compared to December 31, 2014.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

M. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)

Common and Preferred Stocks:

Valued at the closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, or based on
the active market for similar securities.

Private Equity and Hedge Funds:

Valued based on an estimated fair value using either a market approach or an income approach, each of
which requires a significant degree of judgment. There is no active trading market for these investments and they are generally illiquid. Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value
measurements used to estimate fair value are a Level 3 input.

Corporate Debt Securities:

Valued based on the active market for similar securities or on estimated fair value.

Government and Other Debt Securities:

Valued based on either the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual
securities are traded, the market for similar securities or estimated fair value based on a model for similar securities.

Common Collective Trust Fund:

Valued based on a unit value basis, which approximates fair value. Such basis is determined by reference to
the respective fund's underlying assets, which are primarily marketable equity and fixed income securities. There are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with this fund.

Short-Term and Other Investments:

Valued based on a net asset value (NAV), which approximates fair value. Such basis is determined by
referencing the respective fund's underlying assets. There are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with these investments.

The
methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could
result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The
discount rate for obligations for 2015 and 2014 was based upon the expected duration of each defined-benefit pension plan's liabilities matched to the December 31, 2015 and
2014 Towers Watson Rate Link Curve. At December 31, 2015, such rates for our defined-benefit pension plans ranged from 2.0 percent to 4.3 percent, with the most significant
portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 4.0 percent or higher. At December 31, 2014, such rates for our defined-benefit pension plans ranged from
2.0 percent to 4.0 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 3.70 percent or higher. The increase in the weighted
average discount rate over the last year is principally the result of higher long-term interest rates in the bond markets.

For
2015 and 2014, we determined the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25 percent based upon an analysis of expected and historical rates of return of various
asset classes utilizing the current and long-term target asset allocation of the plan assets. The projected asset return at both December 31, 2015 and 2014 also considered near term returns,
including current market conditions as well as that pension assets are long-term in nature. The actual annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was negative 1.8 percent in 2015, and
positive 3.6 percent and 13.6 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the 10-year period ended December 31, 2015, the actual annual rate of return on our pension plan assets
was 3.9 percent. Although this rate of return is less than our current expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we note that the 10-year period ended December 31, 2015 includes
one significant decline in the equity markets in 2008 (of negative 32.1 percent). Accordingly, we believe a 7.25 percent expected long-term rate of return is reasonable.

The
investment objectives seek to minimize the volatility of the value of our plan assets relative to pension liabilities and to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay
plan benefits. In 2015, we substantially achieved targeted asset allocation: 50 percent equities, 30 percent fixed-income, and 20 percent alternative
investments (such as private equity, commodities and hedge funds).



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

M. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)

The asset allocation of the investment portfolio was
developed with the objective of achieving our expected rate of return and reducing volatility of
asset returns, and considered the freezing of future benefits. The equity portfolios are invested in individual securities or funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity
securities. The fixed-income portfolio is invested in corporate bonds, bond index funds and U.S. Treasury securities. It is expected that the alternative investments would have a higher rate of return
than the targeted overall long-term return of 7.25 percent. However, these investments are subject to greater volatility, due to their nature, than a portfolio of equities and fixed-income
investments, and would be less liquid than financial instruments that trade on public markets. This portfolio is expected to yield a long-term rate of return of 7.25 percent.

The
fair value of our plan assets is subject to risk including significant concentrations of risk in our plan assets related to equity, interest rate and operating risk. In order to
ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay benefits, a portion of plan assets is allocated to equity investments that are expected, over time, to earn higher returns with more volatility than
fixed-income investments which more closely match pension liabilities. Within equity, risk is mitigated by targeting a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization,
manager mandate size, investment style and process.

In
order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets are allocated to fixed-income investments that are exposed to interest rate risk. Rate
increases generally will result in a decline in fixed-income assets, while reducing the present value of the liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed income assets, partially
offsetting the related increase in the liabilities.

Potential
events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value include the risks of inadequate diversification and other operating risks. To mitigate these
risks, investments are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives. Policies and practices to address operating risks include ongoing manager oversight, plan and
asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers, and periodic compliance and audit reviews to ensure adherence to these policies. In addition, we periodically seek
the input of our independent advisor to ensure the investment policy is appropriate.

Other.

We sponsor certain post-retirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental and life insurance coverage for eligible retirees
and dependents
in the United States based upon age and length of service. The aggregate present value of the unfunded accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was $10 million and $12 million at
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Cash Flows.

At December 31, 2015, we expected to contribute approximately $45 million to our qualified defined-benefit pension
plans in
2016, which will exceed ERISA requirements in 2016. We also expected to pay benefits of $8 million and $12 million to participants of our foreign and non-qualified (domestic)
defined-benefit pension plans, respectively, in 2016.

N. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

On September 30, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in open-market
transactions or otherwise, replacing the previous Board of Directors authorization established in 2007. At December 31, 2015, we have 27.8 million shares remaining under the
authorization.

During
2015, we repurchased and retired 17.2 million shares of our common stock for cash aggregating $456 million (including 741 thousand shares to offset the
dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in 2015). During 2014, we repurchased and retired 6.7 million shares of our common stock for cash aggregating $158 million (including
1.7 million shares to offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in 2014). During 2013, we repurchased and retired 1.7 million shares of our common stock for cash
aggregating $35 million to offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in 2013.

On
June 30, 2015, we completed the spin off of Top Build as an independent publicly traded company. As a result of the separation, our retained earnings decreased by
$828 million in 2015.

On
the basis of amounts paid (declared), cash dividends per common share were $.365 ($.370) in 2015, $.330 ($.345) in 2014 and $.300 ($.300) in 2013.

P. SEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)

Our
operations are principally located in North America and Europe. Our country of domicile is the United States of America.

Corporate
assets consist primarily of real property, equipment, cash and cash investments and other investments.

Our
segments are based upon similarities in products and services and represent the aggregation of operating units, for which financial information is regularly evaluated by our
corporate operating executive in determining resource allocation and assessing performance, and is periodically reviewed by the Board of Directors. Accounting policies for the segments are the same as
those for us. We primarily evaluate performance based upon operating profit (loss) and, other than general corporate expense, allocate specific corporate overhead to each segment. The evaluation of
segment operating profit (loss) also excludes the income from litigation settlements.

S. INCOME TAXES (Continued)

The
tax benefit from certain stock-based compensation is not recognized as a deferred tax asset until the tax deduction reduces cash taxes. During 2015, we recorded a $53 million
deferred tax asset to paid-in capital related to additional net operating losses, previously not recognized, that were used to reduce cash taxes on our 2015 taxable income.

As
a result of recording the separation of TopBuild due to its spin off, as of June 30, 2015, our net deferred tax asset increased by $190 million.

The
current portion of the state and local income tax includes a $5 million, $8 million and $8 million tax benefit from the reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax
positions resulting primarily from the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and favorable settlements on state audits in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The deferred portion of the
state and local taxes includes a $(1) million, $(29) million and $19 million tax (benefit) expense resulting from a change in the valuation allowance against state and local deferred tax assets
in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The deferred portion of the foreign taxes includes $12 million and $(6) million tax expense (benefit) from a change in the valuation allowance against
foreign deferred tax assets in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

During
2015 we recorded a $21 million valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets related to TopBuild as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. The TopBuild deferred
tax assets have been impaired by our decision to spin off TopBuild into a separate company that on a stand-alone basis as of June 30, 2015, the spin off date, will unlikely be able to realize
the value of such deferred tax assets as a result of its history of losses.

Our
capital management strategy includes the repurchase of Masco common stock, the payment of dividends, the pay-down of debt and the funding of potential acquisitions both within and
outside the U.S. In order to provide greater flexibility in the execution of our capital management strategy, we determined in the fourth quarter of 2015 that we may repatriate earnings from certain
foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested. As a result, we recorded a $19 million charge to income tax expense in 2015 to recognize the required taxes on
foreign earnings, including those previously considered permanently reinvested. Our December 31, 2015 deferred tax balance on investment in foreign subsidiaries reflects the impact of all
taxable temporary differences, including those related to substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except those that are legally restricted.

The
accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Possible
sources of taxable
income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future
income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.

If,
based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a
valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company's three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative
evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable, and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the company can place on projected taxable income to support the
recovery of the deferred tax assets.

In
2010, we recorded a $372 million valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. In reaching this conclusion, we
considered the weaker

retail
sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the U.S. housing market which led to U.S. operating losses and significant U.S. goodwill impairment
charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative U.S. loss position.

During
2012 and 2011, objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as U.S. operating losses and significant impairment charges for U.S. goodwill and other intangible assets,
continued to outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance. As a result, we recorded increases of $65 million and $87 million in the valuation allowance related
to our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

In
the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal and certain state deferred tax assets due
primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our U.S. operations. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and
remodel activity in the U.S. and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our U.S. operations
over the past few years.

In
the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an additional $12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain U.K. and Mexican deferred tax assets
primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions.

We
continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize
our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made.

Of
the $94 million and $238 million deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2015 and December 31,
2014, $67 million and $233 million will expire between 2021 and 2033 and $27 million and $5 million are unlimited, respectively.

If
recognized, $28 million and $26 million of the liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, net of any U.S. Federal tax
benefit, would impact our effective tax rate.

Of
the $53 million and $48 million total liability for uncertain tax positions (including related interest and penalties) at December 31, 2015 and 2014,
$52 million and $48 million are recorded in other liabilities, respectively, and $1 million is recorded as a net offset to other assets at December 31, 2015.

We
file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. We continue to participate in the Compliance Assurance Program ("CAP").
CAP is a real-time audit of the U.S. Federal income tax return that allows the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), working in conjunction with us, to determine tax return compliance with the U.S.
Federal tax law prior to filing the return. This program provides us with greater certainty about our tax liability for a given year within months, rather than years, of filing our annual tax return
and greatly reduces the need for recording a liability for U.S. Federal uncertain tax positions. The IRS has completed their examination of our consolidated U.S. Federal tax returns through 2014. With
few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state or foreign income tax examinations on filed returns for years before 2005.

As
a result of tax audit closings, settlements and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions within the next 12 months, we anticipate that it
is reasonably possible the liability for uncertain tax positions could be reduced by approximately $8 million.

We
follow accounting guidance regarding determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This accounting guidance clarifies that
share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends prior to vesting should be considered participating securities. We have granted restricted stock awards that
contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends on unvested shares; such unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities. As participating securities, the unvested shares are
required to be included in the calculation of our basic earnings per common share, using the "two-class method." The two-class method of computing earnings per common share is an allocation method
that calculates earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we allocated dividends and undistributed earnings to the participating securities.

Additionally,
5 million common shares, 7 million common shares and 12 million common shares for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to stock options were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share due to their antidilutive effect.

Common
shares outstanding included on our balance sheet and for the calculation of earnings per common share do not include unvested stock awards (5 million common shares and
6 million common shares at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively); shares outstanding for legal requirements included all common shares that have voting rights (including unvested
stock awards).

Litigation.

We are subject to claims, charges, litigation and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including those
arising from
or related to contractual matters, intellectual property, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, product recalls, construction defect, insurance coverage, personnel and employment
disputes, anti-trust issues and other matters, including class actions. We believe we have adequate defenses in these matters and that the likelihood that the outcome of these matters would have a
material adverse effect on us is remote. However, there is no assurance that we will prevail in these matters, and we could, in the future, incur judgments, enter into settlements of claims or revise
our expectations regarding the outcome of these matters, which could materially impact our results of operations.

Investments.

With respect to our investments in private equity funds, we had, at December 31, 2015, commitments to contribute up
to
$6 million of additional capital to such funds representing our aggregate capital commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. We are contractually obligated to make
additional capital contributions to certain of our private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. We have no control over when or if the capital calls will occur.
Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our investment in the private equity fund when paid.

Other Matters.

We enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in
which we
operate. Such indemnifications include customer claims against builders for issues relating to our products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, we occasionally
provide reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset
valuations. We have never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications and we evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately record an estimated liability
when probable.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The
Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on an evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

b.

Management's
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Management's
report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is included in this Report under
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under the heading, "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" and is incorporated herein by reference. The report of
our independent registered public accounting firm is also included under Item 8, under the heading, "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" and is incorporated herein by
reference.

c.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

In
connection with the evaluation of the Company's "internal control over financial reporting" that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, which is required under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 by paragraph (d) of Exchange Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 (as defined in paragraph (f) of Rule 13a-15), management determined that there was no change that
materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.

During
the first quarter of 2016, we started a phased deployment of a new Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system at Milgard. The system implementation is designed, in part, to enhance the overall
system of internal control over financial reporting through further automation and improve business processes and is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. However, this system implementation is significant in scale and complexity and will result in modification to certain Milgard internal controls.
