PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Masco Corporation manufactures, distributes and installs home
    improvement and building products, with emphasis on brand-name
    consumer products and services holding leadership positions in
    their markets. We are among the largest manufacturers in North
    America of a number of home improvement and building products,
    including faucets, cabinets, architectural coatings and windows
    and we are one of the largest installers of insulation for the
    new home construction market. We generally provide broad product
    offerings in a variety of styles and price points and distribute
    products through multiple channels, including directly to
    homebuilders and wholesale and retail channels. Approximately
    79 percent of our 2009 sales were generated by our North
    American operations.

Over the past three years, we have experienced a significant
    downturn in the home improvement and new home construction
    markets. As a result, we have been focused on the strategic
    rationalization of our businesses, including business
    consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system
    implementations and other cost savings initiatives. Throughout
    our businesses, we have closed several plants and since 2006, we
    have closed over 90 locations formerly operated by our
    Installation and Other Services segment.

We continue to focus on our cost structure and we are driving
    process improvement through the implementation of the Masco
    Business System (“MBS”). The MBS is the integrated
    leadership practices, processes, tools and capabilities that
    enable the effective and consistent execution of our strategies
    and operating plans to maximize our full potential. Through the
    MBS, we are advancing our strategy of growing organic sales
    based on a better understanding of our customer needs and
    investing in new product innovation. We are also focusing on
    enhancing customer experience through improvements in product
    quality. In 2009, we introduced several new products, including
    BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA
    INTERIOR

®

paint and the
    SIMPLICITY

tm

window by Milgard, and we expanded the
    DIAMOND

tm

Seal Technology faucets offered by Delta. We have also begun
    several new initiatives, including programs related to retro-fit
    home energy efficiency services, the sale of
    BEHR

®

paint to professional painters through The Home Depot and the
    combination of our North American cabinet business units to form
    Masco Cabinetry.



We report our financial results in five business segments
    aggregated by similarity in products and services. The following
    table sets forth, for the three years ended December 31,
    2009, the contribution of our segments to net sales and
    operating profit. Additional financial information concerning
    our operations by segment and by geographic regions, as well as
    general corporate expense, net, as of and for the three years
    ended December 31, 2009, is set forth in Note O to our
    consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of
    this Report.

Cabinets
    and Related Products

In North America, we manufacture and sell economy, stock,
    semi-custom, assembled and

ready-to-assemble

cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home
    entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price
    points. In Europe, we manufacture and sell assembled and

ready-to-assemble

kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home entertainment
    cabinetry. These products are primarily sold in the United
    States and in Europe under a number of trademarks including
    KRAFTMAID

®

,

    DISTINCTIONS

®

,

    TVILUM-SCANBIRK

tm

and
    WOODGATE

®

primarily to dealers and home centers, and under the brands
    MERILLAT

®

,

    MOORES

tm

and QUALITY
    CABINETS

®

primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the home
    improvement and new home construction markets. Cabinet sales are
    significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home
    construction and retail consumer spending, particularly spending
    for major home



improvement products. A significant portion of our sales for the
    home improvement market is made through home center retailers.

Over the past several years, this segment of our business has
    been particularly affected by the downturn in the home
    improvement and new home construction markets due to new
    homebuilders producing smaller homes with smaller kitchens and
    end-consumers shifting to lower price point products. In 2009,
    we closed several manufacturing plants in this segment. We are
    currently focused on improving cabinet production efficiencies
    at lower volumes while maintaining our ability to respond
    effectively to increased demand when the home improvement and
    new home construction markets improve. By the end of 2010, we
    expect that we will be able to manufacture a common base cabinet
    at all of our plants that principally manufacture cabinets for
    the new home construction market in North America. We have also
    expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the
    manufacture and sale of countertops in North America.

The cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States and
    Europe is highly competitive, with several large competitors and
    numerous local and regional competitors. In addition to price,
    we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on
    product quality, responsiveness to customer needs, product
    features and selection. Significant North American competitors
    include American Woodmark Corporation and Fortune Brands, Inc.

In February 2010, we announced the combination of our Builder
    Cabinet Group and Retail Cabinet Group to form Masco
    Cabinetry. We believe that the creation of Masco Cabinetry will
    help us establish an even stronger position to lead the cabinet
    category within the repair and remodel and new home construction
    markets. Masco Cabinetry will focus on all channels of
    distribution by offering a broad portfolio of cabinets and
    countertops at a wide range of price points and in a variety of
    styles.

Plumbing
    Products

Our plumbing products segment sells a wide variety of faucet and
    showering devices that are manufactured by or for us. Our
    plumbing products are sold in North America and Europe under
    various brand names including
    DELTA

®

,

    PEERLESS

®

,

    HANSGROHE

®

,

    AXOR

    NEWPORT
    BRASS

®

,

    ALSONS

®

    SIRRUS

and PLUMB

.

    Products include single-handle and double-handle faucets,
    showerheads, handheld showers and valves, which are sold to
    major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors who
    sell these products to plumbers, building contractors,
    remodelers, smaller retailers and others.

We believe that our products in this segment are among the
    leaders in sales in the North American and European markets,
    with American Standard, Kohler, Moen and Price Pfister as major
    brand competitors. We also have several European competitors,
    primarily in Germany, including Friedrich Grohe. We face
    significant competition from private label products (including
    house brands sold by certain of our customers). Many of the
    faucet and showering products with which our products compete
    are manufactured in Asia. The businesses in our Plumbing
    Products segment source products from Asia and manufacture
    products in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

Other plumbing products manufactured and sold by us include AQUA
    GLASS

®

,

    MIROLIN

®

and AMERICAN SHOWER &
    BATH

tm

acrylic and gelcoat bath and shower enclosure units, shower
    trays and laundry tubs, which are sold primarily to wholesale
    plumbing distributors and home center retailers for the North
    American home improvement and new home construction markets. Our
    spas are manufactured and sold under HOT
    SPRING

®

,

    CALDERA

®

and other trademarks directly to independent dealers. Major
    competitors include Kohler, Lasco, Maax and Jacuzzi. We sell
    HÜPPE

®

shower enclosures through wholesale channels primarily in
    western Europe.
    HERITAGE

tm

ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally
    sold in the United Kingdom directly to selected retailers.

Also included in the Plumbing Products segment are brass and
    copper plumbing system components and other plumbing
    specialties, which are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware
    wholesalers and to home center retailers, hardware stores,
    building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These
    products are



marketed in North America for the wholesale trade under the
    BRASSCRAFT

®

and BRASSTECH trademarks and for the “do-it-yourself”
    market under the MASTER
    PLUMBER

®

and PLUMB SHOP trademarks and are also sold under private label.

In addition to price, we believe that competition in our
    Plumbing Products markets is based largely on brand reputation,
    product quality, product innovation and features, and breadth of
    product offering.

A substantial portion of our plumbing products are made from
    brass, the major components of which are copper and zinc. From
    time to time, we have encountered volatility in the price of
    brass. In the past, we have implemented a hedging strategy to
    attempt to minimize the impact of commodity price volatility; a
    hedging strategy may be implemented in the future. Legislation
    enacted in California and Vermont, which became effective in
    January 2010, mandates new standards for acceptable lead content
    in plumbing products sold in those states. Similar legislation
    may be considered by other states. Faucet and water supply valve
    manufacturers, including our plumbing product companies, will be
    required to obtain adequate supplies of lead-free brass or
    suitable alternative materials for continued production of
    faucets.

In 2008, our Delta Faucet business introduced a new water
    delivery system known as DIAMOND Seal Technology. DIAMOND Seal
    Technology reduces the number of potential leak points in a
    faucet, simplifies installation and satisfies the legislation
    enacted in California and Vermont regulating the acceptable lead
    content in plumbing products. Delta Faucet, in the near-term,
    plans to incorporate DIAMOND Seal Technology into its
    domestically manufactured single-handle faucets and, in the
    future, plans to expand the application of the technology to
    most other Delta faucets. The success of DIAMOND Seal Technology
    depends on many factors, including the performance of the
    technology and the market’s acceptance of the technology as
    well as Delta’s ability to integrate successfully the
    technology into its most popular faucets.

Installation
    and Other Services

Our Installation and Other Services segment sells installed
    building products and distributes building products primarily to
    the new home construction market, and to a lesser extent, the
    commercial construction market, throughout the United States. In
    order to respond to the significant decrease in demand in the
    new home construction industry over the past three years, we
    have implemented several cost savings initiatives involving the
    consolidation and closure of over 90 branch locations. This
    rationalization has been accomplished while maintaining our
    strategic presence in most of the top 100 Metropolitan
    Statistical Areas (“MSA”) in the United States. In
    addition, over the past two years, in this segment, we have
    de-emphasized the installation of certain non-insulation
    building products that are not core to our service offering,
    including windows and paint. In addition to insulation, our
    current offering of installed building products primarily
    consists of gutters, after-paint products, framing components,
    fireplaces, garage doors and cabinets. The installation and
    distribution of insulation comprised approximately nine percent,
    11 percent and 12 percent of our consolidated net
    sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Installed building products are supplied primarily
    to custom and production homebuilders by our network of branches
    located in most MSA’s throughout the United States.
    Distributed products include insulation, insulation accessories,
    gutters, roofing and fireplaces. Distributed products are sold
    primarily to contractors and dealers from distribution centers
    in various parts of the United States.

Within this segment, we have also begun several new initiatives
    related to improved energy efficiency, including energy audit
    services and related home improvements targeted at the retrofit
    and remodeling markets.

In addition to price, we believe that competition in this
    industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of
    installation service. We believe that we are the largest
    national provider of installed insulation in the new home
    construction industry in the United States. Our competitors
    include several regional contractors, as well as numerous local
    contractors and lumber yards. We believe that our financial
    resources are substantial compared to regional and local
    contractors.



Decorative
    Architectural Products

We produce architectural coatings including paints, primers,
    specialty paint products, stains, varnishes and waterproofing
    products. The products are sold in the United States, Canada,
    China, Mexico and South America under the brand names
    BEHR

®

,

    KILZ

®

,

    CASUAL
    COLORS

®

and
    EXPRESSIONS

®

to the “do-it-yourself” and professional markets
    through home centers, paint stores and other retailers. Net
    sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately
    20 percent, 15 percent and 13 percent of our
    consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Competitors in the
    architectural coatings market include large national and
    international brands such as Benjamin Moore, Glidden, Olympic,
    Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Zinsser, as well as many regional
    and other national brands. In addition to price, we believe that
    competition in this industry is based largely on product
    quality, technology and product innovation, customer service and
    brand reputation.

Our BEHR brand is sold through The Home Depot, the
    segment’s and our largest customer. The paint departments
    at The Home Depot stores include the Behr color center and
    computer kiosk with the COLOR SMART BY
    BEHR

®

computerized color-matching system that enables consumers to
    select and coordinate their paint-color selection. In 2009,
    Behr’s product offering was enhanced by the introduction of
    the BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA INTERIOR paint, which is a
    high-quality, low volatile organic compound, interior paint and
    primer in one. The loss of this segment’s sales to The Home
    Depot would have a material adverse effect on this
    segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a
    whole.

Titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of
    paint. Shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium
    dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand
    and from production capacity limitations. Petroleum products are
    also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings.
    Significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas
    lead to higher raw material costs (e.g., for resins, solvents
    and packaging, as well as titanium dioxide), which can adversely
    affect the segment’s results of operations.

Our Decorative Architectural Products segment also includes
    LIBERTY

®

cabinet, door, window and other hardware, which is manufactured
    for us and sold to home centers, other retailers, original
    equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets. Key competitors
    in North America include Amerock, Belwith, Umbra and Stanley.
    Decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under
    the brand names FRANKLIN
    BRASS

®

and DECOR
    BATHWARE

®

to distributors, home center retailers and other retailers.
    Competitors include Moen and Globe Union.

Other
    Specialty Products

We manufacture and sell vinyl, fiberglass and aluminum windows
    and patio doors under the
    MILGARD

®

brand name to the home improvement and new home construction
    markets, principally in the western United States. MILGARD
    products are sold primarily through dealers and, to a lesser
    extent, directly to production homebuilders and through lumber
    yards and home center retailers. In 2009, Milgard expanded its
    product line with the introduction of the SIMPLICITY Window,
    which is an energy-efficient vinyl window targeted to
    value-conscious customers. This segment’s competitors in
    North America include national brands, such as Jeld-Wen,
    Simonton, Pella and Andersen, and numerous regional brands. In
    the United Kingdom, we manufacture and sell windows, related
    products and components under several brand names including
    GRIFFIN

tm

,

    CAMBRIAN

tm

,

    PREMIER

tm

and
    DURAFLEX

tm

.

    Sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the
    repair and remodeling markets, although our Duraflex business is
    also a supplier to other window fabricators. United Kingdom
    competitors include many small and mid-sized firms and a few
    large, vertically integrated competitors. In addition to price,
    we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on
    customer service and product quality.

We manufacture and sell a complete line of manual and electric
    staple gun tackers, staples and other fastening tools under the
    brand names
    ARROW

®

and
    POWERSHOT

®

.

    We sell these products through various distribution channels
    including home centers and other retailers and wholesalers. Our
    principal North American competitor in this product line is
    Stanley.



Additional
    Information

•

We hold United States and foreign patents, patent applications,
    licenses, trademarks and trade names. As a manufacturer and
    distributor of brand name products, we view our trademarks and
    other proprietary rights as important, but do not believe that
    there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of such rights that
    would have a material adverse effect on our present business as
    a whole.

•

All of our operating segments, except the Plumbing Products
    segment, normally experience stronger sales during the second
    and third calendar quarters, corresponding with the peak season
    for new home construction and remodeling.

•

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. In addition to responsibilities
    relating to environmental remediation, our businesses are
    subject to other requirements regarding protection of the
    environment and worker health and safety. Our businesses are
    subject to requirements relating to the emission of volatile
    organic compounds which may impact our sourcing of
    particleboard, require that we install special equipment in
    manufacturing facilities or that we reformulate paint products.
    Our Plumbing Products segment is subject to restrictions on lead
    content in some of its products. Compliance with such laws and
    regulations could significantly affect product performance as
    well as our production costs. We monitor applicable laws and
    regulations relating to the protection of the environment and
    worker health and safety, and incur ongoing expense relating to
    compliance. Compliance with the federal, state and local
    regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the
    environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
    environment and worker health and safety, is not expected to
    result in material capital expenditures or to have a material
    adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position.

•

We do not consider backlog orders to be material.

•

At December 31, 2009, we employed approximately
    35,400 people. Satisfactory relations have generally
    prevailed between us and our employees.

Item 1A. Risk
    Factors.

There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that have
    affected and may continue to affect our business. These risks
    and uncertainties have negatively impacted our current results
    and could cause our future results to differ from past
    performance or expected results, including results described in
    statements elsewhere in this Report that constitute
    “forward-looking statements” under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The effect on us of
    certain of these risk factors is discussed below under
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Additional
    risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we
    currently believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.
    These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to,
    the following, which we consider to be most relevant to our
    specific business activities.



A
    significant portion of our business relies on home improvement
    and new home construction activity levels, both of which have
    experienced a significant downturn.

A significant portion of our business relies on home improvement
    (including repair and remodeling) and new home construction
    activity levels, principally in North America and Europe. The
    new home construction market, which is cyclical in nature, has
    undergone a significant downturn marked by declines in the
    demand for new homes, an oversupply of new and existing homes on
    the market and a reduction in the availability of financing for
    homebuyers. The oversupply of existing homes held for sale has
    been exacerbated by a growing number of home mortgage
    foreclosures, which has contributed to the downward pressure on
    home prices.

Unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction,
    this economic decline has also adversely affected our home
    improvement businesses. Low levels of consumer confidence and
    the downward pressure on home prices have made it much more
    difficult for homeowners to make additional investments in their
    homes, such as kitchen and bath remodeling projects. Further,
    disruptions in the credit markets have limited the ability of
    consumers to finance home improvements.

We believe that, during the third and fourth quarters of 2009,
    there have been some signs of stabilization in our markets and
    we continue to believe that the long-term outlook for the home
    improvement and new home construction markets is favorable.
    However, we cannot predict the type, timing or strength of a
    recovery in our markets. Depressed activity levels in consumer
    spending for home improvements and new home construction have
    adversely affected our results of operations and our financial
    position.

Furthermore, the economic turmoil has caused certain shifts in
    consumer preferences and purchasing practices and has resulted
    in changes in the business models and strategies of our
    customers. Such shifts, which may or may not be long-term, have
    altered the nature and prices of products demanded by the
    end-consumer and our customers. If we do not timely and
    effectively respond to these changing consumer preferences, our
    relationships with our customers could be adversely affected,
    the demand for our products could be reduced and our market
    share could be negatively affected.

A
    prolonged economic downturn could reduce our financial resources
    and flexibility.

The valuation of assets on our balance sheet, particularly
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, is
    largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance
    of our businesses. A further decline in the expectation of our
    future performance or a continuation of the adverse conditions
    in the new home construction markets may cause us to recognize
    non-cash impairment charges, which are not determinable at this
    time, for certain long-lived assets, including goodwill, and
    could result in a reduction in our shareholders’ equity in
    the future. Such a reduction in our shareholders’ equity
    may limit our borrowing capacity under our existing Five-Year
    Revolving Credit Agreement.

We rely
    on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between
    our distribution channels.

The size and importance of individual customers to our
    businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution
    channels have consolidated or exited the business. Larger
    customers can make significant changes in their volume of
    purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we
    receive for our products and services, our costs of doing
    business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do
    business. Sales of our home improvement and building products to
    home center retailers are substantial. In 2009, sales to our
    largest customer, The Home Depot, were $2.1 billion
    (approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales).
    Lowe’s is our second largest customer. In 2009, our sales
    to Lowe’s were less than 10 percent of our
    consolidated net sales. Although homebuilders, dealers and other
    retailers represent other channels of distribution for our
    products and services, the loss of a substantial portion of our
    sales to The Home Depot or the loss of our sales to Lowe’s
    would have a material adverse effect on our business.

As some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted
    customers, conflicts between our existing distribution channels
    have occurred, and will continue to occur. In addition, we may
    undermine the



business relationships we have with customers who purchase our
    products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase
    the amount of business we transact directly with our larger
    customers. In addition, our large retail customers are
    increasingly requesting product exclusivity, which may affect
    the products we can offer to other customers.

Our
    principal markets are highly competitive.

The major geographic markets for our products and services are
    highly competitive and, in recent years, competition has
    intensified significantly. Competition is further intensified
    during economic downturns. Home center retailers are increasing
    their purchases of products directly from manufacturers,
    particularly low-cost suppliers in Asia, for sale as private
    label and house brand merchandise. Also, home center retailers,
    which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on
    retail consumers and remodelers, are increasingly turning their
    marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and
    installers. We believe that competition in our industries is
    based largely on price, product and service quality, brand
    reputation, customer service and product features and
    innovation. Although the relative importance of such factors
    varies among customers and product categories, price is often a
    primary factor.

In addition to the challenges we have faced as a result of the
    economic downturn in our markets, our ability to maintain our
    competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses
    depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our
    relationships with major customers, implementing growth
    strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic
    markets, capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names,
    managing our cost structure, accommodating shorter life-cycles
    for our products and product development and innovation.

The cost
    and availability of materials and the performance of our supply
    chain affect our operating results.

It has been, and likely will continue to be, difficult for us to
    pass on to customers cost increases for commodities or other
    materials that are major components of our products or services.
    In addition, we may incur substantial costs as part of our
    strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain
    commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase
    supplies at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices.
    Delays in adjusting, or in our inability to adjust, selling
    prices may be due to factors such as our existing arrangements
    with customers, competitive considerations and customer
    resistance to price increases. Further, when commodity prices
    decline, we receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices
    for our products and services. Changes in energy costs and
    certain commodities not only impact our production costs, but
    also the cost to transport our products.

We manufacture products in Asia and source products and
    components from third parties in Asia. The distances involved in
    these arrangements, together with differences in business
    practices, shipping and delivery requirements, the limited
    number of suppliers, and laws and regulations, have increased
    the difficulty of managing our supply chain, the complexity of
    our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions
    in our production scheduling.

We rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain
    of our products or key components. If there is an interruption
    in these sources of supply, we may experience difficulty or
    delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be
    disrupted.

International
    political, monetary, economic and social developments affect our
    business.

Over 21 percent of our sales are derived outside of North
    America (principally in Europe) and are transacted in currencies
    other than U.S. dollars (principally European euros and
    Great Britain pounds). In addition, we manufacture products in
    Asia and source products and components from third parties in
    Asia. Our international business faces risks associated with
    changes in political, monetary, economic and social
    environments, labor conditions and practices, the laws,
    regulations and policies of foreign governments, cultural
    differences and differences in enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights. U.S. laws affecting
    activities of U.S. companies doing business abroad,
    including tax laws and laws regulating various



business practices, also impact our international business. Our
    international operating results may be influenced, when compared
    to our North American results, in part due to relative economic
    conditions in the European markets and due to competitive
    pricing pressures on certain products. The financial reporting
    of our consolidated operating results is affected by
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may present
    challenges in comparing operating performance from period to
    period and in forecasting future performance.

We have
    financial commitments and investments in financial assets,
    including assets that are not readily marketable and involve
    financial risk.

We have maintained investments in

available-for-sale

securities (including marketable and auction rate securities)
    and a number of private equity funds, although we are reducing
    such investments. Since there is no active trading market for
    investments in private equity funds, they are for the most part
    illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also have a
    relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial
    leverage, than other financial investments. Future changes in
    market conditions, the future performance of the underlying
    investments or new information provided by private equity fund
    managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or
    the amounts realized upon liquidation. In addition, we have
    commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to
    these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from
    the private equity fund. The decline in economic conditions in
    2008 resulted in the decline in the value of our investments in
    debt and equity securities, including assets held in our pension
    plans. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of such
    investments and assets remains at reduced levels.

Claims
    and litigation could be costly.

We are, from time to time, involved in various claims,
    litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the
    ordinary course of our business and which could have a material
    adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract
    disputes, personal injury claims, warranty disputes,
    environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims,
    employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation,
    including class actions.

In recent years, we have experienced class action lawsuits
    predicated upon claims for antitrust violations, product
    liability and wage and hour issues. We have generally denied
    liability and have vigorously defended these cases. Due to their
    scope and complexity, however, such lawsuits are particularly
    costly to resolve and significant exposures have been alleged.

We are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and direct
    claims for product liability that can result in significant
    liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly
    to defend. Also, we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to
    provide us with products or components for products that we
    sell. As a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality
    of products or components sourced from other manufacturers, we
    are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products
    and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.

Increasingly, homebuilders, including our customers, are subject
    to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary
    course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with
    these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify
    them against liability for the performance of our products or
    services or the performance of other products that we install.
    These claims, often asserted several years after completion of
    construction, frequently result in lawsuits against the
    homebuilders and many of their subcontractors, including us, and
    require us to incur defense costs even when our products or
    services are not the principal basis for the claims.

Although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters
    vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims
    and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or
    effect of any claim or litigation matter, and there can be no
    assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks
    of loss resulting from claims and litigation. We may elect not
    to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available
    insurance is excessive relative to the



risks presented. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be
    adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If
    any significant accident, judgment, claim or other event is not
    fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material
    adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

See Note S to the consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 of this Report for additional
    information about litigation involving our businesses.

Government
    and industry responses to environmental and health and safety
    concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating
    results.

Government regulations pertaining to health and safety
    (including protection of employees as well as consumers) and
    environmental concerns continue to emerge, domestically as well
    as internationally. In addition to having to comply with current
    requirements (including requirements that do not become
    effective until a future date), even more stringent requirements
    could be imposed on our industries in the future. Compliance
    with these regulations (such as the restrictions on lead content
    in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and
    formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our
    businesses) may require us to alter our manufacturing and
    installation processes and our sourcing. Such actions could
    adversely impact our operating results, and our ability to
    effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely
    impact our competitive position.

The
    long-term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to
    attract, develop and retain talented management.

To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain highly
    qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing
    and product design and innovation and, as we consider entering
    new international markets, skilled personnel familiar with these
    markets. We compete with multinational firms for these employees
    and we invest significant resources in recruiting, developing,
    motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop,
    motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our
    competitive position and our operating results.

On February 10, 2010, there were approximately 5,700
    holders of record of the Company’s common stock.

We expect that our practice of paying quarterly dividends on our
    common stock will continue, although the payment of future
    dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and
    will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial
    condition and other factors. In 2009, we reduced the quarterly
    dividend from $.235 per common share to its current level of
    $.075 per common share.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The financial and business analysis below provides information
    which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding
    of our consolidated financial position, results of operations
    and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be
    read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
    and related notes.

The following discussion and certain other sections of this
    Report contain statements reflecting our views about our future
    performance and constitute “forward-looking
    statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
    Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that
    are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual results
    may differ materially from the results discussed in such
    forward-looking statements. Readers should consider that various
    factors, including those discussed in Item 1A “Risk
    Factors” of this Report, the “Executive
    Level Overview,” “Critical Accounting Policies
    and Estimates” and “Outlook for the Company”
    sections, may affect our performance. We undertake no obligation
    to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of
    new information, future events or otherwise.

Executive
    Level Overview

We manufacture, distribute and install home improvement and
    building products. These products are sold to the home
    improvement and new home construction markets through mass
    merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, homebuilders,
    distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors.

During 2009, we experienced a decline in our markets, including
    a decline in new home construction of over 38 percent from
    2008, as well as a decline in consumer spending for home
    improvement products. Net sales decreased 18 percent in
    2009 from 2008, and operating profit (as adjusted to exclude
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets,
    general corporate expense, net, charge for defined-benefit plan
    curtailment, charge for litigation settlements, accelerated
    stock compensation expense and (loss) gain on corporate fixed
    assets, net — see Footnote O of the consolidated
    financial statements) declined to 6.2 percent of sales in
    2009 from 7.5 percent of sales in 2008.

Factors that affect our results of operations include the levels
    of home improvement activity and new home construction
    principally in North America and Europe, the importance of our
    relationships with key customers (including The Home Depot,
    which represented approximately 26 percent of net sales in
    2009), our ability to maintain our leadership positions in our
    U.S. and global markets in the face of increasing
    competition and our ability to effectively manage our overall
    cost structure, including the cost and availability of
    materials. Our International businesses face political,
    monetary, economic and other risks that vary from country to
    country, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
    Further, we have financial commitments and investments in
    financial assets that are not readily marketable and that
    involve financial risk. In addition, litigation could be costly.
    These and other factors are discussed in more detail in
    Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Report.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date
    of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review
    our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical
    experience, as well as current economic conditions and various
    other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.



We believe that the following critical accounting policies are
    affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition and Receivables

We recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is
    transferred to customers or when services are rendered. We
    record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon
    estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other
    Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables. We
    record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and
    incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative
    advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based
    incentives. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts
    receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
    customers to make required payments. In addition, we monitor our
    customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our
    customers on an on-going basis. During downturns in our markets,
    declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of
    customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and
    we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer
    defaults. Our bad debt expense was $34 million,
    $41 million and $29 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In North America, we manufacture products (principally windows,
    doors and cabinets) and provide installation of insulation and
    other products and services to homebuilders. Our bad debt
    expense related to homebuilders was $22 million,
    $28 million and $23 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Inventories

We record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value, with expense estimates made for obsolescence or
    unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the
    recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value
    based upon assumptions about future demand and market
    conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor these estimates and
    record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual
    experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly
    deviated from those determined using these estimates.

Financial
    Investments

On January 1, 2008, we adopted accounting guidance that
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for
    our financial investments and liabilities. This guidance defines
    fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date.”
    Further, it defines a fair value hierarchy for measurement and
    disclosure of the fair value for financial instruments, as
    follows: Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs as
    observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted
    market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs
    that are observable or can be corroborated by market data; and
    Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by
    little or no market activity and that are financial instruments
    whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments
    for which the determination of fair value requires significant
    management judgment or estimation.

We have maintained investments in

available-for-sale

securities and a number of private equity funds, which
    aggregated $110 million and $123 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2009. We record investments
    in

available-for-sale

securities at fair value, and unrealized gains or losses (that
    are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect,
    through shareholders’ equity, as a component of other
    comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet. We
    estimated the fair value of investments in

available-for-sale

securities using primarily Level 1 inputs. We estimated the
    fair value of our investment in Asahi Tec preferred stock using
    a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). If we changed
    the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by
    100 basis points, the value of the Asahi Tec preferred
    stock would change by approximately three percent.



In the past, we have invested excess cash in auction rate
    securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities
    that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or
    35 days. At December 31, 2009, our investment in
    auction rate securities was $22 million; we have not
    increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007.
    The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated based on
    a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). If we changed
    the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by
    75 basis points, the value of the auction rate securities
    would change by approximately $1 million.

We carry our investments in private equity funds at cost. It is
    not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private
    equity funds because there are no quoted market prices, and
    sufficient information is not readily available for us to
    utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each
    fund. These investments are evaluated, on a non-recurring basis,
    for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an
    event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.
    Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value
    measurements used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3
    input.

Impairment indicators we consider include the following: whether
    there has been a significant deterioration in earnings
    performance, asset quality or business prospects; a significant
    adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological
    environment; a significant adverse change in the general market
    condition or geographic area in which the investment operates;
    industry and sector performance; current equity and credit
    market conditions; and any bona fide offers to purchase the
    investment for less than the carrying value. We also consider
    specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of
    and business outlook for the fund, including industry and sector
    performance. The significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a
    fund for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment include current economic conditions, market analysis
    for specific funds and performance indicators in the automotive
    and transportation, residential and commercial construction,
    bio-technology, health care and information technology sectors
    in which the applicable funds’ investments operate.

At December 31, 2009, we have investments in 17 venture
    capital funds, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $28 million. The venture capital funds invest in

start-up

or
    smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the
    information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors.
    At December 31, 2009, we also have investments in 28 buyout
    funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $95 million. The
    buyout funds invest in later-stage, established businesses and,
    other than the Heartland Industrial Partners Fund, which is
    primarily in the automotive and transportation sector, no buyout
    fund has a concentration in a particular sector.

Since there is no active trading market for these investments,
    they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their
    nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business
    risk, including financial leverage, than other financial
    investments. The timing of distributions from the funds, which
    depends on particular events related to the underlying
    investments, as well as the funds’ schedules for making
    distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to
    predict. As a result, the amount of income we record from these
    investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter.
    Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of
    the underlying investments or new information provided by
    private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of
    these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation.

We record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment
    has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be

other-than-temporary.

During 2009, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
    of $10 million related to our investment in five private
    equity funds.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net
    tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other
    identifiable intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of each
    year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more
    likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
    its carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of
    goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. We selected
    the discounted cash flow methodology as we believe that it is
    comparable to what would be used by other market participants.
    We have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment
    testing of



goodwill at the operating segment level, as defined by
    accounting guidance. Our operating segments are reporting units
    that engage in business activities, for which discrete financial
    information, including five-year forecasts, are available.

Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method
    requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions,
    including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions
    and appropriate discount rates. Our judgments are based upon
    historical experience, current market trends, consultations with
    external valuation specialists and other information. While we
    believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the
    valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and
    assumptions could result in different outcomes. In estimating
    future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year
    forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital
    expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term
    assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the
    five-year forecast. We generally develop these forecasts based
    upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing
    products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated
    housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing
    homes.

In 2009, for our reporting units that primarily sell to the new
    home construction market (including those in the Installation
    and Other Services segment), we utilized estimated housing
    starts, from independent industry sources, growing from current
    levels to 1.6 million units in 2014 (terminal growth year)
    and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical
    margins for those business units by 2014 (terminal growth year).
    We generally utilize our weighted average cost of capital
    (discount rate) of approximately nine percent to discount the
    estimated cash flows. However, in 2009 and 2008, due to market
    conditions, we increased the discount rate for most of our
    reporting units, based upon a review of the current risks
    impacting our businesses.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we estimated that future
    discounted cash flows projected for most of our reporting units
    were greater than the carrying values. Any increases in
    estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the
    reported value of goodwill.

If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an
    allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit
    to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting
    unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets
    (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair value of a reporting
    unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is
    the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is
    recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s recorded
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

In 2009, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for
    goodwill aggregating $262 million ($180 million, after
    tax). The pre-tax impairment charge of $39 million relates
    to our European shower enclosure manufacturer and reflects a
    decline in the reporting unit’s anticipated long-term
    outlook. The pre-tax impairment charge of $223 million
    relates to our manufacturer of staple gun tackers and other
    fastening tools and reflects a decline in the reporting
    unit’s anticipated long-term outlook.

A five percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our
    reporting units at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in
    a Step Two Analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one
    reporting unit in the Installation and Other Services segment. A
    ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our
    reporting units at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in
    a Step Two Analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one
    reporting unit in the Cabinets and Related Products segment, one
    reporting unit in the Installation and Other Services segment
    and one reporting unit in the Other Specialty Products segment.

We review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events occur
    or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired
    without regard to the reporting unit. We consider the
    implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition
    and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales
    and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact
    on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the
    near-and long-term.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using
    the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We
    evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable
    intangible assets at each



reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances
    warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Our 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005
    Plan”) provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives
    in various forms to employees and non-employee Directors. At
    December 31, 2009, outstanding stock-based incentives were
    in the form of long-term stock awards, stock options, phantom
    stock awards and stock appreciation rights.

Long-Term
    Stock Awards

We grant long-term stock awards to key employees and
    non-employee Directors and do not cause net share dilution
    inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and
    retiring an equal number of shares on the open market. We
    measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market
    price of our common stock at the grant date. There was
    $126 million (nine million common shares) of total
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock
    awards at December 31, 2009, which was included as a
    reduction of common stock and paid-in capital. Effective
    January 1, 2006, we recognize this expense ratably over the
    shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 5
    to 10 years (except for stock awards held by grantees
    age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or the length
    of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. For stock awards granted prior to January 1,
    2006, we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the
    stock awards, typically 10 years, or for executive grantees
    that are, or will become, retirement-eligible during the vesting
    period, we recognize the expense over five years or immediately
    upon a grantee’s retirement. Pre-tax compensation expense
    for the annual vesting of long-term stock awards was
    $37 million for 2009.

Stock
    Options

We grant stock options to key employees and non-employee
    Directors. The exercise price equals the market price of our
    common stock at the grant date. These options generally become
    exercisable (vest ratably) over five years beginning on the
    first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later
    than 10 years after the grant date.

We measure compensation expense for stock options using a
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006, we recognize this
    compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting
    period of the stock options, typically five years, or the length
    of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006,
    we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the vesting
    period of the stock options, typically five years. Pre-tax
    compensation expense for stock options was $25 million for
    2009.

We estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    assumptions for 2009: risk-free interest rate — 2.60%,
    dividend yield — 3.70%, volatility factor —
    39.18% and expected option life — 6 years. For
    expense calculation purposes, the weighted average grant-date
    fair value of option shares granted in 2009 was $2.28 per option
    share.

If we increased our assumptions for the risk-free interest rate
    and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense
    related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2009 would
    increase by 53 percent. If we decreased our assumptions for
    the risk-free interest rate and the volatility factor by
    50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock
    options granted in 2009 would decrease by 61 percent.

Employee
    Retirement Plans

Accounting for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating
    the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon
    vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the
    time period each



employee works. We develop our pension costs and obligations
    from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key
    assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets,
    mortality rates, compensation increases and discount rates for
    obligations and expenses. We consider current market conditions,
    including changes in interest rates, in selecting these
    assumptions. Changes in assumptions used could result in changes
    to reported pension costs and obligations within our
    consolidated financial statements.

In March 2009, based on management’s recommendation, the
    Board of Directors approved a plan to freeze all future benefit
    accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and
    non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans. The freeze was
    effective January 1, 2010. As a result of this action, the
    liabilities for the plans impacted by the freeze were remeasured
    and we recognized a curtailment charge of $8 million in the
    first quarter of 2009.

In December 2009, we decreased our discount rate for obligations
    to an average of 5.80 percent from 6.10 percent. The
    discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected
    duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities
    matched to the December 31, 2009 Citigroup Pension Discount
    Curve. The discount rates we use for our defined-benefit pension
    plans ranged from 2.60 percent to 6.25 percent, with
    the most significant portion of the liabilities having a
    discount rate for obligations of 5.60 percent or higher.
    The assumed asset return was primarily 8.00 percent,
    reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.

Our net underfunded amount for our qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans, the difference between the projected benefit
    obligation and plan assets, decreased to $332 million at
    December 31, 2009 from $344 million at
    December 31, 2008, primarily due to the decision to freeze
    all future benefit accruals; in accordance with accounting
    guidance, the underfunded amount has been recognized on our
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008.
    Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2009 had a net gain of
    approximately 22 percent compared to average gains of
    21 percent for the corporate funds universe within the
    Independent Consultant Cooperative.

Our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non-qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans was $152 million at
    December 31, 2009 compared with $147 million at
    December 31, 2008; such unfunded amount has been recognized
    on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and
    2008.

We expect pension expense for our qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans to be $33 million in 2010 compared with
    $40 million in 2009. If we assumed that the future return
    on plan assets was one-half percent lower than the assumed asset
    return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points,
    the 2010 pension expense would increase by $4 million. We
    expect pension expense for our non-qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans to be $8 million in 2010 compared with
    $15 million in 2009.

We have several funding options and credits available and we
    anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately
    $20 million to $25 million in 2010 to our qualified
    defined-benefit plans.

Income
    Taxes

We have considered potential sources of future taxable income in
    determining the amount of valuation allowance against our
    deferred tax assets. Of the $582 million of deferred tax
    assets recorded at December 31, 2009 net of the
    valuation allowance, $432 million is anticipated to be
    realized through the future reversal of existing taxable
    temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, and
    $150 million is anticipated to be realized through future
    gains from investments and other identified tax-planning
    strategies, including the potential sale of certain operating
    assets and through capital gains in the carryback period.

The continued utilization of our tax-planning strategies is
    largely dependent upon the future performance of certain
    businesses. A significant decline in the expectation of future
    performance may impact our valuation allowance assessment.

Should we determine that we would not be able to realize our
    deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the
    valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such
    determination is made. The need



to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets
    may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.

Effective January 1, 2007, the FASB issued new guidance
    which allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits
    that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
    sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. This new
    guidance establishes a lower threshold for recognizing reserves
    for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions
    (referred to as “unrecognized tax benefits”).
    Therefore, we believe that there is a greater potential for
    volatility in our effective tax rate because this lower
    threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the
    inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number
    of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits
    computation to a greater degree than with prior guidance.

While we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain
    tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary
    from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
    Accordingly, additional provisions for tax-related matters,
    including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income
    tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the
    underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.

Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Certain of our products and product finishes and services are
    covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and
    workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the
    product. At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for
    estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair
    or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. Our
    estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that we experience any changes in
    warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those
    claims, our warranty liability is adjusted accordingly.

The majority of our business is at the consumer retail level
    through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return
    a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However,
    certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and
    other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from
    us. Our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type
    of return when recognizing revenue, and we record deductions at
    the time of sale.

We are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with
    respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of
    business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters
    require estimates and judgments based upon our professional
    knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel. When
    estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting
    guidance, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The
    ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to
    subsequent developments. See Note S to our consolidated
    financial statements for information regarding certain of our
    legal proceedings.

Corporate
    Development Strategy

Our current business strategy includes the rationalization of
    our business units, including consolidations, and increasing
    synergies among our business units. Going forward, we expect to
    maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow,
    organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new
    product development,

start-up

businesses related to home energy services and greenfield
    locations related to certain Installation and Other Services
    businesses. As part of our strategic planning, we continue to
    review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may
    not be core to our long-term growth strategy.

During 2009, we sold two European business units in the Plumbing
    Products segment that were not core to our long-term growth
    strategy. We recognized a net pre-tax loss of $43 million
    in 2009 related to these transactions.

We accounted for the business units which were sold in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, as discontinued operations. See Note B to
    the consolidated financial statements for more information.



During 2009, we acquired a small business in the Plumbing
    Products segment; this business allows us to expand into a
    developing market and had annual sales of $11 million, for
    a net purchase price of $6 million in cash. During 2008, we
    acquired a relatively small countertop business (Cabinet and
    Related Products segment). This business, which allows us to
    expand products and services we offer to our customers, had
    annual sales of over $40 million. During 2007, we acquired
    several relatively small installation service businesses
    (Installation and Other Services segment), as well as Erickson
    Construction Company and Guy Evans, Inc. (Installation and Other
    Services segment).

The results of these acquisitions are included in the
    consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of
    acquisition.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Historically, we have largely funded our growth through cash
    provided by a combination of our operations, long-term bank debt
    and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by the
    issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain
    mergers and acquisitions.

Maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash
    generation are among our financial strategies; such strategies
    have led to cash of over $1.4 billion at December 31,
    2009. Our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was
    58 percent and 57 percent at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

At our request, in late April 2009, our Bank Group modified the
    terms of our Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, which expires
    in February 2011. After reviewing our anticipated liquidity
    position, we requested that the maximum amount we could borrow
    under this facility be reduced to $1.25 billion from
    $2.0 billion; in addition, the debt to total capitalization
    ratio requirement has been increased from 60 percent to
    65 percent. The debt to total capitalization ratio and the
    minimum net worth covenants have also been amended to allow the
    add-back, if incurred, of up to the first $500 million of
    certain non-cash charges, including goodwill and other
    intangible asset impairment charges that would negatively impact
    shareholders’ equity. We incurred approximately
    $2 million of fees and expenses associated with the
    Amendment. If the facility is utilized, we will incur higher
    borrowing costs as a result of the Amendment.

The Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains a
    requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at
    December 31, 2009, our net worth exceeded such requirement
    by $1.0 billion. Under the terms of the Amended Five-Year
    Revolving Credit Agreement, any outstanding Letters of Credit
    reduce our borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2009, we had
    $83 million of unused Letters of Credit. The Amended
    Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement also contains limitations
    on additional borrowings, related to the debt to total
    capitalization requirements; at December 31, 2009, we had
    additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to
    $1.2 billion. In addition, at December 31, 2009, we
    could absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of
    approximately $867 million, and remain in compliance with
    the debt to total capitalization covenant.

In order to borrow under the Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit
    Agreement, there must not be any defaults in our covenants in
    the credit agreement (i.e., in addition to the two financial
    covenants, principally limitations on subsidiary debt, negative
    pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and
    maintenance of insurance) and our representations and warranties
    in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects on
    the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no material adverse
    change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse
    change, in each case since December 31, 2008, no material
    ERISA or environmental non-compliance and no material tax
    deficiency). We were in compliance with all debt covenants at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

We had cash and cash investments of over $1.4 billion at
    December 31, 2009 principally as a result of strong cash
    flows from operations.

Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest
    bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts, money
    market mutual funds containing government securities and
    treasury obligations. While we attempt to diversify these
    investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible
    that future changes in the financial markets could affect the
    security or availability of these investments.



We have maintained investments in

available-for-sale

and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds,
    principally as part of our tax planning strategies, as any gains
    enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax
    losses. We determined that the longer maturity of private equity
    funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in
    more liquid

available-for-sale

and marketable securities to balance risk. Since we have
    significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by
    generating capital gains from investments and other sources, we
    have and will continue to reduce our investments in long-term
    financial assets.

During 2009, we announced the reduction of our quarterly
    dividend to $.075 per common share from $.235 per common share.

We have a scheduled maturity of our long-term indebtedness in
    March 2010 when $300 million of our Floating Rate Notes
    become due. Subsequent to this maturity, we have no scheduled
    maturities until July 2012 when our $850 million of 5.875%
    fixed rate notes become due.

Our working capital ratio was 1.9 to 1 and 2.1 to 1 at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
    manage exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to
    the European euro and the U.S. dollar.

Our cash and cash investments increased $385 million to
    $1,413 million at December 31, 2009, from
    $1,028 million at December 31, 2008.

Net cash provided by operations of $705 million consisted
    primarily of net (loss) adjusted for non-cash and certain other
    items, including depreciation and amortization expense of
    $254 million, net loss on disposition of businesses of
    $40 million, a $262 million charge for the impairment
    of goodwill, a $10 million charge for the impairment of
    financial investments and other non-cash items, including
    stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense related
    to in-store displays and interest expense on the Zero Coupon
    Convertible Senior Notes, as well as a net decrease in working
    capital of $235 million.



We continue to emphasize balance sheet management, including
    working capital management and cash flow generation. Days sales
    in accounts receivable were 48 days at December 31,
    2009 compared with 50 days at December 31, 2008, and
    days sales in inventories were 48 days at both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. Accounts payable days were
    47 days at December 31, 2009 and 43 days at
    December 31, 2008. Working capital (defined as accounts
    receivable and inventories less accounts payable) as a percent
    of sales was 14.7 percent at both December 31, 2009
    and 2008.

Net cash used for financing activities was $197 million,
    and included cash outflows of $166 million for cash
    dividends paid, $11 million for the net payment of debt and
    $11 million for the acquisition of our common stock to
    offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in
    2009.

At December 31, 2009, we had remaining Board of
    Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to an additional
    30 million shares of our common stock in open-market
    transactions or otherwise. We believe that our present cash
    balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund
    our near-term working capital and other investment needs. We
    believe that our longer-term working capital and other general
    corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from
    operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings
    and future financial market activities. Consistent with past
    practice, we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2010 to offset
    any dilution from long-term stock awards granted or stock
    options exercised as part of our compensation programs.

Net cash used for investing activities was $118 million,
    and included $125 million for capital expenditures and
    $8 million for acquisitions. Cash provided by investing
    activities included primarily $31 million of net proceeds
    from the disposition of businesses and property and equipment
    and $11 million from the net sale of financial investments.

We invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase
    our productivity to improve customer service and to support new
    product innovation. Capital expenditures for 2009 were
    $125 million, compared with $200 million for 2008 and
    $248 million for 2007; for 2010, capital expenditures,
    excluding any potential 2010 acquisitions, are expected to
    approximate $190 million. Depreciation and amortization
    expense for 2009 totaled $254 million, compared with
    $238 million for 2008 and $248 million for 2007; for
    2010, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any
    potential 2010 acquisitions, is expected to approximate
    $240 million. Amortization expense totaled
    $17 million, $17 million and $20 million in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with
    existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor,
    in our opinion, are they expected to have, a material effect on
    our capital expenditures, financial position or results of
    operations.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

We report our financial results in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United
    States. However, we believe that certain non-GAAP performance
    measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide
    users of this financial information with additional meaningful
    comparisons between current results and results in prior
    periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be
    viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our
    reported results.



Sales
    and Operations

Net sales for 2009 were $7.8 billion, representing a
    decrease of 18 percent from 2008. Excluding results from
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales
    decreased 16 percent compared with 2008. The following
    table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions:

Net sales for 2009 were adversely affected by declines in the
    new home construction market, which reduced sales volume by
    approximately nine percent compared to 2008. Economic conditions
    remain difficult in the new home construction market as
    full-year 2009 housing starts have declined over 38 percent
    to 554,000 from 2008. Net sales for 2009 were also negatively
    affected by declines in consumer spending for home improvement
    products, which contributed to lower sales volume, reducing net
    sales by approximately six percent compared to 2008. Such
    declines were partially offset by net selling price increases
    for certain products, which increased sales by approximately one
    percent compared to 2008.

Net sales volume of our International products declined in local
    currencies and reduced consolidated net sales by approximately
    three percent compared to 2008. A stronger U.S. dollar
    decreased sales by two percent compared to 2008.

Our gross profit margins were 25.9 percent,
    24.9 percent and 27.5 percent in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The increase in the 2009 gross profit margin
    reflects the improved relationship between selling prices and
    commodity costs and the benefits associated with our business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
    sales were 21.8 percent in 2009 compared with
    19.0 percent in 2008 and 17.1 percent in 2007.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
    sales in 2009 and 2008 reflect lower sales volume, increased
    advertising expenses related to new product introductions and
    increased system implementation costs.

Operating profit in 2009, 2008 and 2007 includes
    $94 million, $78 million and $78 million, net,
    respectively, of costs and charges related to our business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating
    profit in 2009, 2008 and 2007 includes $262 million,
    $467 million and $119 million, respectively, of
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets.
    Operating profit in 2009 and 2008 includes $7 million and
    $9 million, respectively, of charges for litigation
    settlements. Operating profit margins, as reported, were
    0.7 percent, 0.9 percent and 9.3 percent in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating profit margins, excluding
    the items above, were 5.4 percent, 6.8 percent and
    11.0 percent in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Operating profit margins in 2009 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed
    costs and lower selling prices related to the decline in the new
    home construction market in North America as well as lower sales
    volume of plumbing products in the North American and
    International home improvement markets. Such declines were
    partially offset by increased sales of paints and stains, the
    improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs
    across our businesses and the benefits associated with business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating
    profit margins in 2008 were adversely affected by accelerating
    declines in new home construction and a continued decline in
    consumer spending in North American and International markets,
    both of which negatively impacted the



sales volume in each of our segments and negatively impacted
    operating profit margins by approximately two percentage points
    compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in 2007 were
    adversely affected by a decline in new home construction and a
    moderation in consumer spending in North America, both of which
    negatively impacted the sales volume of installation and other
    services, cabinets and windows and doors.

Other
    Income (Expense), Net

During 2009, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
    aggregating $10 million for our investments in private
    equity funds.

Other, net, for 2009 included $3 million of income from
    financial investments, net. Other, net, for 2009 also included
    realized foreign currency gains of $17 million and other
    miscellaneous items.

During 2008, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
    aggregating $58 million primarily related to financial
    investments in TriMas common stock ($31 million), Asahi Tec
    common stock ($1 million), private equity funds
    ($23 million) and other investments ($3 million).

Other, net, for 2008 included $3 million of realized
    losses, net, from the sale of marketable securities and
    $4 million of income from other investments, net. Other,
    net, for 2008 also included realized foreign currency losses of
    $29 million and other miscellaneous items.

During 2007, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
    aggregating $22 million related to financial investments in
    Furniture Brands International common stock ($6 million),
    Asahi Tec common stock ($3 million), auction rate
    securities ($3 million) and private equity funds
    ($10 million).

Other, net, for 2007 included $5 million of realized gains,
    net, from the sale of marketable securities, $6 million of
    dividend income and $38 million of income from other
    investments, net. Other, net, for 2007 also included
    $9 million of realized foreign currency gains and other
    miscellaneous items.

Interest expense was $225 million, $228 million and
    $258 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    decrease in interest expense in 2008 is primarily due to lower
    interest rates and the retirement of higher fixed-rate debt in
    2007 and 2008.

(Loss)
    Income and (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing
    Operations (Attributable to Masco Corporation)

(Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing
    operations for 2009 were $(140) million and $(.41) per
    common share, respectively. (Loss) and diluted (loss) per common
    share from continuing operations for 2008 were
    $(366) million and $(1.06) per common share, respectively.
    Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing
    operations for 2007 were $502 million and $1.32 per common
    share, respectively. (Loss) from continuing operations for 2009
    included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill of
    $262 million ($180 million or $.51 per common share,
    after tax). (Loss) from continuing operations for 2008 included
    non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other
    intangible assets of $467 million ($445 million or
    $1.26 per common share, after tax). Income from continuing
    operations for 2007 included non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of
    $119 million ($100 million or $.27 per common share,
    after tax).

Our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations
    was a 33 percent tax benefit in 2009 and a 69 percent
    tax expense in 2008 and for income from continuing operations
    was a 39 percent tax expense in 2007. Our effective tax
    rate for income from continuing operations, excluding the
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets, was
    30 percent, 57 percent and 36 percent in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Compared to our normalized
    effective tax rate of 36 percent, the lower effective tax
    rate in 2009 is due primarily to the reversal of an accrual for
    unrecognized tax benefits related to a withholding tax issue
    from a formerly held European company due to a recent favorable
    court decision. The higher effective tax rate in 2008 reflects
    the additional U.S. tax on a repatriation of low-taxed
    earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to utilize a
    foreign tax credit carryforward, combined with a decrease in our
    2008 pre-tax income. We expect our tax rate for 2010 to be
    approximately 37 percent.



Outlook
    for the Company

We expect that business conditions in 2010 will improve compared
    to 2009. While we are concerned about the impact of current
    unemployment levels, foreclosure activity and access to
    financing, we believe that housing starts will improve in 2010
    and will increase to a range of 600,000 to 700,000 units
    from 554,000 units in 2009.

While we anticipate that expenditures on repair and remodel
    activity will improve modestly in 2010 from 2009 levels, we
    believe that big-ticket items will continue to be deferred until
    general economic conditions, credit availability and home prices
    improve.

We are confident that the long-term fundamentals for the new
    home construction and home improvement markets are positive. We
    believe that our strong financial position, together with our
    current strategy of investing in leadership brands (including:
    KraftMaid and Merillat cabinets, Delta and Hansgrohe faucets,
    Behr paint and Milgard windows), our continued focus on
    innovation and our commitment to lean principles, will allow us
    to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.

Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business
    Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general
    corporate expense, net, charge for defined-benefit plan
    curtailment, charge for litigation settlements, accelerated

    assets, net, and impairment charges for goodwill and other
    intangible assets in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Business
    Rationalizations and Other Initiatives

Over the past several years, we have been focused on the
    strategic rationalization of our businesses, including business
    consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system
    implementations and other cost savings initiatives. For the year
    ended December 31, 2009, we incurred net costs and charges
    of $94 million pre-tax related to these initiatives. Based
    on current plans, we anticipate costs and charges related to our
    business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate
    $38 million in 2010. We continue to evaluate our businesses
    and may implement additional rationalization programs based on
    changes in our markets which could result in further costs and
    charges. In February 2010, we announced the combination of our
    Builder Cabinet Group and Retail Cabinet Group to
    form Masco Cabinetry; the additional cost is currently
    estimated at approximately $30 million to $35 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred net costs
    and charges of $78 million pre-tax related to these
    initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we
    incurred net costs and charges of $78 million related to
    business rationalizations, net of an $8 million gain from
    the sale of fixed assets.

Cabinets
    and Related Products

Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased in 2009
    primarily due to a decline in sales volume of cabinets in the
    new home construction and retail markets, as well as a less
    favorable product mix, which combined to reduce sales in this
    segment by approximately 24 percent compared to 2008 and
    16 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Net sales in this
    segment were also negatively impacted by lower local currency
    sales volume of International operations, which reduced sales in
    this segment by approximately three percent compared to 2008 and
    by approximately five percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Such
    declines were partially offset by increased selling prices,
    which increased sales by approximately one percent in 2009
    compared to 2008. Net sales in this segment in 2007 were
    negatively affected by a decline in sales volume of cabinets in
    the new home construction market, as well as a decline in net
    sales of

ready-to-assemble

cabinets. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by two
    percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and a weaker U.S. dollar
    increased sales by one percent in 2008 compared to 2007.

Operating profit margins in the Cabinets and Related Products
    segment in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume
    in the new home construction and retail markets and the related
    under-absorption of fixed costs, as well as a less favorable
    product mix which, on a combined basis, reduced operating profit
    margins by approximately three percentage points compared to
    2008. In 2009, operating profit margins in this segment were
    also negatively affected by increased plant closure and system
    implementation costs. Such declines were partially offset by the
    improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs
    and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and
    other cost savings initiatives. Operating profit margins in this
    segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume
    and the related under-absorption of fixed costs and a less
    favorable product mix which reduced operating profit margins by
    approximately six percentage points compared to 2007, as well as
    increased plant closure and system implementation costs. In
    2008, operating profit margins were also negatively affected by
    lower results of International operations included in this
    segment, which reduced operating profit margins by approximately
    two percentage points compared to 2007. In 2007, operating
    profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by the
    decline in sales volume, as well as increased

start-up

costs and the under-utilization of two new plants, and increased
    severance costs. Such declines were partially offset by a gain
    on the sale of a manufacturing facility of $8 million and
    benefits associated with business rationalizations and other
    initiatives.



Plumbing
    Products

Net sales of Plumbing Products decreased in 2009 and 2008
    primarily due to lower sales volume to North American retailers
    and wholesalers, which reduced sales by approximately ten
    percent in both 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to
    2007. Reflecting the weakened global economy, net sales in this
    segment in 2009 and 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower
    local currency sales volume of International operations, which
    reduced sales in this segment by approximately six percent in
    2009 compared to 2008 and by approximately three percent in 2008
    compared to 2007. Such declines were partially offset by net
    selling price increases, which increased sales by approximately
    three percent in both 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared
    to 2007. Net sales in this segment in 2007 were positively
    affected by increased sales volume of certain International
    operations, as well as increased selling prices, which were
    partially offset by declining sales volume to North American
    retail and wholesale customers. A stronger U.S. dollar
    decreased sales by three percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and a
    weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by two percent in 2008
    compared to 2007.

Operating profit margins in the Plumbing Products segment in
    2009 were positively affected by the improved relationship
    between selling prices and commodity costs, as well as a more
    favorable product mix and the benefits associated with business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating
    profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected
    by the decline in North American and International sales volume,
    which reduced operating profit margins by approximately one
    percentage point compared to 2007; such declines were partially
    offset by net selling price increases. Operating profit margins
    in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by increased
    commodity costs in early 2007, which were offset by selling
    price increases and the reduction of certain variable expenses,
    as well as lower rationalization costs.

Installation
    and Other Services

Net sales of Installation and Other Services decreased in 2009
    and 2008 primarily due to significantly lower sales volume
    related to the decline in the new home construction market which
    declined over 38 percent in 2009 compared to 2008, as well
    as lower selling prices. Net sales in this segment in 2007 were
    negatively affected by lower sales volume related to the
    slowdown in the new home construction market and declines in
    selling prices, partially offset by acquisitions.

Operating profit margins in the Installation and Other Services
    segment in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume
    and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, selling price
    decreases and increased system implementation costs. Operating
    profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected
    by lower sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed
    costs, as well as decreased selling prices and increased bad
    debt expense, which decreased operating profit margins by
    approximately seven percentage points; such declines were
    partially offset by material price decreases. Operating profit
    margins in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed
    costs, lower selling prices and increased bad debt expense,
    severance and location closure costs and increased system
    implementation expenses; such declines were partially offset by
    reductions in material costs, as well as benefits associated
    with the business rationalizations and other initiatives.

Decorative
    Architectural Products

Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased in
    2009, primarily due to increased retail sales volume of paints
    and stains, which offset lower retail sales volume of
    builders’ hardware. Sales of paints and stains in 2009
    benefited from new product introductions and advertising and
    promotional activities. Net sales in this segment decreased in
    2008, primarily due to lower retail sales volume of paints and
    stains and builders’ hardware, which more than offset
    selling price increases. Net sales in this segment in 2007 were
    positively affected by higher retail sales volume from new
    product introductions of paints and stains, which partially
    offset sales declines related to builder’s hardware.

Operating profit margins in the Decorative Architectural
    Products segment in 2009 were positively affected by increased
    sales volume of paints and stains, which more than offset lower
    sales volume of builders’ hardware. The operating profit
    margins in this segment also benefited from the improved



relationship between selling prices and commodity costs related
    to paints and stains and builders’ hardware, as well as
    lower program costs related to builders’ hardware.
    Operating profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume of paints and stains and
    builders’ hardware, increasing material costs throughout
    2008 and program costs for builders’ hardware, which more
    than offset the effect of selling price increases. Operating
    profit margins in this segment in 2007 primarily reflect
    increased sales volume of paints and stains, offset by increased
    advertising expenses.

Other
    Specialty Products

Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased primarily due to
    lower sales volume of windows in the western United States,
    selling price decreases and a less favorable product mix, which
    decreased sales in this segment by approximately 12 percent
    in 2009 compared to 2008. Net sales in this segment also
    decreased in 2009 due to a decline in retail sales of staple gun
    tackers and other fastening tools, which reduced sales in this
    segment by three percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Net sales in
    this segment in 2008 and 2007 were negatively impacted by lower
    sales volume of windows and doors, as well as a decline in the
    home improvement market. Net sales in this segment were also
    negatively impacted by lower local currency sales volume of
    International operations, which reduced sales in this segment by
    approximately two percent compared to 2007, due to the decline
    in the United Kingdom markets. A stronger U.S. dollar
    decreased sales by three percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and by
    one percent in 2008 compared to 2007.

Operating profit margins in the Other Specialty Products segment
    in 2009 reflect the benefits associated with business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives which offset
    the negative affect of lower sales volume of windows and staple
    gun tackers and other fastening tools and the related
    under-absorption of fixed costs, as well as a less favorable
    product mix. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2008
    were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related
    under-absorption of fixed costs, which decreased operating
    profit margins by approximately seven percentage points compared
    to 2007, as well as increased plant closure costs. Operating
    profit margins were also negatively affected by lower results of
    International operations, which reduced operating profit margins
    by approximately two percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007.
    Operating profit margins in this segment in 2007 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume of windows and doors in the new
    home construction market and lower results of International
    operations.

Geographic
    Area Results Discussion

North
    America

North American net sales in 2009 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets
    and windows in the new home construction market which decreased
    sales from North American operations by approximately
    12 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, North
    American net sales were negatively affected by lower retail
    sales volume of cabinets, plumbing products, builder’s
    hardware and staple gun tackers and other fastening tools, which
    aggregated to a net decrease in North American net sales of
    approximately nine percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Such
    declines were partially offset by increased sales of paints and
    stains and increased selling prices for certain products. North
    American net sales in 2008 were negatively affected by lower
    sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets and
    windows and doors in the new home construction market which
    decreased sales from North American operations by approximately
    13 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. In addition, North
    American net sales were negatively affected by lower retail
    sales volume of cabinets, plumbing products, paints and stains
    and builder’s hardware, which aggregated to a net decrease
    in North American sales of approximately eight percent in
    2008 compared to 2007. North American sales in 2007 were
    negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and
    other services, cabinets and windows and doors in the new home
    construction market, as well as lower retail sales volume of
    certain products, partially offset by increased retail sales
    volume of paints and stains.

The declines in operating profit margins from North American
    operations in 2009 were primarily due to sales volume declines
    and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, selling price
    decreases and a less



favorable product mix in new home construction markets, which
    decreased operating profit margins by one percentage point in
    2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit margins were also
    negatively affected by increased rationalization costs and
    charges in 2009 compared to 2008. Such declines were partially
    offset by the improved relationship between selling prices and
    commodity costs for cabinets, plumbing products and paints and
    stains, as well as the benefits associated with business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. The
    declines in operating profit margins from North American
    operations in 2008 were primarily due to declines in new home
    construction and consumer spending, which negatively impacted
    the sales volume of the Company’s products and decreased
    operating profit margins by approximately three percentage
    points in 2008 compared to 2007. The operating profit margins
    from North American operations in 2007 were negatively affected
    by declines in new home construction and consumer spending; such
    declines were partially offset by selling price increases, and
    the benefits associated with the Company’s business
    rationalizations and other initiatives.

International,
    Principally Europe

Net sales from International operations decreased in 2009
    primarily due to lower sales volume of plumbing products and
    cabinets, which reduced sales from International operations in
    local currencies by approximately 12 percent compared to
    2008 and by approximately 13 percent in 2008 compared to
    2007. Such declines were partially offset by selling price
    increases, which increased sales from International operations
    by approximately two percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and in
    2008 compared to 2007. Net sales from International operations
    in 2007 were positively affected by increased sales volume of
    plumbing products. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased
    International net sales by seven percent in 2009 compared to
    2008 and a weaker U.S. dollar increased International net
    sales by three percent in 2008 compared to 2007.

Operating profit margins in 2009 were positively affected by the
    improved relationship between selling prices and commodity
    costs, as well as the benefits associated with business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating
    profit margins in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales
    volumes and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, as well
    as increased severance and plant closure costs. Operating profit
    margins in 2007 were negatively affected by a less favorable
    product mix and material cost increases.

    and Contingencies

Litigation

Information regarding our legal proceedings is set forth in
    Note S to the consolidated financial statements.

Other
    Commitments

With respect to our investments in private equity funds, we had,
    at December 31, 2009, commitments to contribute up to
    $37 million of additional capital to such funds,
    representing our aggregate capital commitment to such funds less
    capital contributions made to date. We are contractually
    obligated to make additional capital contributions to these
    private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the
    private equity fund. We have no control over when or if the
    capital calls will occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and
    generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our
    investment in the private equity fund when paid.

We enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary
    indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which
    we operate. Such indemnifications include claims made against
    builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and
    workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other
    transactions, we occasionally provide reasonable and customary
    indemnifications relating to various items, including: the
    enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues;
    and provisions for sales returns. We have never had to pay a
    material amount related to these indemnifications, and we
    evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and we
    appropriately record an estimated liability when probable.

Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of
    future cash outflows associated with unrecognized tax benefits,
    we are unable to make a reasonable estimate for the period
    beyond the next year in which cash settlements may occur with
    applicable tax authorities.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding how a company
    determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or
    is not controlled through voting should be consolidated. The
    determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an
    entity is based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose
    and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. This guidance is effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2010. The Company does not expect that
    the adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated
    financial condition and results of operations.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We have considered the provisions of accounting guidance
    regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative
    financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, and
    disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about
    market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments, other
    financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments.

We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and
    foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business
    and to market price fluctuations related to our marketable
    securities and other investments. We have limited involvement
    with derivative financial instruments and use such instruments
    to the extent necessary to manage exposure to fluctuations in
    interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations and from time
    to time commodity fluctuations. See Note F to the
    consolidated financial statements for additional information
    regarding our derivative instruments.

At December 31, 2009, we have entered into foreign currency
    forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations
    related primarily to the European euro and the U.S. dollar.

At December 31, 2009, we performed sensitivity analyses to
    assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk
    sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of
    10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates or a
    10 percent decline in the market value of our long-term
    investments. Based upon the analyses performed, such changes
    would not be expected to materially affect our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Masco Corporation is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Masco Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

The management of Masco Corporation assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2009 using the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.” Based on this assessment, management has
    determined that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, performed an audit of the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of
    Masco Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009. Their report expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Masco
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009 and expressed an unqualified opinion
    on the Company’s 2009 consolidated financial statements.
    This report appears under Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data under the heading Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Masco Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Masco
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly,
    in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company has changed the manner in which it
    accounts for noncontrolling interests in 2009. As discussed in
    Note Q to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company changed its method of accounting for unrecognized tax
    benefits in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Masco Corporation
    and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
    consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations
    of variable interest entities, for which the Company is the
    primary beneficiary.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of
    Financial Statements.

The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America requires the
    Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
    the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ
    from these estimates and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to
    customers or when services are rendered, net of applicable
    provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. The Company
    records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon
    estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other
    Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables.
    Amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in net
    sales, while costs incurred for shipping and handling are
    included in cost of sales.

Customer Promotion Costs.

The Company records
    estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and
    incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative
    advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based
    incentives. In-store displays that are owned by the Company and
    used to market the Company’s products are included in other
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized
    using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of
    three years; related amortization expense is classified as a
    selling expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Foreign Currency.

The financial statements of
    the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the
    local currency as the functional currency. Assets and
    liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at exchange
    rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are
    translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year.
    The resulting cumulative translation adjustments have been
    recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component
    of shareholders’ equity. Realized foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated
    statements of income in other income (expense), net.

Cash and Cash Investments.

The Company
    considers all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity
    of three months or less to be cash and cash investments.

Receivables.

The Company does significant
    business with a number of customers, including certain home
    centers and homebuilders. The Company monitors its exposure for
    credit losses on its customer receivable balances and the credit
    worthiness of its customers on an on-going basis and records
    related allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are
    estimated based upon specific customer balances, where a risk of
    default has been identified, and also include a provision for
    non-customer specific defaults based upon historical collection,
    return and write-off activity. During downturns in the
    Company’s markets, declines in the financial condition and
    creditworthiness of customers impacts the credit risk of the
    receivables involved and the Company has incurred additional bad
    debt expense related to customer defaults. A separate allowance
    is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally
    based upon sales activity. Receivables are presented net of
    certain allowances (including allowances for doubtful accounts)
    of $75 million at both December 31, 2009 and 2008.
    Receivables include unbilled revenue related to the Installation
    and Other Services segment of $15 million and
    $24 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Continued)

Property and Equipment.

Property and
    equipment, including significant betterments to existing
    facilities, are recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal,
    the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts and any gain or loss is included in the consolidated
    statements of income. Maintenance and repair costs are charged
    against earnings as incurred.

The Company reviews its property and equipment as an event
    occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not
    reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the
    carrying amount. If the carrying amount of property and
    equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows,
    then the Company would recognize an impairment loss for the
    difference between the carrying amount and the current fair
    value. Further, the Company evaluates the remaining useful lives
    of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine
    whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the
    remaining depreciation periods.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense is computed
    principally using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets. Annual depreciation rates are as
    follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10 percent,
    and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation
    expense was $237 million, $220 million and
    $215 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

The
    Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill in
    the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or
    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The
    Company has defined its reporting units and completed the
    impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level.
    The Company’s operating segments are reporting units that
    engage in business activities, for which discrete financial
    information, including five-year forecasts, are available. The
    Company compares the fair value of the reporting units to the
    carrying value of the reporting units for goodwill impairment
    testing. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow
    method, which includes significant unobservable inputs
    (Level 3 inputs).

Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method
    requires the Company to make significant estimates and
    assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows,
    market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The
    Company’s judgments are based upon historical experience,
    current market trends, consultations with external valuation
    specialists and other information. In estimating future cash
    flows, the Company relies on internally generated five-year
    forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital
    expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term
    assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the
    five-year forecast. The Company generally utilizes its weighted
    average cost of capital (discount rate) of approximately nine
    percent to discount the estimated cash flows. However, in 2009
    and 2008, due to market conditions, the Company increased the
    discount rate for most of its reporting units, based upon a
    review of the current risks impacting our businesses. The
    Company records an impairment to goodwill (adjusting the value
    to the estimated fair value) if the book value is below the
    estimated fair value, on a non-recurring basis.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or
    as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets
    may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit. The
    Company considers the implications of both external (e.g.,
    market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and
    internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth)
    factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the
    intangible asset in both the near- and long-term.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using
    the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The
    Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable
    identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to
    determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to
    the remaining



MASCO

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Continued)

periods of amortization. See Note H for additional
    information regarding Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Fair Value Accounting.

On January 1,
    2008, the Company adopted fair value guidance for its financial
    investments and liabilities which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. On January 1,
    2009, the Company adopted this guidance for its non-financial
    investments and liabilities; such adoption did not have a
    significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of financial investments and liabilities is
    determined at each balance sheet date and future declines in
    market conditions, the future performance of the underlying
    investments or new information could affect the recorded values
    of the Company’s investments in marketable securities,
    private equity funds and other private investments.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage
    certain exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows
    resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
    interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability
    measured at fair value. For each derivative financial instrument
    that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge, the gain
    or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting
    loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk,
    are recognized in determining current earnings during the period
    of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments not
    designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is
    recognized in determining current earnings during the period of
    the change in fair value.

Warranty.

At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions.

A majority of the Company’s business is at the consumer
    retail level through home centers and major retailers. A
    consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
    warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not
    distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when
    they claim a return deduction from the Company. The
    Company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account
    this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are
    recorded at the time of sale.

Product Liability.

The Company provides for
    expenses associated with product liability obligations when such
    amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The
    accruals are adjusted as new information develops or
    circumstances change that would affect the estimated liability.

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company measures
    compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of the
    Company’s common stock at the grant date. Effective
    January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably
    over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards,
    typically 5 to 10 years (except for stock awards held by
    grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or
    the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible
    at age 65. For stock awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized over the
    vesting period of the stock awards, typically 10 years, or
    for executive grantees that are, or will become,
    retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the expense is
    being recognized over five years or immediately upon a
    grantee’s retirement.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock options
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is
    being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of
    time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing

model. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006,
    such expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years. The Company utilizes
    the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool
    associated with stock options.

Noncontrolling Interest.

The Company owns
    68 percent of Hansgrohe AG at both December 31, 2009
    and 2008. In accordance with new guidance, the aggregate
    noncontrolling interest, net of dividends, at December 31,
    2009 and 2008 has been recorded as a component of equity on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

In May 2007, a put option was exercised and the Company issued
    two million shares of Company common stock with a value of
    $56 million for an additional four percent ownership in
    Hansgrohe AG.

Interest and Penalties on Unrecognized Tax
    Benefits.

The Company records interest and
    penalties on its unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior-year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation in
    the consolidated financial statements. The results of operations
    related to 2009, 2008 and 2007 discontinued operations have been
    reclassified and separately stated in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income for 2009, 2008 and 2007. In
    the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, the
    cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately
    classified.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In
    June 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding how a company
    determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or
    is not controlled through voting should be consolidated. The
    determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an
    entity is based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose
    and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. This guidance is effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2010. The Company does not expect that
    the adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated
    financial condition and results of operations.

Subsequent Events.

The Company has evaluated
    subsequent events through February 16, 2010, the date the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements were issued.

B.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company sold several business
    units that were not core to the Company’s long-term growth
    strategy. The presentation of discontinued operations includes a
    component of the Company, which comprises operations and cash
    flows, that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the
    Company. The Company has accounted for the business units which
    were sold in 2009, 2008 and 2007, except as noted, as
    discontinued operations.

During 2009, in separate transactions, the Company completed the
    sale of Damixa and Breuer, two European business units in the
    Plumbing Products segment. The Company received gross proceeds
    of $9 million and recognized a net pre-tax loss of
    $43 million for the sale of these business units.

During 2009, the Company recorded income of $1 million
    included in (loss) gain on disposal of discontinued operations,
    net related to cash received for a disposition completed in
    prior years. Also during 2009, the Company recorded other income
    of $2 million included in (loss) gain on disposal of
    discontinued operations, net, reflecting the settlement of
    certain liabilities related to a business unit disposed in prior
    years.

During 2008, in separate transactions, the Company completed the
    sale of its Europe-based The Heating Group business unit (Other
    Specialty Products segment), Glass Idromassaggio (Plumbing
    Products segment) and Alfred Reinecke (Plumbing Products
    segment). Total net proceeds from the sale of these business
    units were $174 million. The Company recorded an impairment
    of assets related to these discontinued operations which
    primarily included the write-down of goodwill of
    $24 million and other assets of $21 million; upon
    completion of the transactions, the Company recognized a net
    gain of $6 million included in (loss) gain on disposal of
    discontinued operations, net. During 2008, the Company recorded
    other net



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

B.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS – (Concluded)

expenses of $3 million included in (loss) gain on disposal
    of discontinued operations, net, reflecting the adjustment of
    certain liabilities related to businesses disposed in prior
    years.

During 2007, the Company completed the sale of Avocet, a
    European business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products
    segment. Total gross proceeds from the sale were
    $41 million; the Company recognized a pre-tax net loss on
    the disposition of Avocet of $11 million. During 2007, the
    Company recorded other net gains of $1 million, reflecting
    the receipt of additional purchase price payments related to
    businesses disposed in 2006 and 2005.

(Losses) gains from these 2009, 2008 and 2007 discontinued
    operations were included in (loss) from discontinued operations,
    net, in the consolidated statements of income.

Selected financial information for the discontinued operations
    during the period owned by the Company, were as follows, in
    millions:

    of $1 million, $1 million and $(1) million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. (Loss) from discontinued
    operations also includes non-cash, pre-tax and after tax
    impairment charges for goodwill of $108 million in 2007.
    The unusual relationship between income taxes and (loss) before
    income taxes resulted primarily from certain losses providing no
    current tax benefit.

During 2007, the Company completed the sale of two small
    businesses, the results of which were included in continuing
    operations through the dates of sale. These small businesses in
    the Plumbing Products segment had combined net sales and
    operating (loss) of $12 million and $(400,000),
    respectively, in 2007 through the respective dates of sale.
    Gross proceeds from the sale of these businesses were
    $10 million; the Company recognized a net loss of
    $8 million included in other, net, in continuing
    operations, related to the sale of these businesses, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

C.

ACQUISITIONS

During 2009, the Company acquired a small business in the
    Plumbing Products segment; this business allows the Company to
    expand into a developing market and had annual sales of
    $11 million. During 2008, the Company acquired a relatively
    small countertop business (Cabinet and Related Products segment)
    which allows the Company to expand the products and services it
    offers to its customers and had annual sales of over
    $40 million. During 2007, the Company acquired several
    relatively small installation service businesses (Installation
    and Other Services segment), as well as Erickson Construction
    Company and Guy Evans, Inc. (Installation and Other Services
    segment).

The results of all acquisitions are included in the consolidated
    financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.

Certain purchase agreements provided for the payment of

    additional $1 million of acquisition-related consideration,

FAIR
    VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES

Accounting Policy.

On January 1, 2008,
    the Company adopted fair value guidance that defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements for its financial
    investments and liabilities. The guidance defines fair value as
    “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
    to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date.” Further, it defines
    a fair value hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 inputs as
    quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities; Level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar
    assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can
    be corroborated by market data; and Level 3 inputs as
    unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and that are financial instruments whose value is
    determined using pricing models or instruments for which the
    determination of fair value requires significant management
    judgment or estimation.

Financial investments that are available to be traded on readily
    accessible stock exchanges (domestic or foreign) are considered
    to have active markets and have been valued using Level 1
    inputs. Financial investments that are not available to be
    traded on a public market or have limited secondary markets, or
    contain provisions that limit the ability to sell the investment
    are considered to have inactive markets and have been valued
    using Level 2 or 3 inputs. The Company incorporated credit
    risk into the valuations of financial investments by estimating
    the likelihood of non-performance by the counterparty to the
    applicable transactions. The estimate included the length of
    time relative to the contract, financial condition of the
    counterparty and current market conditions. The criteria for
    determining if a market was active or inactive were based on the
    individual facts and circumstances.

Financial Investments.

The Company has
    maintained investments in

available-for-sale

securities and a number of private equity funds and other
    private investments, principally as part of its tax planning
    strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current
    and future tax capital losses.

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments are carried at cost. At December 31,
    2009, the Company has investments in 17 venture capital funds,
    with an aggregate carrying value of $28 million. The
    venture capital funds invest in

start-up

or
    smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the
    information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors.
    At December 31, 2009, the Company also has investments in
    28 buyout funds, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $95 million. The buyout funds invest in later-stage,
    established businesses and, other than the Heartland Industrial
    Partners Fund (“Heartland Fund”), which is primarily
    in the automotive and transportation sector, no buyout fund has
    a concentration in a particular sector.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

For
    financial investments measured at fair value on a recurring
    basis at each reporting period, the unrealized gains or losses
    (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax
    effect, through shareholders’ equity, as a component of
    other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and
    charges for

other-than-temporary

impairments are included in determining net income, with related
    purchase costs based upon specific identification.

For marketable securities, the Company reviews, on a recurring
    basis, industry analyst reports, key ratios and statistics,
    market analyses and other factors for each investment to
    determine if an unrealized loss is

other-than-temporary.

FAIR
    VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND
    LIABILITIES – (Continued)

In the past, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate
    securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities
    that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or
    35 days. The fair values of the auction rate securities
    held by the Company have been estimated, on a recurring basis,
    using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). The
    significant inputs in the discounted cash flow model used to
    value the auction rate securities include: expected maturity of
    auction rate securities, discount rate used to determine the
    present value of expected cash flows and assumptions for credit
    defaults, since the auction rate securities are backed by credit
    default swap agreements.

In December 2009, the Company sold its investment in Asahi Tec
    common stock for proceeds approximating book value. The
    preferred stock of Asahi Tec has been valued primarily using a
    discounted cash flow model, because there are currently no
    observable prices in an active market for the same or similar
    securities. The significant inputs in the discounted cash flow
    model used to value the Asahi Tec preferred stock include: the
    present value of future dividends, present value of redemption
    rights, fair value of conversion rights and the discount rate
    based on credit spreads for Japanese-issued preferred securities
    and other market factors. The Asahi Tec preferred stock accrues
    dividends at an annual rate of 1.75% cash at the discretion of
    Asahi Tec or noncash dividends at an annual rate of $1.75% plus
    an additional dividend at an annual rate of 3.75% on the unpaid
    noncash dividend; the Company has elected to record such
    dividends when cash proceeds are received. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the unrealized loss of $2 million
    related to the change in fair value of the derivative related to
    the conversion feature on the Asahi Tec preferred stock, has
    been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    income, in income from other investments, net. At both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the conversion feature value
    was deemed insignificant.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

It is
    not practicable for the Company to estimate a fair value for
    private equity funds and other private investments because there
    are no quoted market prices, and sufficient information is not
    readily available for the Company to utilize a valuation model
    to determine the fair value for each fund. These investments are
    evaluated, on a non-recurring basis, for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an
    event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.

Impairment indicators the Company considers include the
    following: whether there has been a significant deterioration in
    earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a
    significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or
    technological environment; a significant adverse change in the
    general market condition or geographic area in which the
    investment operates; industry and sector performance; current
    equity and credit market conditions; and any bona fide offers to
    purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. The
    Company also considers specific adverse conditions related to
    the financial health of and business outlook for the fund,
    including industry and sector performance. The significant
    assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment include current economic conditions, market analysis
    for specific funds and performance indicators in the automotive
    and transportation, residential and commercial construction,
    bio-technology, health care and information technology sectors
    in which the given funds’ investments operate. Since there
    is no active trading market for these investments, they are for
    the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can
    also have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including
    financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future
    changes in market conditions, the future performance of the
    underlying investments or new information provided by private
    equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such
    investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. Due to
    the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements
    used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3 input.

During 2008, based upon its review of marketable securities, the
    Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of
    $31 million related to its investment in TriMas Corporation
    (“TriMas”) common stock (NYSE: TRS) and
    $1 million related to its investment in Asahi Tec
    Corporation (“Asahi Tec”) common stock (Tokyo
    Stock Exchange: 5606.T). During 2008, the Company determined
    that the decline in the estimated value of certain private
    equity fund investments, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $66 million prior to the impairment, was

other-than-temporary.

Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of
    $23 million. A review of sector performance and other
    factors specific to the underlying investments in six funds
    having

other-than-temporary

During 2007, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges of $6 million related to its investment in
    Furniture Brands International common stock (NYSE: FBN) and
    $3 million related to its investment in Asahi Tec common
    stock. During 2007, the Company also recognized a non-cash,
    pre-tax impairment charge of $3 million related to auction
    rate securities. For the year ended December 31, 2007, as a
    result of the acquisition of Metaldyne Corporation by Asahi Tec,
    the Company recognized a gain of $14 million, net of
    transaction fees, included in the Company’s consolidated
    statement of income in income from other investments, net. In
    addition, immediately prior to its sale, Metaldyne distributed
    shares of TriMas common stock as a dividend to the holders of
    Metaldyne common stock; the Company recognized income of
    $4 million included in the Company’s consolidated
    statement of income, in dividend income from other investments
    for the year ended December 31, 2007. Also, during 2007,
    the Company determined that the decline in the estimated value
    of certain private equity fund investments, with an aggregate
    carrying value of $54 million prior to the impairment, was

other-than-temporary.

Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2007, the

FAIR
    VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND
    LIABILITIES – (Concluded)

The fair value of the Company’s short-term and long-term
    fixed-rate debt instruments is based principally upon quoted
    market prices for the same or similar issues or the current
    rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and
    remaining maturities. The aggregate estimated market value of
    short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2009 was
    approximately $3.9 billion, compared with the aggregate
    carrying value of $4.0 billion. The aggregate estimated
    market value of short-term and long-term debt at
    December 31, 2008 was approximately $3.0 billion,
    compared with the aggregate carrying value of $3.9 billion.

DERIVATIVES

During 2009, the Company, including certain European operations,
    had entered into foreign currency forward contracts with
    notional amounts of $55 million and $10 million to
    manage exposure to currency fluctuations in the European euro
    and the U.S. dollar, respectively. At December 31,
    2008, the Company, including certain European operations, had
    entered into foreign currency forward contracts with notional
    amounts of $31 million and $14 million to manage
    exposure to currency fluctuations in the European euro and the
    U.S. dollar, respectively. Based upon year-end market
    prices, the Company had recorded a $(1) million loss and a
    $2 million gain to reflect the contract prices at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Gains (losses)
    related to these contracts are recorded in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of income in other income (expense),
    net. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms
    of the foreign currency forward contracts, the Company’s
    exposure is limited to the aggregate foreign currency rate
    differential with such institutions.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had entered into foreign
    currency exchange contracts to hedge currency fluctuations
    related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional
    currencies with notional amounts of $161 million. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had recorded a
    $16 million loss on the foreign currency exchange contract,
    which was more than offset by gains related to the translation
    of loans and accounts denominated in non-functional currencies.

The fair value of these derivative contracts is estimated on a
    recurring basis, quarterly, using Level 2 inputs
    (significant other observable inputs).

In 2009, the Company recognized a decrease in interest expense
    of $10 million related to the amortization of the gains
    resulting from the terminations (in 2008 and 2004) of two
    interest rate swap agreements. In 2008, the Company recognized a
    decrease in interest expense of $12 million related to the
    interest rate swap agreements. In 2007, the Company recognized
    an increase in interest expense of $3 million related to
    these swap agreements, due to increasing interest rates.

In the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, the Company completed
    its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets. During each year, there were
    no events or circumstances that would have indicated potential
    impairment.

The impairment tests in 2009 and 2008 indicated that goodwill
    recorded for certain of the Company’s reporting units was
    impaired. The Company recognized the non-cash, pre-tax
    impairment charges for goodwill of $262 million
    ($180 million, after tax) and $456 million
    ($438 million, after tax) for 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    In 2009, the pre-tax impairment charge in the Plumbing Products
    segment relates to a European shower enclosure manufacturer; the
    pre-tax impairment charge in the Other Specialty Products
    segment relates to the Company’s North American
    manufacturer of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.
    The pre-tax impairment charge recognized in 2008, in the
    Cabinets and Related Products, Plumbing Products and Other
    Specialty Products segments, related to three of the
    Company’s United Kingdom manufacturers and distributors; in
    the Installation and Other Services segment, the charge related
    to a small installation service business in North America. The
    impairment charges in 2009 and 2008 reflect the anticipated
    long-term outlook for the reporting units, including declining
    demand for certain products, as well as decreased operating
    profit margins.

Other indefinite-lived intangible assets were $196 million
    and $195 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and principally included registered trademarks. In
    2008, the impairment test indicated that the registered
    trademark for a small installation service business in North
    America in the Installation and Other Services segment and the
    registered trademark for a North American business unit in the
    Other Specialty Products segment were impaired due to changes in
    the anticipated long-term outlook for the business units,
    particularly in the new home construction market. The Company
    recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets of $11 million
    ($7 million, after tax) in 2008.

All of the notes and debentures above are senior indebtedness
    and, other than the 6.625% notes due 2018 and the
    7.75% notes due 2029, are redeemable at the Company’s
    option.

The Company retired $100 million of 5.75% notes on
    October 15, 2008, the scheduled maturity date.

In July 2001, the Company issued $1.9 billion principal
    amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
    2031 (“Old Notes”), resulting in gross proceeds of
    $750 million. The issue price per Note was $394.45 per
    $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented a yield
    to maturity of 3.125% compounded semi-annually. In December
    2004, the Company completed an exchange of the outstanding Old
    Notes for Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes Series B due
    July 2031 (“New Notes or Notes”). The Company will not
    pay interest in cash on the Notes prior to maturity, except in
    certain circumstances, including possible contingent interest
    payments that are not expected to be material. Holders of the
    Notes have the option to require that the Notes be repurchased
    by the Company on July 20, 2011 and every five years
    thereafter. Upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will pay
    the principal return, equal to the lesser of (1) the
    accreted value of the Notes in only cash, and (2) the
    conversion value, as defined, which will be settled in cash or
    shares of Company common stock, or a combination of both, at the
    option of the Company. The Notes are convertible if the average
    price of Company common stock for the 20 days immediately
    prior to the conversion date exceeds


/


%,
    declining by


/


%
    each year thereafter, of the accreted value of the Notes divided
    by the conversion rate of 12.7317 shares for each $1,000
    principal amount at maturity of the Notes. Notes also become
    convertible if the Company’s credit rating is reduced to
    below investment grade, or if certain actions are taken by the
    Company. The Company may at any time redeem all or part of the
    Notes at their then accreted value. On January 20, 2007,
    holders of $1.8 billion (94 percent) principal amount
    at maturity of the Notes required the Company to repurchase
    their Notes at a cash value of $825 million.

A credit rating agency (i.e., Moody’s or Standard and
    Poor’s) is an entity that assigns credit ratings for
    issuers of certain types of debt obligations. In December 2008,
    one rating agency reduced the credit rating on the
    Company’s debt to below investment grade; as a result, the
    Notes are convertible on demand. The

DEBT – (Continued)

Company does not anticipate conversion of the Notes since, based
    on the terms, it would not currently be profitable for holders
    of the Notes to exercise the option to convert the Notes.

At both December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were outstanding
    $108 million principal amount at maturity of Notes, with an
    accreted value of $55 million and $54 million,
    respectively, which has been reclassified to short-term debt.

The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding accounting
    for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash
    upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) effective
    January 1, 2009. The adoption of this new guidance will
    have no impact on 2009 results; the Company recorded a
    $1 million cumulative effect of accounting change as of
    January 1, 2007 and the adoption had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

At the Company’s request, in late April 2009, the Company
    and its Bank Group modified the terms of its Five-Year Revolving
    Credit Facility (“Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit
    Agreement”), which expires February 2011. This agreement
    allows for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars or
    European euros with interest payable based upon various
    floating-rate options as selected by the Company. After
    reviewing its anticipated liquidity position, the Company
    requested that the maximum amount the Company could borrow under
    this facility be reduced to $1.25 billion from
    $2.0 billion; in addition, the debt to total capitalization
    ratio requirement has been increased from 60 percent to
    65 percent. The debt to total capitalization ratio and the
    minimum net worth covenant have also been amended to allow the
    add-back, if incurred, of up to the first $500 million of
    certain non-cash charges, including goodwill and other
    intangible asset impairment charges that would negatively impact
    shareholders’ equity. The Company incurred approximately
    $2 million of fees and expenses associated with the
    Amendment. The Company, if the facility is utilized, will incur
    higher borrowing costs as a result of the Amendment.

The Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains a
    requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s net worth exceeded
    such requirement by $1.0 billion. Under the terms of the
    Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, any outstanding
    Letters of Credit reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity.
    At December 31, 2009, the Company had $83 million of
    unused Letters of Credit. The Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit
    Agreement also contains limitations on additional borrowings,
    related to the debt to total capitalization requirements; at
    December 31, 2009, the Company had additional borrowing
    capacity, subject to availability, of up to $1.2 billion.
    In addition, at December 31, 2009, the Company could absorb
    a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately
    $867 million, and remain in compliance with the debt to
    total capitalization covenant.

In order to borrow under the Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit
    Agreement, there must not be any defaults in the Company’s
    covenants in the credit agreement (i.e., in addition to the two
    financial covenants, principally limitations on subsidiary debt,
    negative pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and
    maintenance of insurance) and the Company’s representations
    and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all
    material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no
    material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a
    material adverse change, in each case since December 31,
    2008, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance and no
    material tax deficiency).

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company was in
    compliance with the requirements of the Amended Five-Year
    Revolving Credit Agreement.

There were no borrowings under the Five-Year Revolving Credit
    Agreement at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) provides for the issuance of stock-based
    incentives in various forms to employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. At December 31, 2009, outstanding
    stock-based incentives were in the form of long-term stock
    awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock
    appreciation rights.

In 2009, the Company recognized $6 million of accelerated

    and options) related to the retirement from full-time employment
    of the Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board of
    Directors; he will continue to serve as a non-executive,
    non-employee Chairman of the Board of Directors.

At December 31, 2009, a total of 12,209,180 shares of
    Company common stock were available under the 2005 Plan for the
    granting of stock options and other long-term stock incentive
    awards.

Long-Term
    Stock Awards

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and
    non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share
    dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of
    repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open
    market.

    shares which vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $16 million, $30 million and $48 million,
    respectively.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market
    price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date.
    These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over
    five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
    grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant
    date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration
    stock options, except for restoration options resulting from
    options previously granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration
    stock options become exercisable six months from the date of
    grant.

The Company granted 5,847,700 of stock option shares, including
    restoration stock option shares, during 2009 with a grant date
    exercise price range of $8 to $14 per share. During 2009,

Phantom
    Stock Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights
    (“SARs”)

The Company grants phantom stock awards and SARs to certain

non-U.S. employees.

Phantom stock awards are linked to the value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant and are settled
    in cash upon vesting, typically over 10 years. The Company
    accounts for phantom stock awards as liability-based awards; the
    compensation expense is initially measured as the market price
    of the Company’s common stock at the grant date and is
    recognized over the vesting period. The liability is remeasured
    and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the
    awards are fully-vested and paid to the employees. The Company
    recognized expense (income) of $3 million,
    $(2) million and $(2) million related to the valuation
    of phantom stock awards for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company granted 318,920 shares,
    234,800 shares and 130,000 shares, respectively, of
    phantom stock awards with an aggregate fair value of
    $3 million, $5 million and $4 million,
    respectively, and paid $1 million, $2 million and
    $4 million of cash in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to
    settle phantom stock awards.

SARs are linked to the value of the Company’s common stock
    on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon exercise. The
    Company accounts for SARs using the fair value method, which
    requires outstanding SARs to be classified as liability-based
    awards and valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model at
    the grant date; such fair value is recognized as compensation
    expense over the vesting period, typically five years. The
    liability is remeasured and adjusted at the end of each
    reporting period until the SARs are exercised and payment is
    made to the employees or the SARs expire. The Company recognized
    expense (income) of $4 million, $(3) million and
    $(5) million related to the valuation of SARs for 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company granted SARs for 438,200 shares,
    597,200 shares and 521,100 shares, respectively, with

EMPLOYEE
    RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors qualified defined-benefit and
    defined-contribution retirement plans for most of its employees.
    In addition to the Company’s qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans, the Company has unfunded non-qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans covering certain employees, which
    provide for benefits in addition to those provided by the
    qualified pension plans. Substantially all salaried employees
    participate in non-contributory defined-contribution retirement
    plans, to which payments are determined annually by the
    Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. Aggregate charges to earnings under the
    Company’s defined-benefit and defined-contribution
    retirement plans were $63 million and $35 million in
    2009, $38 million and $30 million in 2008 and
    $44 million and $47 million in 2007, respectively.

In March 2009, based on management’s recommendation, the
    Board of Directors approved a plan to freeze all future benefit
    accruals under substantially all of the Company’s domestic
    qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans. The
    freeze was effective January 1, 2010. As a result of this
    action, the liabilities for the plans impacted by the freeze
    were remeasured and the Company recognized a curtailment charge
    of $8 million in the first quarter of 2009.

The Company’s qualified defined-benefit pension plan

The investment objectives of the Company’s qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans are: 1) to earn a return, net
    of fees, greater than or equal to the expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets; 2) to diversify the portfolio among
    various asset classes with the goal of reducing volatility of
    return and reducing principal risk; and 3) to maintain
    liquidity sufficient to meet Plan obligations. Long-term target
    allocations are: equity securities (70%), debt securities (25%)
    and other investments (5%).

Plan assets included 1.2 million shares and
    1.4 million shares, respectively, of Company common stock
    valued at $16 million at both December 31, 2009 and
    2008.

The Company’s qualified defined-benefit pension plans have
    adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes
    a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. Accounting guidance defines fair
    value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date.”

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used
    for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in
    the methodologies used at December 31, 2009.

Common and preferred stocks, debt securities and short-term
    and other investments:

Valued at the closing
    price reported on the active market on which the individual
    securities are traded.

Limited Partnerships:

Valued based on an
    estimated fair value. There is no active trading market for
    these investments and they are for the most part illiquid. Due
    to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value
    measurements are a Level 3 input.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation
    that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective
    of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes
    its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other
    market participants, the use of different methodologies or
    assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial
    instruments could result in a different fair value measurement
    at the reporting date.

Major assumptions used in accounting for the Company’s

Expected return on plan assets

4.00%

4.00%

Discount rate for net periodic pension cost

6.10%

6.25%

5.50%

The discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected
    duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities
    matched to the December 31, 2009 Citigroup Pension Discount
    Curve. Such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension
    plans ranged from 2.60 percent to 6.25 percent, with
    the most significant portion of the liabilities having a
    discount rate for obligations of 5.60 percent or higher at
    December 31, 2009.

The Company determined the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets by reviewing an analysis of expected and historical
    rates of return of various asset classes based upon the current
    and long-term target asset allocation of the plan assets. The
    measurement date for the defined-benefit plans was
    December 31.

Other

The Company sponsors certain post-retirement benefit plans that
    provide medical, dental and life insurance coverage for eligible
    retirees and dependents in the United States based upon age and
    length of service. The aggregate present value of the unfunded
    accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
    $13 million and $12 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

SHAREHOLDERS’

In July 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase for retirement of up to 50 million shares of
    the Company’s common stock in open-market transactions or
    otherwise. At December 31, 2009, the Company had remaining
    authorization to repurchase up to 30 million shares. During
    2009, the Company repurchased and retired two million shares of
    Company common stock, for cash aggregating $11 million to
    offset the dilutive impact of the 2009 grant of two million
    shares of long-term stock awards. The Company repurchased and
    retired nine million common shares in 2008 and 31 million
    common shares in 2007 for cash aggregating $160 million and
    $857 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

On the basis of amounts paid (declared), cash dividends per
    common share were $.46 ($.30) in 2009, $.925 ($.93) in 2008 and
    $.91 ($.92) in 2007, respectively. In 2009, the Company

A valuation allowance of $43 million and $15 million
    was recorded at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    on certain net operating loss carryforward and other deferred
    tax asset balances that the Company believes will not be
    realized in future periods primarily due to a recent history of
    losses of certain subsidiaries.

Of the $582 million of deferred tax assets recorded at
    December 31, 2009 net of a valuation allowance,
    $432 million is anticipated to be realized through the
    future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences
    recorded as a deferred tax liability, and $150 million is
    anticipated to be realized through future gains from investments
    and other identified tax-planning strategies, including the
    potential sale of certain operating assets and through capital
    gains in the carryback period. As a result, a valuation
    allowance was not recorded on these deferred tax assets.

Of the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss and
    tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    $65 million and $9 million will expire between 2018
    and 2029 and $4 million and $13 million is unlimited,
    respectively.

A $9 million and $10 million deferred tax liability
    has been provided at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign
    subsidiaries as such earnings are intended to be repatriated in
    the foreseeable future. A tax provision has not been provided at
    December 31, 2009 for U.S. income taxes or additional
    foreign withholding taxes on approximately $100 million of
    undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that
    are considered to be permanently reinvested. It is not
    practicable to determine the amount of deferred tax liability on
    such earnings as the actual U.S. tax would depend on income
    tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution.

During 2009, the Company reversed an accrual for unrecognized

    withholding tax issue from a formerly held European company due
    to a recent favorable court decision which resulted in a
    decrease in the effective tax rate. In addition, the Company
    recorded pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill of
    $262 million ($180 million after-tax) in 2009 that
    increased the effective tax rate as a portion of the impairment
    charges did not provide a tax benefit. Excluding the effects of
    these items, the Company’s effective tax rate in 2009 was
    approximately 37 percent.

During 2008, the Company made a substantial repatriation of
    low-taxed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to fully
    utilize the existing foreign tax credit carryforward by
    December 31, 2008. Although the majority of the current
    U.S. tax on this substantial repatriation was offset by the
    foreign tax credit carryforward, the Company’s tax expense
    was increased by approximately $65 million. Also during
    2008, the Company recorded pre-tax impairment charges for
    goodwill and other intangibles of $467 million
    ($445 million after-tax) that significantly increased the
    Company’s effective tax rate as the majority of the
    impairment charges did not provide a tax benefit. Excluding the
    effects of the substantial repatriation of low-taxed earnings
    and the impairment charges, the Company’s effective tax
    rate in 2008 was approximately 33 percent.

Income taxes paid were $25 million, $117 million and
    $363 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted accounting
    guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    and recorded the cumulative effect of adopting such guidance as

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal
    jurisdiction, and various local, state and foreign
    jurisdictions. The Company continues to participate in the
    Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). CAP is a
    real-time audit of the U.S. Federal income tax return that
    allows the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), working
    in conjunction with the Company, to determine tax return
    compliance with the U.S. Federal tax law prior to filing
    the return. This program provides the Company with greater
    certainty about its tax liability for a given year within
    months, rather than years, of filing its annual tax return and
    greatly reduces the need for recording U.S. Federal
    unrecognized tax benefits. The IRS has completed their
    examination of the Company’s consolidated U.S. Federal
    tax returns through 2008. With few exceptions, the Company is no
    longer subject to state or foreign income tax examinations on
    filed returns for years before 2000.

As a result of tax audit closings, settlements and the
    expiration of applicable statutes of limitations in various
    jurisdictions within the next 12 months, the Company
    anticipates that it is reasonably possible the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately
    $9 million.

    dividends prior to vesting should be considered participating
    securities. The Company has granted restricted stock awards that
    contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends on unvested shares;
    such unvested restricted stock awards are considered
    participating securities. As participating securities, the
    unvested shares are required to be included in the calculation
    of the Company’s basic earnings per common share, using the
    “two-class method.” The two-class method of computing
    earnings per common share is an allocation method that
    calculates earnings per share for each class of common stock and
    participating security according to dividends declared and
    participation rights in undistributed earnings. Unvested
    restricted stock awards were previously included in the
    Company’s diluted share calculation using the treasury
    stock method. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, the Company allocated dividends to the unvested

restricted stock awards (participating securities); in 2007, the
    Company also allocated income to the unvested stock awards.

At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company did not
    include any common shares related to the Zero Coupon Convertible
    Senior Notes (“Notes”) in the calculation of diluted
    earnings per common share, as the price of the Company’s
    common stock at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 did not
    exceed the equivalent accreted value of the Notes.

Additionally, 36 million common shares, 31 million
    common shares and 19 million common shares for 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, related to stock options were excluded
    from the computation of diluted earnings per common share due to
    their antidilutive effect.

Common shares outstanding included on the Company’s balance
    sheet and for the calculation of earnings per common share do
    not include unvested stock awards (nine million and eight
    million common shares at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively); shares outstanding for legal requirements
    included all common shares that have voting rights (including
    unvested stock awards).

OTHER
    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary
    course of business.

Early in 2003, a suit was brought against the Company and a
    number of its insulation installation companies in the federal
    court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleging that certain practices
    violate provisions of federal and state antitrust laws. The
    plaintiff publicized the lawsuit with a press release and stated
    in that release that the U.S. Department of Justice was
    investigating the business practices of the Company’s
    insulation installation companies. Although the Company was
    unaware of any investigation at that time, the Company was later
    advised that an investigation had been commenced but was
    subsequently closed without any enforcement action recommended.
    Two additional lawsuits were subsequently brought in Virginia
    making similar claims under the antitrust laws. Both of these
    lawsuits have since been dismissed without any payment or
    requirement for any change in business practices.

During the second half of 2004, the same counsel who commenced
    the initial action in Atlanta filed six additional lawsuits on
    behalf of several of Masco’s competitors in the insulation
    installation business. The plaintiffs then dismissed all of
    these lawsuits and, represented by the same counsel, filed
    another action in the same federal court as a putative class
    action against the Company, a number of its insulation
    installation companies and certain of their suppliers. All of
    the Company’s suppliers, who were co-defendants in this
    lawsuit, have settled this case. On February 9, 2009, the
    federal court in Atlanta issued an Opinion in which the Court
    certified a class of 377 insulation contractors. In its Opinion,
    the Court also ruled on various other motions. Two additional
    lawsuits, seeking class action status and alleging
    anticompetitive conduct, were filed against the Company and a
    number of its insulation suppliers. One of these lawsuits was
    filed in a Florida state court and has been dismissed by the
    court with prejudice. The other lawsuit was filed in federal
    court in northern California and was subsequently transferred to
    federal court in Atlanta, Georgia. A motion for judgment on the
    pleadings is pending in this action. The Company is vigorously
    defending the pending cases. Based upon the advice of its
    outside counsel, the Company believes that the conduct of the
    Company and its insulation installation companies, which has
    been the subject of the above-described lawsuits, has not
    violated any antitrust laws. The Company is unable at this time
    to reliably estimate any potential liability which might occur
    from an adverse judgment. There cannot be any assurance that the
    Company will ultimately prevail in the remaining lawsuits or, if
    unsuccessful, that the ultimate liability would not be material
    and would

    CONTINGENCIES – (Continued)

not have a material adverse effect on its businesses or the
    methods used by its insulation installation companies in doing
    business.

In 2004, the Company learned that European governmental
    authorities were investigating possible anticompetitive business
    practices relating to the plumbing and heating industries in
    Europe. The investigations involve a number of European
    companies, including certain of the Company’s European
    manufacturing divisions and a number of other large businesses.
    As part of its broadened governance activities, the Company,
    with the assistance of its outside counsel, completed a review
    of the competition practices of its European divisions,
    including those in the plumbing and heating industries, and the
    Company is cooperating fully with the European governmental
    authorities. Several private antitrust lawsuits have been filed
    in the United States as putative class actions against, among
    others, the Company and certain of the other companies being
    investigated relating to the defendants’ plumbing
    operations. These appear to be an outgrowth of the
    investigations being conducted by European governmental
    authorities. These lawsuits have been dismissed. Based upon the
    advice of its outside counsel, the review of the competition
    practices of its European divisions referred to above and other
    factors, the Company believes that it will not incur material
    liability as a result of the matters that are the subject of
    these investigations.

Warranty

Certain of the Company’s products and product finishes and
    services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in
    material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to
    the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any
    changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
    servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted
    accordingly.

Changes in the Company’s warranty liability were as
    follows, in millions:

Investments

With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity
    funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2009, commitments
    to contribute up to $37 million of additional capital to
    such funds representing the Company’s aggregate capital
    commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to
    date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional
    capital contributions to certain of its private equity funds
    upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. The
    Company has no control over when or if the capital calls will
    occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in
    an increase in the carrying value of the Company’s
    investment in the private equity fund when paid.

Other
    Matters

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and
    customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries
    in which it operates. Such indemnifications include customer
    claims against builders for issues relating to the
    Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with
    divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally
    provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to
    various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal
    and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and
    asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material
    amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the
    probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately
    records an estimated liability when probable.

Controls
    and Procedures.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of
    its disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange
    Act

Rules 13a-15(b)

and

15d-15(b)

as
    of December 31, 2009. Based on this evaluation, the
    Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting.

Management’s report on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) is included in this Report under
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under
    the heading, “Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting.” The report of our independent
    registered public accounting firm is also included under
    Item 8, under the heading, “Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm.”

(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

The Company continued a phased deployment of new Enterprise
    Resource Planning (“ERP”) systems at Masco Builder
    Cabinet Group and Masco Contractor Services, two of the
    Company’s larger business units. These new systems
    represent process improvement initiatives and are not in
    response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
    However, these business process initiatives are significant in
    scale and complexity and will result in modifications to certain
    internal controls. These systems are designed, in part, to
    enhance the overall system of internal control over financial
    reporting through further automation and integration of various
    business processes.
