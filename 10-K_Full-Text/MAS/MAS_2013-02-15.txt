Masco Corporation

2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K




PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Masco Corporation
manufactures, distributes and installs home improvement and building products, with an emphasis on brand-name consumer products and services holding leadership positions. We are among the largest manufacturers in North America of a number of home
improvement and building products, including faucets, cabinets, architectural coatings and windows, and we are one of the largest installers of insulation for new home construction. We provide broad product offerings in a variety of styles and price
points and distribute products through multiple channels, including directly to homebuilders and wholesale and retail channels. Approximately 78 percent of our 2012 sales were generated by our North American operations.

In 2012, new home construction increased approximately 25 percent; however, with the significant decline in new home construction over the past
several years, the demand for new homes remains below the historic average. Consumer spending for big ticket home improvements continued to be depressed during the year. Additionally, we experienced a negative mix shift for certain products, with
consumers demanding more value-priced products. All of these factors continue to impact our results.

Throughout
2012, we have pursued four strategic initiatives to improve our performance. First, we are extending and expanding our product leadership positions by leveraging our brands and introducing innovative new and improved products. We are gaining share
in our North American plumbing business with our DELTA

®

, PEERLESS

®

, and BRIZO

®

brands, and internationally
with our Hansgrohe

®

products. We continued to extend the Delta and Peerless brands to additional product categories,
introducing toilets in 2012, and we also pursued international opportunities for these brands. In 2012, Masco Contractor Services achieved share gains in insulation for new home construction, retrofit and commercial channels. Behr

®

paint experienced growth in the Pro

®

paint segment, and is pursuing international opportunities. Milgard, our manufacturer of windows in the western U.S., and our U.K. Window Group continue to gain share
in their markets.

Our second strategic initiative is to improve our performance by reducing costs, primarily through supply chain
savings, and implementing lean principles and production process improvements. Over the last several years, we have closed 33 facilities and reduced headcount by over 31,000, enabling us to achieve significant fixed cost reductions. We have improved
our global supply chain by leveraging our size to realize purchasing cost savings, simplifying the purchasing process, and coordinating logistical operations. At several of our businesses, we have implemented new ERP systems to improve operations,
including customer service and inventory management, and to reduce costs.

Our third strategic initiative is to improve our
under-performing businesses, particularly our Cabinet and Installation businesses, which were impacted by the downturn in new home construction and the reduced consumer spending for big ticket home improvement items. While our Cabinet businesses,
including our European operations, continue to experience challenges, in 2012 this segment significantly reduced its operating losses compared to 2011. In our Installation segment, we experienced significant operating profit improvement in 2012,
generated by incremental new home construction activity, cost reductions from lean processes, leveraging of our new ERP system, and supply chain savings.

Our fourth strategic initiative is strengthening our balance sheet through net debt reduction and maintaining strong liquidity. This year, we reduced our debt by approximately $400 million through the retirement of
notes due in July. We had approximately $1.4 billion of cash at December 31, 2012.

We believe that we have managed our businesses
successfully through the economic crisis and subsequent recession of recent years. We believe that our focus on our strategic initiatives of expanding our market leadership positions, reducing costs, improving our underperforming businesses



and strengthening our balance sheet will improve our performance and position us well as the economy recovers.

Our Business Segments

We report our financial results in five business segments
aggregated by similarity in products and services. The following table sets forth the contribution of our segments to net sales and operating profit (loss) for the three years ended December 31, 2012. Additional financial information concerning
our operations by segment and by geographic regions, as well as general corporate expense, net, as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2012, is set forth in Note O to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8
of this Report.

(1)

Amounts exclude discontinued operations.

(2)

Operating profit (loss) is before general corporate expense, net, and gain on sale of fixed assets, net.

(3)

Operating profit (loss) is before net charges of $77 million regarding the 2012 litigation settlement, primarily in the Installation and Other Services segment and $9 million
regarding the 2011 litigation settlements in the Cabinets and Related Products and the Other Specialty Products segments.

(4)

Operating profit (loss) includes impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets as follows: For 2012 – Other Specialty Products – $42 million. For 2011
– Cabinets and Related Products – $44 million; Plumbing Products – $1 million; Decorative Architectural Products – $75 million; and Other Specialty Products – $374 million. For 2010 – Plumbing Products – $1
million; and Installation and Other Services – $697 million.

All of our operating segments, except the Plumbing
Products segment, normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters, corresponding with the peak season for new home construction and repair and remodel activity.

Cabinets and Related Products

In
North America, we manufacture and sell value-priced, stock and semi-custom assembled cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range



of styles and price points to address consumer preferences. We have also expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the manufacture and sale of kitchen countertops, as well as an
integrated bathroom vanity and countertop solution. In Europe, we manufacture and sell assembled and ready-to-assemble kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home entertainment cabinetry. These products are sold in the United States and in Europe
under a number of trademarks. Our KRAFTMAID

®

and TVILUM

®

brands are sold primarily to dealers, home centers and mass merchants and our MERILLAT

®

, MOORES™ and QUALITY CABINETS™ brands are sold primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both home improvement and new home construction. Cabinet sales
are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending, particularly spending for major kitchen and bathroom renovation projects. A significant portion of our sales for home improvement are made
through home center retailers.

New home construction has declined significantly over the past several years, and our Cabinet segment has
been particularly affected by this downturn. This segment has also been negatively affected by a downturn in repair and remodel, particularly by consumers who continue to defer expenditures for big-ticket items and, when purchasing, are demanding
more value-priced products. Although home construction is improving and is expected to continue to improve, the demand for new homes remains below the historic average. The size of new homes has decreased and demand has increased for multi-family
housing units, which are smaller than single-family housing units and require fewer cabinets for the kitchen and bathrooms. Further, consumer spending for big ticket home improvements continues to be depressed. In response, we have implemented a
strategy to increase our sales in this segment through brand building, new product introductions and product innovation. We have also reviewed our cost structure, which resulted in the closure of several manufacturing plants in this segment and
exited our North American ready-to-assemble cabinet product line. Additionally, we continue to focus on improving cabinet production efficiencies at lower volumes.

The cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States and Europe is highly competitive, with several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors. In recent years, we have experienced significant
competition in the form of promotional pricing, discounts, and new product offerings by our competitors, which have impacted the segment’s results of operations. We are also experiencing significant competition from foreign manufacturers,
particularly in our European cabinet operations. In addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality, responsiveness to customer needs, product features and selection. Our North American competitors
include American Woodmark Corporation and Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.

Plumbing Products

The businesses in our Plumbing Products segment sell a wide variety of faucet and showering devices that are manufactured by or
for us. The majority of our plumbing products are sold in North America and Europe under the brand names DELTA

®

, PEERLESS

®

,
HANSGROHE

®

, AXOR

®

, BRIZO

®

, BRASSTECH

®

, BRISTAN™, GINGER

®

, NEWPORT BRASS

®

, ALSONS

®

and PLUMB
SHOP

®

. Our products include single-handle and double-handle faucets, showerheads, handheld showers and valves, and, in
2012, we introduced toilets. These products are sold to major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors that, in turn, sell our products to plumbers, building contractors, remodelers, smaller retailers and others.

Other plumbing products manufactured and sold by us include products branded as AQUA GLASS

®

,
MIROLIN

®

and AMERICAN SHOWER & BATH™ such brands use innovex acrylic and gelcoat for tub and shower systems,
bath and shower enclosure units, shower trays and laundry tubs, which are sold primarily to wholesale plumbing distributors and home center retailers for home improvement and new home construction in North America. Our spas are manufactured and sold
under HOT SPRING

®

, CALDERA

®

and other trademarks directly to independent dealers. Major competitors include Kohler, Aquatic, Maax and Jacuzzi. We sell HÜPPE

®

shower enclosures through



wholesale channels primarily in Western Europe. HERITAGE™ ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally sold in the United Kingdom directly to selected retailers.

Also included in the Plumbing Products segment are brass and copper plumbing system components and other plumbing specialties,
which are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware wholesalers and to home center retailers, hardware stores, building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These products are marketed in North America for the wholesale trade under the
BRASSCRAFT

®

and BRASSTECH

®

trademarks and for the “do-it-yourself” consumers under the BRASSCRAFT MASTER PLUMBER

®

and PLUMB SHOP

®

trademarks, and are
also sold under private label.

We believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in North America and Europe, with
American Standard, Kohler, Moen and Pfister as major brand competitors. We also have several European competitors, primarily in Germany, including Friedrich Grohe. We face significant competition from private label products (including house brands
sold by certain of our customers). Many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressures on price, particularly in the emerging markets we are
entering. The businesses in our Plumbing Products segment source products from Asia and manufacture products in the United States, Europe and Asia. Certain businesses in our Plumbing Product segment are also experiencing a shift in the mix of
products we sell toward more value-priced or opening price point products, which impacts our profitability. In addition to price, we believe that competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation, product quality, product
innovation and features, and breadth of product offering.

A substantial portion of our plumbing products contain brass, the major
components of which are copper and zinc. We have encountered price volatility for brass, brass components and any components containing copper and zinc; therefore, we have implemented a hedging strategy to minimize the impact of this volatility.
Legislation enacted in California, Vermont and Maryland mandates new standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold in those states. Federal legislation mandating a national standard for lead content in plumbing products will become
effective in January 2014. Faucet and water supply valve manufacturers, including our plumbing product companies, will be required to obtain adequate supplies of lead-free brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets
and certain of our plumbing products. Over the last several years, our Delta Faucet business introduced the DIAMOND™ SEAL TECHNOLOGY, which reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet, simplifies installation and satisfies
legislation regarding the acceptable lead content in plumbing products.

Installation and Other Services

Our Installation and Other Services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily to the new home
construction market, and, to a lesser extent, the retrofit and commercial construction markets, throughout the United States. In addition to insulation, we sell installed gutters, after-paint products, garage doors and fireplaces. The installation
and distribution of insulation comprised approximately eleven percent, nine percent and nine percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Installed building products are supplied primarily to custom and production
homebuilders by our network of branches located across the United States. Our distributed products include insulation, insulation accessories, roofing and gutters, among others. Distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers
(including lumber yards) from distribution centers in various parts of the United States.

There has been a significant decrease in
demand in the new home construction industry over the past several years. Additionally, the size of new homes has decreased, and demand has increased for multi-family housing units such as apartments and condominiums, which are often smaller than
single-family housing units. The effect of these trends has resulted in the use of less insulation. In response,



we have expanded our ability to serve the residential retrofit and light commercial markets. Within the Installation and Other Services segment, we have several initiatives related to improved
residential energy efficiency, including retrofit installation services (primarily insulation) delivered directly to homeowners, as well as through retailers and dealer outlets.

In addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of installation service. We
believe that we are the largest national provider of installed insulation in the new home construction industry in the United States. Our competitors include several regional contractors, as well as numerous local contractors and lumber yards. We
believe that our capabilities and financial resources are substantial compared to regional and local contractors.

Decorative Architectural
Products

We produce architectural coatings including paints, primers, specialty paint products, stains and
waterproofing products. The products are sold in the United States, Canada, China, Mexico and South America under the brand names
BEHR

®

and
KILZ

®

to “do-it-yourself” and professional customers through home centers, paint stores and other retailers. Net
sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 20 percent of our consolidated net sales in each of 2012, 2011 and 2010. Competitors in the architectural coatings market include large national and international brands such as Benjamin Moore,
Glidden, Olympic, Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Zinsser, as well as many regional and other national brands. In addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality, technology and product innovation,
customer service and brand reputation. In 2012, we enhanced our paint formulations with a zero-VOC PREMIUM PLUS

®

paint and
greater stain-blocking properties in our PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA

®

paint.

Our BEHR products are sold through The Home Depot, this segment’s and our largest customer. The loss of this segment’s sales to The Home
Depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole.

Titanium dioxide
is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint. The industry has experienced cost increases for titanium dioxide as a result of surges in global demand and production capacity limitations, which has impacted our operating results in this segment.
Petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings. Significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas lead to higher raw material costs (e.g., for resins, solvents and packaging, as well as titanium dioxide),
which can adversely affect the segment’s results of operations.

Our Decorative Architectural Products segment
also includes LIBERTY

®

and BRAINERD

®

branded cabinet, door, window and other hardware, which is manufactured for us and sold to home centers, other retailers, original equipment manufacturers and
wholesale markets. Key competitors in North America include Amerock, Top Knobs and house brands. Decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under the brand names DELTA

®

, FRANKLIN BRASS

®

and DECOR BATHWARE

®

to distributors, home centers and other retailers. Competitors include Moen, Gatco and house brands sold by certain of our
customers.

Other Specialty Products

We manufacture and sell vinyl, fiberglass and aluminum windows and patio doors, as well as the ESSENCE SERIES

®

windows and doors, which combines a wood interior with a fiberglass exterior, under the MILGARD

®

brand name for home improvements and new home construction, principally in the western United States. MILGARD products are sold primarily through dealers and, to a
lesser extent, directly to production and custom homebuilders and through lumber yards and home centers. This segment’s competitors in North America include national brands, such as Jeld-Wen, Marvin, Pella and Andersen, and numerous regional
brands.

In the United Kingdom, we manufacture and sell windows, related products and components under several brand names including
GRIFFIN™, CAMBRIAN™, PREMIER™ and DURAFLEX™.



Sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the repair and remodeling markets, although our DURAFLEX products are also sold to other window fabricators. United Kingdom competitors
include many small and mid-sized firms and a few large, vertically integrated competitors. In addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and product quality.

We manufacture and sell a complete line of manual and electric staple gun tackers, staples and other fastening tools under the
brand names ARROW

®

and POWERSHOT

®

. We sell these products through various distribution channels including home centers and other retailers and wholesalers. Our principal North American competitor in
this product line is Stanley Black & Decker.

Additional Information

We hold U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing processes. As
a manufacturer and distributor of brand name products, we view our trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important, but do not believe that there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of such rights that would have a material adverse
effect on our present business as a whole.

We are subject to U.S. and foreign government regulations, particularly those pertaining to
health and safety (including protection of employees and consumers), climate disruption and environmental issues. In addition to our responsibilities for environmental remediation, our businesses are subject to other requirements regarding
protection of the environment and worker health and safety. Our businesses are subject to requirements relating to the emission of volatile organic compounds which may impact our sourcing of particleboard, require that we install special equipment
in manufacturing facilities or that we reformulate paint products. As described above, our Plumbing Products segment is subject to restrictions on lead content in some of its products. Compliance with such laws and regulations could significantly
affect product performance as well as our production costs. We monitor applicable laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, climate disruption and worker health and safety, and incur ongoing expense relating to compliance.
We do not expect compliance with the federal, state and local regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety, will result in material
capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position.

We do not consider backlog orders to be
material in any of our segments.

At December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 30,000 people. We have generally experienced
satisfactory relations with our employees.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

There are a number
of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results.



We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently
believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant portion of
our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity, both of which remain at low levels.

A significant
portion of our business relies on home improvement (including repair and remodel) and new home construction activity, principally in North America and Europe. The economic decline in the past four years adversely affected our home improvement
businesses. Persistent low levels of consumer confidence and depressed home prices, and elevated levels of unemployment and underemployment, have limited consumers’ discretionary spending and have made consumers reluctant to make investments in
existing homes, including large kitchen and bath remodeling projects. The significant number of households with negative equity in their homes, and more conservative residential lending practices for home equity loans often used to finance repairs
and remodeling, have limited the ability of consumers to finance home improvements. Additionally, sales of existing homes, which significantly impact our home improvement business, continue to be below normal levels. New home construction is
cyclical in nature. Although home construction is improving and is expected to continue to improve, the demand for new homes remains below the historic average, and stringent standards continue to be imposed on homebuyers seeking financing.

We cannot predict the type or timing of a recovery in home improvement, nor the strength of a recovery in new home construction.
Depressed consumer spending for home improvements and continued below-normal levels of new home construction may adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.

Continued uncertainty regarding an economic recovery could result in our taking additional significant non-cash charges, which may reduce our financial resources and flexibility and could negatively
affect our earnings and reduce shareholders’ equity.

We have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets related
to prior business combinations on our balance sheet. The valuation of these assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses. In recent years, we have recorded significant non-cash impairment charges for
financial investments, goodwill and other intangible assets. We have also recorded valuation allowances related to our deferred tax assets. A further decline in the expectation of our future performance, or a further deterioration in expectations
regarding the timing and the extent of the recovery of new home construction and home improvement, may cause us to recognize additional non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets or other
long-lived assets, which are not determinable at this time. If the value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, our earnings and shareholders’ equity would be adversely affected.

Further, our credit agreement contains financial covenants we must comply with, including covenants regarding limits on our debt to total
capitalization ratio. If we are required to record additional non-cash impairment charges, our shareholders’ equity would be reduced, and our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement may be limited. In the past we have negotiated
amendments to our credit agreement to allow for the add-back to shareholders’ equity for impairment charges we have taken. There can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend our credit agreement, that alternative
financing would be available on acceptable terms and at acceptable rates, or that we would be permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements.



If we do not maintain strong brands or respond to changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices,
we could lose share and our results could be adversely affected.

Our competitive advantage is due, in part, to our ability to
maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products. While we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness, these initiatives may not be successful. The uncertainties associated with developing
and introducing new and improved products, such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling these products, may impact the success of our product introductions. If our new or improved
products do not gain widespread acceptance, we could lose share, which could negatively impact our operating results.

Further, the
volatile and challenging economic environment of recent years has caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and changes in the business models and strategies of our customers. Such shifts have altered the quantity, type and
prices of products demanded by the end-consumer and our customers. For example, the size of new homes has decreased, and demand has increased for multi-family housing units such as apartments and condominiums, which are often smaller than
single-family housing units. The effect of these trends has resulted in smaller kitchens and smaller and fewer bathrooms, each with fewer cabinets and faucets, as well as the use of less insulation. We have experienced a negative mix shift for
certain products, with consumers demanding more value-priced products and fewer higher margin products. All of these shifts have negatively impacted our sales and profitability, and it is uncertain whether these shifts represent long-term changes in
consumer preferences.

Consumers are increasingly using the internet and mobile technology to research home improvement products and
enhance their purchasing and ownership experience for these products. E-commerce is a rapidly developing area, and development of a successful e-commerce strategy involves significant time and resources. If we are unable to successfully execute our
e-commerce strategies, our brands may lose share.

If we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing consumer
preferences and purchasing practices, our relationships with our customers could be harmed, the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations could be negatively affected.

Our actions to improve our underperforming businesses have been costly and may not be effective.

The downturn in home improvement and new home construction activity in the past four years has impacted our results, particularly in our Cabinets
and Related Products and our Installation and Other Services segments and in our European cabinet businesses. Further, the economic decline has also negatively affected certain businesses in our Plumbing Products segment. There is no assurance that
our efforts to improve these underperforming businesses through initiatives to reduce costs and increase sales will be successful. Our cost-saving initiatives, including rationalizing our businesses, closing plants, reducing headcount and
implementing new systems, have been complex, time-consuming and expensive. The consolidation of our North American Cabinet businesses, in particular, has involved the integration of multiple manufacturing processes and information technology
platforms. If we cannot successfully implement these cost-saving initiatives, we may not fully achieve their anticipated benefits.

Our
strategy to increase our sales in the Cabinets and Related Products segment through brand building, new product introductions and product innovation requires time to develop, implement and assess. Further, this segment faces significant pricing and
promotional pressures. We have also taken several actions to improve the operations of our European cabinet businesses. If we cannot successfully implement these initiatives at all of our Cabinet businesses, our results of operations may continue to
be negatively impacted.



Further, if the eventual economic recovery is fast-paced and robust, we may not be able to ramp up our
reduced manufacturing and installation capacity in a timely fashion, and our ability to respond to increased demand could be limited, which could result in lost share and, ultimately, could negatively impact our operating results.

We rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels.

The size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated or
exited the business. In 2012, sales to our largest customer, The Home Depot, were $2.1 billion (approximately 28 percent of consolidated net sales). Lowe’s is our second largest customer. In 2012, sales to Lowe’s were less than ten percent
of our consolidated net sales. These home center customers may reduce the number of vendors they purchase from and can make significant changes in their volume of purchases. Additionally, home centers can significantly affect the prices we receive
for our products and services, our cost of doing business with them, and the terms and conditions on which we do business. Although homebuilders, dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services, the
loss of a substantial portion of our sales to The Home Depot or the loss of our sales to Lowe’s would have a material adverse effect on our business.

As some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers, conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur, which could impact our results of operations. In
addition, we may undermine the business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our customers. In addition, our large
retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity, which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may diminish our ability to leverage economies of scale.

We face significant competition.

Our products and services face significant competition, and this competition is further intensified during economic downturns. We believe that we
compete on the basis of price, product and service quality, brand reputation, customer service and product features and innovation. Some home centers are increasing their purchases of select products in our segments directly from low-cost foreign
manufacturers for sale as private label and house brand merchandise. Additionally, home centers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers, are increasingly marketing directly to professional
contractors and installers, which may impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers.

In our other distribution channels, we compete with foreign manufacturers in a variety of our product groups. These foreign manufacturers are putting downward pressures on price, particularly in the emerging
markets we are entering. In our Cabinets and Related Products segment, we have experienced significant competition in the form of promotional pricing, discounts, and new product offerings by our competitors, which have impacted our results of
operations. In some of our segments, we are also experiencing a shift in the mix of products we sell toward more value-priced or opening price point products, which may impact our ability to maintain or gain share and our profitability.

Our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries and to grow our businesses depends upon successfully maintaining our
relationships with major customers, implementing growth strategies and entering new geographic areas, including successful international penetration, capitalizing on and strengthening our brands, managing our cost structure, accommodating shorter
life-cycles for our products, and developing and innovating products, none of which is assured.



Increased commodity costs and limited availability of commodities could affect our operating results.

We buy various commodities to manufacture our products, including, among others, wood, brass (made of copper and zinc), titanium
dioxide and resins. Fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase our costs to manufacture our products. Further, increases in energy costs not only increase our production costs, but also the cost to transport our
products, each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.

It has been, and likely will continue to
be, difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs. Our existing arrangements with customers, competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us
unable to adjust selling prices. If we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. If we
are able to increase our selling prices, sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of share, particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices. When commodity prices decline, we may receive pressure
from our customers to reduce prices for our products and services.

To reduce the price volatility associated with certain anticipated
commodity purchases, we use derivative instruments, including commodity futures and swaps. We may incur net substantial costs as part of our strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to
purchase these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

We are dependent on third-party suppliers and manufacturers, and the loss of a key supplier or manufacturer could negatively affect our operating results.

Our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of products and components from manufacturers
and other suppliers. We rely heavily or, in certain cases, exclusively, on outside suppliers for some of our products and key components. Failure by our suppliers to provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms, or to comply with
legal requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. Resourcing these products and components to another supplier could take time and involve significant costs. Accordingly, the loss of a key
supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers, could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operating results.

Further, we manufacture products in Asia and source products and components from third parties in Asia. The distances involved in these arrangements, together with differences in business practices, shipping and
delivery requirements, the limited number of suppliers, and laws and regulations, have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain, the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production
scheduling. If we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain, our operating results could be negatively affected.

International
political, monetary, economic and social developments affect our business.

Over 20 percent of our sales are made outside of
North America (principally in Europe) and are transacted in currencies other than U.S. dollars (principally the euro and the British pound sterling). Increased international sales make up an important part of our future strategic plans. In
addition, we manufacture products in Asia and source products and components from third parties in Asia. Our international business faces risks associated with changes in political, monetary, economic and social environments, labor conditions and
practices, the laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. U.S. laws and regulations affecting activities of U.S. companies doing
business abroad,



including tax laws, laws regulating various business practices, and trade regulations which may include duties and tariffs can also impact our international business. Our international operating
results may be influenced by economic conditions in Europe, including uncertainty regarding the European sovereign debt crisis, and competitive pricing pressures on certain products. The financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is
affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance.

We have investments in financial assets, including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk.

We continue to reduce our investment in private equity funds. Since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds, they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their
nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided
by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation.

Claims and
litigation could be costly.

We are, from time to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings
that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract disputes, automobile liability and other personal injury claims, warranty disputes, environmental claims or
proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions.

We are subject
to product safety regulations, recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly to defend or manage. Also, we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to
provide us with products or components for products that we sell. Due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to
limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.

We have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon
claims for antitrust violations, product liability and wage and hour issues. We have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases. Due to their scope and complexity, however, these lawsuits can be particularly costly to defend
and resolve, and we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of these types of lawsuits.

Increasingly, our
homebuilder customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with these customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various
liabilities. These claims, often asserted several years after completion of construction, can result in complex lawsuits or claims against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors, including us, and may require us to incur defense and
indemnity costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims.

Although we intend to defend all claims
and litigation matters vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter.

We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. We may elect not to obtain insurance
if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to



fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant accident, judgment, claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

See Note T to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses.

Compliance with government regulation and industry
standards could impact our capital expenditures and operating results.

We are subject to U.S. and foreign government regulations,
particularly those pertaining to health and safety (including protection of employees and consumers), climate disruption and environmental issues. In addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a
future date, even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future. Additionally, some of our products must be certified by industry organizations. Compliance with these regulations and industry standards may require us
to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing, which could adversely impact our competitive position. Further, if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards, our operating results
could be negatively affected.

The long-term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented
personnel.

To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel who have the experience,
knowledge and expertise to successfully implement our key business strategies, particularly our international business expansion and the development of e-commerce capabilities. We compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many
different industries, including large multinational firms, and we invest significant resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our
competitive position and our operating results. Further, as the housing market recovers, if we are unable to recruit, train and retain sufficient skilled labor, we may not be able to adequately satisfy increased demand for our products and services,
which could impact our operating results.

Properties.

The table below lists
our principal North American properties for segments other than Installation and Other Services.

Most of our North American facilities range from single warehouse buildings to complex manufacturing facilities. We
own most of our North American manufacturing facilities, none of which



are subject to significant encumbrances. A substantial number of our warehouse and distribution facilities are leased.

Our Installation and Other Services segment operates approximately 180 installation branch locations and approximately 70 distribution centers in the United States, most of which are leased.

The table below lists our principal properties outside of North America.

Most of our international facilities are located in China, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom. We
generally own our international manufacturing facilities, none of which are subject to significant encumbrances. A substantial number of our international warehouse and distribution facilities are leased.

Our corporate headquarters are located in Taylor, Michigan and are owned by us. We own an additional building near our corporate headquarters that
is used by our Masco Technical Services (research and development) department.

Each of our operating divisions assesses the
manufacturing, distribution and other facilities needed to meet its operating requirements. Our buildings, machinery and equipment have been generally well maintained and are in good operating condition. We believe our facilities have sufficient
capacity and are adequate for our production and distribution requirements.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

The New York Stock Exchange is the principal market on which our common stock is traded. The following table indicates the high and low sales prices
of our common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange and the cash dividends declared per common share for the periods indicated:

On January 31, 2013, there were approximately 5,014 holders of record of our common stock.

We expect that our practice of paying quarterly dividends on our common stock will continue, although the payment of future dividends is at the
discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

We grant equity under our 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2012 concerning the 2005 Plan, which was approved by our
stockholders. We do not have any equity compensation plans that have not been approved by stockholders.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

The following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and
constitute “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,”
“believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “assume,” “seek,” “appear,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “forecast” and similar references to future periods. These
views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. We caution you against relying on any of these
forward-looking statements. In addition to the various factors included in the “Executive Level Overview,” “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and “Outlook for the Company” sections, our future performance may
be affected by our reliance on new home construction and home improvement, our reliance on key customers, the cost and availability of raw materials, shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices, our ability to improve our underperforming
businesses and our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries. These and other factors are discussed in detail in Item 1A “Risk “Factors” of this Report. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Report
speaks only as of the date on which it was made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation
to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Executive Level Overview

We manufacture, distribute and install home improvement and building products. These products are sold for home improvement and new
home construction through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, homebuilders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer.

2012 Results.

Net sales were positively affected by increased new home construction and repair and remodel (except for
big ticket items) in the U.S., partially offset by slowing economic conditions in Europe and a stronger U.S. dollar. Our results of operations were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and
most of our businesses were positively affected by the benefits associated with the business rationalizations and cost savings initiatives that we have implemented over the last several years.

Our Cabinets and Related Products segment continues to be negatively affected by continuing competitive market conditions in repair and remodel in
the U.S. and softness in Europe. Our Plumbing Products segment results were positively affected by the benefits of increased sales volume of our North American operations partially offset by lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix
related to our international operations. The Decorative Architectural Products segment was positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and lower program costs. The Installation and Other Services
segment was positively affected by increased sales volume. The Other Specialty Products segment was positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, partially offset by the exit of certain geographies.
The Other Specialty Products segment was also negatively affected by incremental warranty expenses of $12 million and the impairment of a registered trademark of $42 million.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review our estimates
and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition and Receivables

We recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. We record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of material and labor
incurred in the Installation and Other Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising
arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. In addition, we monitor our customer
receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on-going basis. During downturns in our markets, declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we
have incurred bad debt expense related to customer defaults. Our bad debt expense was $14 million, $12 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Inventories

We record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to
the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences
between estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates.

Financial Investments

We follow accounting guidance that defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities. This guidance defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” Further, it defines a fair value hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities; Level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data; and Level 3 inputs as unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or
estimation.



If applicable, we record investments in available-for-sale securities at fair value, and unrealized
gains or losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect, through shareholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet.

In the past, we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates
which are reset every 7, 28 or 35 days. At December 31, 2012, our investment in auction rate securities was $22 million; we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007. The fair value of auction rate securities is
estimated, on a recurring basis, using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). If we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 75 basis points, the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately $1
million.

We have maintained investments in a number of private equity funds, which aggregated $69 million at December 31, 2012. We
carry our investments in private equity funds and other private investments at cost. It is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds and other private investments because there are no quoted market prices, and
sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund. These investments are evaluated, on a non-recurring basis, for potential other-than-temporary impairment when impairment
indicators are present, or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements used to
evaluate impairment are a Level 3 input.

Impairment indicators we consider include the following: whether there has been a significant
deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment; a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in
which the investment operates; industry and sector performance; current equity and credit market conditions; and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. We also consider specific adverse conditions related
to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund, including industry and sector performance. The significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential other-than-temporary impairment include current economic conditions,
market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in residential and commercial construction, bio-technology, health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds’ investments operate.

At December 31, 2012, we have investments in 15 venture capital funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $16 million. The venture capital
funds invest in start-up or smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors. At December 31, 2012, we also have investments in 21 buyout funds, with an aggregate
carrying value of $53 million. The buyout funds invest in later-stage, established businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector.

Since there is no active trading market for these investments, they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial
leverage, than other financial investments. The timing of distributions from the funds, which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments, as well as the funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash,
can be difficult to predict. As a result, the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter. Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments or new
information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation.

We record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be other-than-temporary.



Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible
assets. In the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a
discounted cash flow method. We selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants. We have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of
goodwill at the operating segment level, as defined by accounting guidance. Our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information, including five-year forecasts, is available.

Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including
long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. Our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While we
believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes. In estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year
forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five-year forecast. We generally develop these forecasts based
upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated housing starts and estimated repair and remodel activity.

In 2012, we utilized estimated housing starts, from independent industry sources, growing from current levels to 1.5 million units in 2017 (terminal growth year) and operating profit margins improving to
approximate historical levels for those business units by 2017 (terminal growth year). We utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9.5 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash
flows. In 2012, due to market conditions and based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses, we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 11 percent to 13 percent for most of our reporting units.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than
the carrying values. Any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill.

If the
carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting
unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

In 2012, we did not
recognize any non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill.

A ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting
units at December 31, 2012 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any additional business unit.

We review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the
reporting unit. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to
the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term. In



2012, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $42 million ($27 million, after tax) attributable to our Other Specialty Products segment.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate
the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.

Stock-Based Compensation

Our 2005 Plan provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various forms to employees and non-employee Directors. At December 31, 2012, outstanding stock-based incentives were in the form of
long-term stock awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights.

Long-Term Stock Awards

We grant long-term stock awards to key employees and non-employee Directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we
generally continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market. We measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date. There was $72 million (8 million
common shares) of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at December 31, 2012, which was included as a reduction of common stock and paid-in capital. Effective January 1, 2010, the vesting period for stock
awards awarded after January 1, 2010 is five years. For stock awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically five to ten years, or for executive grantees that are,
or will become, retirement-eligible during the vesting period, we recognize the expense over five years or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement. Effective January 1, 2006, we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the
vesting period of the stock awards, typically five to ten years (except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at age 65. Pre-tax
compensation expense for the annual vesting of long-term stock awards was $35 million for 2012.

Stock Options

We grant stock options to key employees. The exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date. These
options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than ten years after the grant date.

We measure compensation expense for stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We recognize this compensation expense ratably over
the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at age 65. Pre-tax compensation expense for stock options was $15 million for 2012.

We estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2012:
risk-free interest rate – 1.09%, dividend yield – 2.57%, volatility factor – 50.97% and expected option life – six years. For expense calculation purposes, the weighted average grant-date fair value of option shares granted in
2012 was $4.44 per option share.

If we increased our assumptions for the risk-free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50
percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2012 would increase by 44 percent. If we lowered our assumptions for the risk-free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair
value of stock options granted in 2012 would decrease by 55 percent.



Employee Retirement Plans

Effective January 1, 2010, we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and non-qualified
defined-benefit pension plans. As a result of this action, the liabilities for these plans were remeasured; in addition, certain assumptions appropriate for on-going plans (e.g., turnover, mortality and compensation increases) have been modified or
eliminated for the remeasurement.

Accounting for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided
in the future, based upon vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. We develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions
regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in assumptions
used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2012,
we decreased our discount rate for obligations to an average of 3.80 percent from 4.40 percent. The discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities matched to the
December 31, 2012 Towers Watson Rate Link curve. The discount rates we use for our defined-benefit pension plans ranged from 1.75 percent to 4.50 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for
obligations of 3.40 percent or higher. The assumed asset return was primarily 7.25 percent, reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.

Our net underfunded amount for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, increased to $462 million at December 31, 2012 from
$439 million at December 31, 2011, primarily due to lower rates of return in the bond market in 2012. In accordance with accounting guidance, the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2012 and 2011. Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2012 had a net gain of approximately 17 percent compared to average gains of 13 percent for the Investor Force Defined Benefit Plan Universe.

Our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $181 million at December 31, 2012 compared
with $174 million at December 31, 2011. In accordance with accounting guidance, this unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

At December 31, 2012, we reported a net liability of $643 million, of which $181 million was related to our non-qualified, supplemental
retirement plans, which are not subject to the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. In accordance with the Pension Protection Act, the Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage (“AFTAP”) for the various
defined-benefit pension plans ranges from 71 percent to 84 percent.

We expect pension expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension
plans to be $23 million in 2013 compared with $27 million in 2012. If we assumed that the future return on plan assets was one-half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points, the 2013 pension
expense would increase by $4 million. We expect pension expense for our non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $8 million in 2013 compared with $9 million in 2012.

We anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately $50 million to $60 million in 2013 to our qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit plans.



Income Taxes

The accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable
income in future periods. Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate
future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.

If, based upon
all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative
evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company’s three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we
can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a
$372 million valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than
anticipated recovery in the U.S. housing market which led to U.S. operating losses and significant U.S. goodwill impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative U.S. loss
position.

During 2012 and 2011, objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as U.S. operating losses and significant impairment
charges for U.S. goodwill in 2011 and other intangible assets, continued to outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance. As a result, we recorded increases of $65 million and $89 million in the valuation allowance related
to our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Recording the
valuation allowance does not restrict our ability to utilize the future deductions and net operating losses associated with the deferred tax assets assuming taxable income is recognized in future periods.

A rebound in the U.S. housing market from the recent historic lows and retail sales of building products improving from their current levels should
have a positive impact on our operating results in the U.S. A return to sustained profitability in the U.S. should result in objective positive evidence thereby warranting the potential reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance.

The $203 million and $156 million of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for which there is no
valuation allowance recorded, are anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities.

Should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. The
need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.

The current
accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. We believe that there is an increased potential for
volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for
uncertain tax positions to a greater extent.

While we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, amounts
asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, additional



provisions for tax-related matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or
otherwise resolved.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Warranty.

At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products, parts or
services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. Our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage, the
warranty period, historical experience specific to the nature, frequency and average cost to service the claim, along with product manufacturing metrics and industry and demographic trends.

Certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the
aforementioned factors. We believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals.

A majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail
outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us. Our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when
recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale.

We are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the
ordinary course of our business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel. When estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and
pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments. See Note T to our consolidated
financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings.

Corporate Development Strategy

Our current business strategy includes the rationalization of our business units, including consolidations, and increasing synergies among our
business units. Going forward, we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow, organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development and greenfield locations related to certain Installation
and Other Services businesses.

As part of our strategic planning, we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which
businesses may not be core to our long-term growth strategy. As a result, during 2012, we sold several business units in the Installation and Other Services segment. These businesses were related to commercial drywall installation, millwork and
framing; accordingly, we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in 2012 and 2011. See Note B to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, we have largely funded our growth
through cash provided by our operations, long-term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by the issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions.

Maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies; as a result, we have cash of approximately
$1.4 billion at December 31, 2012. Our total



debt as a percent of total capitalization was 87 percent and 84 percent at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

We maintain a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of January 10, 2014. The Credit Agreement provides for an
unsecured revolving credit facility available to us and one of our foreign subsidiaries, in U.S. dollars, European euros and certain other currencies.

We have entered into two amendments of the Credit Agreement. The amendments provided for the add-back to shareholders’ equity in our debt to capitalization covenant of certain non-cash charges, changes to the
valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in income tax expense, and certain future non-cash charges. The second amendment also revised the permitted ratio of consolidated EBITDA to the consolidated interest expense to 2.25 to 1.00
through December 31, 2012, increasing to 2.50 to 1.00 with respect to each quarter thereafter.

At December 31, 2012, we had
additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $873 million. Alternatively, at December 31, 2012, we could absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately $470 million and remain in compliance with the debt to
total capitalization covenant. We were in compliance with all Credit Agreement covenants and we had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2012.

On March 5, 2012, we issued $400 million of 5.95% Notes due March 15, 2022 (“the Notes”). Including the interest rate swap amortization, the effective interest rate for the Notes is
approximately 6.5%. The Notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at the Company’s option.

In January 2012, we repurchased
$46 million of 5.875% Notes due July 15, 2012 in open-market transactions; we paid a premium of $1 million for the repurchase. In July 2012, we retired all of our $745 million of 5.875% Notes on the scheduled retirement date.

We had cash and cash investments of approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2012. Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight
interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts, money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. While we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible
that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments.

Of the $1.4 billion and the
$1.7 billion of cash and cash investments we held at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, $572 million and $551 million, respectively, is held in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., their
repatriation into the U.S. may result in additional U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. The amount of such taxes is dependent on the income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution.

We have maintained investments in available-for-sale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds, principally as part of our tax
planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses. We determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in more liquid
available-for-sale and marketable securities to balance risk. Since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources, we have and will continue to reduce our investments in
long-term financial assets.

We utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily
related to the European euro and the U.S. dollar; commodity cost fluctuations, primarily zinc and copper; and interest rate fluctuations, primarily related to debt issuances. We review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk
management on a regular basis.

During 2012, we paid quarterly dividends of $.075 per common share.



Our working capital ratio was 1.7 to 1 and 1.5 to 1 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The increase in the working capital ratio is primarily due to the payment of $791 million of 5.875% Notes in July 2012, which were included in current liabilities at December 31, 2011, partially offset by the short-term classification of $200
million Notes due August 2013.

Cash Flows

Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions:

Our cash and cash investments decreased $305 million to $1,351 million at December 31, 2012, from $1,656
million at December 31, 2011.

Net cash provided by operations of $281 million consisted primarily of net (loss) adjusted for
non-cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $214 million, a $42 million charge for the impairment of other intangible assets, a $50 million net change in deferred taxes and other non-cash items, including
stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense related to in-store displays.

We continue to emphasize balance sheet
management, including working capital management and cash flow generation. Days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days at both December 31, 2012 and 2011, and days sales in inventories were 52 days at both December 31, 2012 and 2011.
Accounts payable days were 66 days at December 31, 2012 and 63 days at December 31, 2011; the increase in payable days is due to our improved management of accounts payable. Working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories
less accounts payable) as a percent of sales was 12.1 percent at December 31, 2012 and 12.2 percent at December 31, 2011.

Net
cash used for financing activities was $576 million, primarily due to the retirement of $791 million of 5.875% Notes due July 15, 2012, $107 million for cash dividends paid, $25 million for the settlement of interest rate swaps and $8 million
for the acquisition of our common stock to generally offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in 2012, partially offset by the issuance of Notes for $396 million, net of issuance costs.



At December 31, 2012, we had remaining authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up
to an additional 24 million shares of our common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise. We believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment
needs. We believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities.
Consistent with past practice, we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2013 to offset any dilution from long-term stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs.

Net cash used for investing activities was $27 million, and included $119 million for capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities
included primarily $67 million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and $40 million from the net sale of financial investments.

We invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity, improve customer service and support new product innovation. Capital expenditures for 2012 were $119 million, compared with $151
million for 2011 and $137 million for 2010; for 2013, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2013 acquisitions, are expected to be approximately $165 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2012 totaled $214 million, compared with
$263 million for 2011 and $279 million for 2010; for 2013, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2013 acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $210 million. Amortization expense totaled $12 million,
$17 million and $18 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with
existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor do we expect them to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations.

Consolidated Results of Operations

We report our financial results in accordance
with GAAP in the United States. However, we believe that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results
and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results.

Sales and Operations

Net sales for 2012 were $7.7 billion, which increased
four percent compared with 2011. Excluding results from acquisitions and the negative effect of currency translation, net sales increased five percent compared with 2011. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding
acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions:

Net sales for 2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume of installed products, North American plumbing
products, paints and stains, builders’ hardware and windows, which, in aggregate,



increased sales by approximately four percent compared to 2011. Net sales for 2012 were also positively affected by selling price increases, which increased sales by approximately three percent.
Net sales for 2012 were negatively affected by the planned exit of certain cabinet and window product lines in certain geographic areas. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by two percent compared to 2011.

Net sales for 2011 were adversely affected by lower sales volume of installed products, cabinets, paints and stains, builders’ hardware and
windows, which, in aggregate, reduced sales by approximately three percent compared to 2010. Net sales for 2011 were also adversely affected by the planned exit of certain cabinet product lines, which reduced sales by approximately two percent
compared to 2010. Such declines were partially offset by selling price increases, primarily related to plumbing products and paints and stains, which increased sales by approximately three percent. A weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by one percent
compared to 2010.

Our gross profit margins were 25.2 percent, 23.9 percent and 24.5 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
2012 gross profit margin reflects a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs as well as increased sales volume. The decrease in the 2011 gross profit margin reflects lower sales volume and a less favorable relationship
between selling prices and commodity costs. Both 2012 and 2011 reflect the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 20.2 percent in 2012 compared with 21.2 percent in 2011 and 21.3 percent in 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
sales in 2012 reflect increased sales volume and lower business rationalization costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2011 reflect increased expenses related to growth initiatives, offset by lower business
rationalization expenses. Both 2012 and 2011 reflect the benefits associated with our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating profit (loss) in 2012, 2011 and 2010 includes $78 million, $121 million and $208 million, respectively, of costs and charges related to business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.
Operating profit (loss) in 2012, 2011 and 2010 includes $42 million, $494 million and $698 million, respectively, of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets. Operating profit (loss) in 2012 and 2011 includes $77 million and $9
million, respectively, of net charges for litigation settlements. Operating profit (loss) in 2012 includes $8 million of net gains related to fixed asset sales. Operating profit (loss) margins, as reported, were 3.5 percent, (4.0) percent
and (6.2) percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Operating profit margins, excluding the items above, were 6.1 percent, 4.4 percent and 5.9 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Operating margins in 2012 were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, increased sales
volume and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating margins in 2011 were
negatively affected by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, a less favorable product mix and increased expenses related to growth initiatives. Such decreases more than offset lower business rationalization costs
and the benefits associated with such expenses.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other, net, for 2012 included gains of $24 million from financial investments, net. During 2012, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
aggregating $2 million for an investment in a private equity fund. Other, net, for 2012 also included realized foreign currency losses of $2 million and other miscellaneous items.



During 2011, we recognized gains of $41 million related to the sale of TriMas common stock. We also
recognized gains of $32 million related to distributions from private equity funds.

Other, net, for 2011 also included realized foreign
currency losses of $5 million and other miscellaneous items.

During 2010, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges aggregating
$34 million related to financial investments ($28 million related to Asahi Tec preferred stock and $6 million related to private equity funds and other private investments).

Other, net, for 2010 included $9 million of income from financial investments, net. Other, net, for 2010 also included realized foreign currency losses of $2 million and other miscellaneous items.

Interest expense was $254 million, $254 million and $251 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(Loss) Income and (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations (Attributable to Masco Corporation)

(Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing operations for 2012 were $(76) million and $(.22) per common share,
respectively. (Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing operations for 2011 were $(465) million and $(1.34) per common share, respectively. (Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing operations for 2010 were $(1,022)
million and $(2.94) per common share, respectively. (Loss) from continuing operations for 2012 included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other intangible assets of $42 million ($27 million or $.08 per common share, after tax). (Loss) from
continuing operations for 2011 included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of $494 million ($335 million or $.96 per common share, after tax). (Loss) from continuing operations for 2010 included non-cash,
pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of $698 million ($586 million or $1.68 per common share, after tax).

Our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations was a 198 percent tax expense, a 10 percent tax benefit, and a 32 percent tax expense
in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Compared to our normalized effective tax rate of 36 percent, the variance in the effective tax rate in 2012, 2011 and 2010 is due primarily to changes in the U.S. Federal valuation allowance, reversal of an
accrual for uncertain tax positions and intangible asset impairment charges providing no tax benefit.

Outlook for the Company

We continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives, which include expanding our product leadership positions, reducing our
costs, improving our Installation and Cabinet segments and strengthening our balance sheet. We believe these initiatives, coupled with the actions we have taken over the past several years, should position us for improved results in 2013, and
continue to believe that we will outperform as new home construction and repair and remodel recover.

We believe and are confident that
the long-term fundamentals for new home construction and home improvement activity continue to be positive. We believe that our strong financial position, together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands, including KRAFTMAID and
MERILLAT cabinets, DELTA and HANSGROHE faucets, BEHR paint and MILGARD windows, our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles, will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.

Business Segment Results Discussion

Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general corporate expense, net,
charge for litigation settlements, net, gain from sales of fixed assets, net, and impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Business Rationalizations and Other Initiatives

Over the past several years, we have
been focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses, including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system implementations and other cost savings initiatives. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and
2010, we incurred net pre-tax costs and charges related to these initiatives of $78 million, $121 million and $208 million, respectively.

During 2012, our North American cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of $33 million related to the closure of its countertop
manufacturing facility (as a result of our strategic change to a sourcing model for countertops), the closure of a cabinet components facility and additional headcount reductions. Our Plumbing Products segment incurred costs of $25 million related
to a plant closure and severance in our bathing systems business in North America and a plant closure and severance in Spain. We also incurred $14 million in costs related to severance actions at our corporate office. Finally, we incurred $6 million
of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives.

During 2011, our North American cabinet
business continued to incur costs and charges of $24 million related to the exit of its ready-to-assemble product line and $6 million related to the integration of its facilities. Our European manufacturer of ready to assemble cabinetry also
incurred costs and charges of $9 million related to the closure of one manufacturing facility and the severance related to further headcount reductions. Our Installation and Other Services segment incurred costs and charges of $4 million related to
the closure of several locations and further headcount reductions. Our builders’ hardware business in the Decorative Architectural Products segment incurred costs and charges of $9 million related to the exit of a product line. Our North
American window manufacturer incurred costs and charges of $30 million related to the closure of several manufacturing facilities.

In
2010, we took several actions within the Cabinets and Related Products segment to rationalize our North American manufacturers, including closing plants, exiting product lines and integrating our Builder and Retail Cabinet Groups. We incurred costs
and charges of $171 million in 2010 related to these actions.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we decided to dispose of several non-core
businesses in the Installation and Other Services segment. These businesses were related to commercial drywall installation, millwork and framing, and were classified as discontinued operations for all periods. During 2012, we sold all of these
businesses, for net proceeds of $7 million.

Based on current plans, we anticipate costs and charges related to our business
rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate $40 million in 2013. We continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges.

In early February 2013, we determined that our Danish ready-to-assemble cabinet business was no longer core to our long-term growth
strategy and, accordingly we embarked on a plan for disposition. This business unit had 2012 sales of approximately $250 million and an operating loss of approximately $30 million. The disposition is expected to be completed within the next 12
months.



Cabinets and Related Products

Sales

Net sales of
Cabinets and Related Products decreased primarily due to lower sales volume of international operations, which decreased sales by three percent from 2011. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales volume of North American operations and
by increased selling prices, which increased sales by one percent compared to 2011. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales in this segment by two percent in 2012 compared to 2011.

Net sales in this segment decreased in 2011 primarily due to lower sales volumes of North American cabinets, which reduced sales by approximately
four percent compared to 2010. Sales in this segment in 2011 were also negatively affected by the planned exit of North American ready-to-assemble and other non-core in-stock assembled cabinet product lines, particle board and door product lines,
which reduced sales by approximately 11 percent compared to 2010. Sales were also negatively affected by lower sales volume of international cabinets, which reduced sales in this segment by approximately two percent compared to 2010. A weaker U.S.
dollar increased sales by one percent in 2011 compared to 2010.

Net sales in this segment in 2010 were negatively affected by lower
sales volumes of North American and international cabinets and the planned exit of ready-to-assemble and other non-core in-stock assembled cabinet product lines, particle board and door product lines.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Cabinets and Related Products segment in 2012 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the
benefits associated with such expenses incurred in prior years; such benefits were partially offset by lower operating results of international operations.

Operating margins in this segment in 2011 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with such expenses, including benefits related to the integration of the
North American cabinet businesses. Such increases were partially offset by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, aggressive promotional activity and lower sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed
costs.

Operating margins in this segment in 2010 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related under-absorption of
fixed costs, which reduced operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2010 were also negatively affected by increased business rationalization expenses and a less favorable
relationship between selling prices and commodity costs; such decreases more than offset the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Plumbing Products

Sales

Net sales of Plumbing Products increased in 2012 primarily due to increased sales
volume of North American operations and increased selling prices, which, in aggregate, increased sales by approximately five percent compared to 2011. Lower sales volume of international operations decreased sales in this segment by one percent from
2011. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by three percent in 2012 compared to 2011.

Net sales in this segment increased in 2011
primarily due to increased selling prices, which increased sales by approximately three percent compared to 2010. Sales were also positively affected by increased sales volume in North America and International, which, in aggregate, increased sales
by



approximately three percent compared to 2010. A weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by two percent in 2011 compared to 2010.

Net sales in this segment in 2010 were positively affected by a more favorable product mix to North American retailers and wholesalers, increased
selling prices, and sales of International operations. Such increases were partially offset by lower sales volume to North American retailers and wholesalers.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Plumbing Products segment in 2012 were
negatively affected by lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix principally related to international operations. Such declines more than offset increased North American sales volume and a more favorable relationship between selling prices
and commodity costs.

Operating margins in this segment in 2011 were negatively affected by a less favorable relationship between selling
prices and commodity costs, a less favorable product mix and increased expenses related to growth initiatives which offset the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating margins in this segment in 2010 were positively affected by a more favorable product mix and the positive relationship between selling
prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Installation and Other Services

Sales

Net sales in the Installation and Other Services segment increased in 2012
primarily due to increased sales volume related to a higher level of activity in the new home construction market and increased commercial sales.

Net sales in this segment increased in 2011 primarily due to increased distribution sales, increased selling prices and increased retrofit and commercial sales. Such increases were partially offset by lower sales
volume of installed products related to a continued decline in the new home construction market, the downward trend in the size and content of new houses in early 2011 and the increased multi-family construction; we gained share in single-family
construction.

Net sales in this segment decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower sales volume related to reduced share in the new home
construction market. Sales in this segment were also negatively affected by a downward trend in the size and content of new houses being constructed by our builder customers.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Installation and Other Services segment in
2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed costs, as well as the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating margins in the Installation and Other Services segment in 2011 were positively affected by increased sales volume, the benefits associated
with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs.

Operating margins in this segment in 2010 were negatively affected by lower sales volume in the new home construction market and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, as well as a less



favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. Such declines were partially offset by the benefits associated with business rationalization and other cost savings initiatives
and lower system implementation costs in 2010.

Decorative Architectural Products

Sales

Net sales of
Decorative Architectural Products increased in 2012, primarily due to increased selling prices of paints and stains, as well as increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders’ hardware.

Net sales in this segment decreased in 2011, primarily due to lower sales volume of paints and stains and builders’ hardware. Such declines in
2011 were partially offset by increased selling prices of paints and stains.

Net sales in this segment in 2010 were negatively affected
by lower sales volume of builders’ hardware and lower selling prices of paints and stains, partially offset by a more favorable product mix of paints and stains, related to new product introductions.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Decorative Architectural Products segment in 2012 reflect a more favorable product mix, a more favorable relationship
between selling prices and commodity costs related to paints and stains and lower program costs related to builders’ hardware.

Operating margins in this segment in 2011 were negatively affected by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs
related to paints and stains and increased expenses related to growth initiatives. This segment was also negatively affected by increased business rationalization expenses related to the exit of a builders’ hardware product line.

Operating margins in this segment in 2010 were negatively affected by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs
related to paints and stains, as well as lower sales volume of builders’ hardware. Such declines more than offset the benefit of a more favorable product mix of paints and stains, related to new product introductions.

Other Specialty Products

Sales

Net sales of Other Specialty Products were flat in 2012 primarily due to
increased sales volume of windows in Western markets in the U.S., a more favorable product mix and increased selling prices which were offset by lower sales volume of North American windows resulting from the exit of certain markets.

Net sales in this segment decreased in 2011 primarily due to lower sales volume of windows in North America (due to the expiration of the energy tax
credit in 2010) and the U.K., partially offset by increased selling prices and increased sales related to new product introductions and geographic expansion. A weaker U.S. dollar increased sales in this segment by one percent compared to 2010.

Net sales in this segment increased in 2010 primarily due to increased sales volume of windows in North America, principally related to
the energy-savings tax credit which expired at the end of 2010, and increased sales volume of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.

Operating Results

Operating results in the Other Specialty Products segment in 2012
were positively affected by the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives, lower business



rationalization costs and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. These items more than offset the increased warranty expense of $12 million.

Operating margins in this segment in 2011 were negatively affected by increased business rationalization expenses, lower sales volume and increased
product launch and geographic expansion costs. Such decreases offset a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating margins in this segment in 2010 reflect the negative effect of a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs
and a less favorable windows product mix. Such declines offset the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Geographic Area Results Discussion

North America

Sales

North American
net sales in 2012 were positively impacted by increased sales volume of installation and other services, plumbing products, paints and stains, builders’ hardware and windows, which, in the aggregate, increased sales by approximately four
percent compared to 2011. Net sales were also positively affected by increased selling prices of plumbing products and paints and stains, which increased sales by approximately three percent compared to 2011.

North American net sales in 2011 were negatively impacted by lower sales volume of cabinets, including the planned exit of certain product lines,
paints and stains, builders’ hardware and windows, which, in the aggregate, decreased sales by approximately six percent compared to 2010. Such declines were partially offset by increased selling prices of plumbing products and paints and
stains, which increased sales by approximately three percent compared to 2010.

North American net sales in 2010 were negatively impacted
by lower sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets, plumbing products, and builders’ hardware, partially offset by a more favorable product mix of plumbing products and paints and stains, which increased sales by approximately
one percent compared to 2009.

Operating Results

Operating margins from North American operations in 2012 were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, lower business rationalization expenses and the
benefits associated with business rationalization and other cost savings initiatives which, in aggregate, increased operating margins by three percentage points.

Operating margins from North American operations in 2011 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with business rationalization and other cost savings
initiatives, which increased operating margins by two percentage points. Such increases offset the negative impact of lower sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed costs and a less favorable relationship between selling prices and
commodity costs which, in the aggregate, decreased operating profit margins by one percentage point in 2011 compared to 2010.

Operating
margins from North American operations in 2010 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed costs and a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, which decreased operating
profit margins by two percentage points in 2010 compared to 2009. Operating margins were also negatively affected by increased business rationalization costs and charges in 2010 compared to 2009.



International, Principally Europe

Sales

Net sales from
international operations in 2012 were flat in local currencies compared to 2011, primarily due to lower sales volume of international plumbing products, cabinets and windows, offset by increased selling prices. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased
International net sales by six percent in 2012 compared to 2011.

Net sales from international operations increased in local currencies
in 2011 by approximately three percent compared to 2010, primarily due to increased sales volume and increased selling prices of International plumbing products, offset by lower sales volume of International cabinets. A weaker U.S. dollar increased
International net sales by five percent in 2011 compared to 2010.

Net sales from international operations increased in local currencies
in 2010, primarily due to increased sales volume and increased selling prices of International plumbing products and windows, offset by lower sales volume of International cabinets.

Operating Results

Operating profit margins from international operations in 2012 were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix, partially offset by a more
favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, primarily related to international plumbing products, the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating profit margins from international operations in 2011 were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix and a less favorable
relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, partially offset by the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating profit margins from international operations in 2010 were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost
savings initiatives.

Other Matters

Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

Information regarding our legal proceedings is set forth in Note T to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Other Commitments

With respect to our investments in private equity funds, we had, at December 31, 2012, commitments to contribute up to $19 million of additional capital to such funds, representing our aggregate capital
commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. We are contractually obligated to make additional capital contributions to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. We have no control
over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our investment in the private equity fund when paid.

We enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which we operate. Such
indemnifications include claims made against



builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, we occasionally provide reasonable and customary
indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; and provisions for sales returns. We have never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications, and we evaluate
the probability that amounts may be incurred and we appropriately record an estimated liability when probable.

Contractual Obligations

The following table provides payment obligations related to current contracts at December 31, 2012, in millions:

(A)

We assumed that all debt would be held to maturity.

(B)

There is no schedule for the capital commitments to the private equity funds; such allocation was estimated.

(C)

Excludes contracts that do not require volume commitments and open or pending purchase orders.

(D)

Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate for the
period beyond the next year in which cash settlements may occur with applicable tax authorities.

Refer to Footnote M of
our financial statements for defined-benefit plan obligations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

On January 1,
2012, we adopted new accounting guidance requiring more prominent presentation of other comprehensive income items in our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or our
results of operations.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We have considered the provisions of accounting guidance regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, and disclosure of quantitative and
qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments.

We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity costs in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to our financial investments.
We have involvement with derivative financial instruments and use such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and commodity fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information regarding our derivative instruments.

At December 31, 2012, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the
potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates, a 10 percent decline in the market value of our long-term investments, a 10 percent change
in commodity costs, or a 10 percent change in interest rates. Based upon the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management
of Masco Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Masco Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The management of Masco Corporation assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework.” Based on this assessment, management has determined that
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, performed an audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of Masco Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
Their report expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Masco Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 and expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s 2012 consolidated
financial statements. This report appears under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Masco Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Masco Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Masco
Corporation and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations of variable interest entities, for which the Company is the
primary beneficiary.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of Financial Statements.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred
to customers or when services are rendered, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. The Company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon material and labor incurred in the Installation and Other Services
segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables. Amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in net sales, while costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales.

Customer Promotion Costs.

The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive
offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. In-store displays that are owned by the Company and used to market the Company’s products are included in other assets
in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of three to five years; related amortization expense is classified as a selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Currency.

The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using
the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. The
resulting cumulative translation adjustments have been recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity. Realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements
of operations in other income (expense), net.

Cash and Cash Investments.

The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash investments.

Receivables.

The Company does significant business with a number of customers, including certain home centers and
homebuilders. The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses on its customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of its customers on an on-going basis and records related allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are estimated
based upon specific customer balances, where a risk of default has been identified, and also include a provision for non-customer specific defaults based upon historical collection, return and write-off activity. During downturns in the
Company’s markets, declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impacts the credit risk of the receivables involved and the Company has incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults. A separate
allowance is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally based upon sales activity. Receivables are presented net of certain allowances (including allowances for doubtful accounts) of $74 million and $61 million at December 31,



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

2012 and 2011, respectively. Receivables include unbilled revenue related to the Installation and Other Services segment of $18 million and $17 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment, including significant betterments to
existing facilities, are recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations. Maintenance and repair costs
are charged against earnings as incurred.

The Company reviews its property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, then the Company would recognize an
impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value. Further, the Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances
warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense is computed
principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Annual depreciation rates are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10 percent, and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation
expense was $202 million, $246 million and $261 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Such depreciation expense included accelerated depreciation of $28 million (primarily in the Cabinets and Related Products and Plumbing Products segments),
$59 million (primarily in the Cabinets and Related Products and Other Specialty Products segments) and $43 million (primarily in the Cabinets and Related Products segment) in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth
quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has defined its reporting units and completed the impairment testing of
goodwill at the operating segment level. The Company’s operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities, for which discrete financial information, including five-year forecasts, are available. The Company compares the
fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow method, which includes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).

Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions,
including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Company’s judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other
information. In estimating future cash flows, the Company relies on internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term assumed annual growth rate
of cash flows for periods after the five-year forecast. The Company utilizes its weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9.5 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. In 2012, due to
market conditions, the Company increased the discount rate to a range of 11 percent to 13 percent for most of its reporting units. The Company records an impairment to goodwill (adjusting the value to the estimated fair value) if the book value
exceeds the estimated fair value.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth
quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

be impaired without regard to the reporting unit. The Company considers the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g.,
product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near–and long-term.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at each
reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. See Note H for additional information regarding Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Fair Value Accounting.

The Company follows accounting guidance for its financial investments and liabilities which
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company also follows this guidance for its non-financial investments and liabilities.

The fair value of financial investments and liabilities is determined at each balance sheet date and future declines in market conditions, the
future performance of the underlying investments or new information could affect the recorded values of the Company’s investments in marketable securities, private equity funds and other private investments.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows resulting from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, commodity costs and interest rate exposures. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. For each derivative financial
instrument that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in determining current
earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in determining current earnings during the period of the change in fair value.

Warranty.

At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products,
parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the
warranty coverage, the warranty period, historical experience specific to the nature, frequency and average cost to service the claim, along with product manufacturing metrics and industry and demographic trends.

Certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the
aforementioned factors. The Company believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals.

A majority of the Company’s business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product
to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the Company. The Company’s revenue recognition policy takes
into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale.

Product
Liability.

The Company provides for expenses associated with product liability obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or
circumstances change that would affect the estimated liability.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Concluded)

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company measures compensation expense
for stock awards at the market price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date. Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 5 to
10 years (except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at age 65. For stock awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, such expense
is being recognized over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will become, retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the expense is being recognized over five years or immediately
upon a grantee’s retirement.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model. Such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at age 65. The Company utilizes the shortcut
method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock options.

Noncontrolling Interest.

The
Company owns 68 percent of Hansgrohe AG at both December 31, 2012 and 2011. The aggregate noncontrolling interest, net of dividends, at December 31, 2012 and 2011 has been recorded as a component of equity on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets.

Interest and Penalties on Uncertain Tax Positions.

The Company records
interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Reclassifications.

Certain
prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation in the consolidated financial statements. In the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately
classified.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted new
accounting guidance requiring more prominent presentation of other comprehensive income items in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s financial position
or its results of operations.

B.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The presentation of discontinued operations includes components of the Company that the Company intends to sell, which comprises
operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Company. The Company has accounted for the business units identified in 2011 as discontinued operations.

During 2011, the Company determined that several businesses in the Installation and Other Services segment were not core to the Company’s
long-term growth strategy. These businesses provide commercial drywall installation, millwork and framing services. During 2012, the Company disposed all of these businesses for net proceeds of $7 million.

Losses from these 2011 discontinued operations were included in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the consolidated statements of
operations.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

B.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (Concluded)

Selected financial information for the discontinued operations during the period owned by the
Company, were as follows, in millions:

Included in the impairment of assets held for sale, net in 2011 is the impairment of indefinite and definite-lived
intangible assets of $56 million, the impairment of goodwill of $13 million and the impairment of fixed and other assets of $17 million. Included in the loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net in 2011 is $3 million expense reflecting the
adjustment of certain assets related to businesses disposed in prior years.

The unusual relationship between income tax expense and loss
before income tax in 2012 results primarily from the increase in the deferred tax liability associated with the abandonment of tax basis in indefinite-lived intangibles due to the disposition of certain discontinued operations.

The unusual relationship between income taxes and loss before income taxes in 2011 resulted primarily from certain losses providing no current tax
benefit.

The income tax benefit recorded in 2010 relates primarily to the allocation of an income tax benefit to impairment charges on
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain discontinued operations.

Also during 2011, the Company decided to exit
a product line in builders’ hardware in the Decorative Architectural Products segment with net sales of $1 million and an operating loss of $15 million in 2011 (including $8 million to write-down inventory related to satisfaction of
contractual obligations). In the first quarter of 2012, the Company disposed of this product line. This business was included in continuing operations through the date of disposal.

C.  ACQUISITIONS

In late 2011, the Company acquired a small manufacturer of hot tubs in the Plumbing Products segment; this business allows the
Company to expand its spa offering into additional price point categories. The total net cash purchase price was $10 million in 2011. The results of this acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Certain purchase agreements provided for the payment of additional consideration in cash, contingent upon whether certain conditions are
met, including the operating performance of the acquired business. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there was no outstanding contingent consideration.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

D.  INVENTORIES

Inventories, which include purchased parts, materials, direct labor and applied manufacturing overhead, are stated
at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined by use of the first-in, first-out method.

E.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES

Accounting Policy.

The Company follows accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures about fair value measurements for its financial investments and liabilities. The guidance defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” Further, it defines a fair value hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2
inputs as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data; and Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

Financial investments that are available to be traded on readily accessible stock exchanges (domestic or foreign) are considered to have active
markets and have been valued using Level 1 inputs. Financial investments that are not available to be traded on a public market or have limited secondary markets, or contain provisions that limit the ability to sell the investment are considered to
have inactive markets and have been valued using Level 2 or 3 inputs. The Company incorporated credit risk into the valuations of financial investments by estimating the likelihood of non-performance by the counterparty to the applicable
transactions. The estimate included the length of time relative to the contract, financial condition of the counterparty and current market conditions. The criteria for determining if a market was active or inactive were based on the individual
facts and circumstances.

Financial Investments.

The Company has maintained investments in
available-for-sale securities and a number of private equity funds and other private investments, principally as part of its tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future tax capital losses.

The Company’s investments in available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows,
in millions:

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost. At
December 31, 2012, the Company has investments in 15 venture capital funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $16 million. The venture capital funds invest in start-up or smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the
information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors. At December 31, 2012, the Company also has investments in 21 buyout funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $53 million. The buyout funds invest in later-stage, established
businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector.

Recurring Fair Value
Measurements.

For financial investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period, the unrealized gains or losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect, through
shareholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and charges for other-than-temporary impairments are included in determining net income, with related purchase costs based upon specific
identification.

For marketable securities, the Company reviews, on a recurring basis, industry analyst reports, key ratios and
statistics, market analyses and other factors for each investment to determine if an unrealized loss is other-than-temporary.

In the
past, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or 35 days. The fair values of the auction rate securities held by the Company
have been estimated, on a recurring basis, using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). The significant inputs in the discounted cash flow model used to value the auction rate securities include: expected maturity of auction rate securities,
discount rate used to determine the present value of expected cash flows and assumptions for credit defaults, since the auction rate securities are backed by credit default swap agreements.

During 2011, the Company sold 1,974,000 shares of its investment in TriMas common stock for cash of $43 million; at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
the Company did not own any shares of TriMas common stock.

The following table summarizes the changes in Level 3 financial investments measured at fair value on a recurring

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

It is not practicable for the Company to
estimate a fair value for private equity funds and other private investments because there are no quoted market prices, and sufficient information is not readily available for the Company to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for
each fund. These investments are evaluated, on a non-recurring basis, for potential other-than-temporary impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a significant adverse
effect on the fair value of the investment.

Impairment indicators the Company considers include the following: whether there has been a
significant deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment; a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic
area in which the investment operates; industry and sector performance; current equity and credit market conditions; and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. The Company also considers specific adverse
conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund, including industry and sector performance. The significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential

E.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES (Continued)

other-than-temporary impairment include current economic conditions, market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in the residential and commercial construction, bio-technology,
health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds’ investments operate. Since there is no active trading market for these investments, they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also
have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity
fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3 input.

Financial investments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during 2012 and the amounts for each level within the fair value hierarchy
were as follows, in millions:

During 2011, there were no financial investments measured on a non-recurring basis. None of the Company’s
investments in private equity funds, for which fair value was determined, had unrealized losses in 2012 or 2011.

The remaining private
equity investments in 2012 with an aggregate carrying value of $67 million, were not reviewed for impairment, as there were no indicators of impairment or identified events or changes in circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on
the fair value of the investment.

The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets in 2012 or 2011.

Realized Gains (Losses) and Impairment Charges.

During July 2012, based on information from a fund manager, the Company determined that the decline in estimated value of one private
equity fund (with an aggregate carrying value of $4 million prior to impairment) was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $2 million. During 2010, based on information from the fund managers, the
Company determined that the decline in the estimated value of three private equity funds (with an aggregate carrying value of $6 million prior to impairment) was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
of $4 million. During 2010, the Company also determined that the decline in the estimated value of one private investment was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $2 million.

Income from financial investments, net, included in other, net, within other income (expense),
net, and impairment charges for financial investments were as follows, in millions:

During 2010, the Company and Asahi Tec agreed to amend the preferred stock to include a more favorable conversion
feature into common stock and to include a mandatory conversion date of February 28, 2011. As a result of the amendment, the Company recognized a $28 million impairment loss based on the current fair value of the preferred stock on an
if-converted basis in 2010. During the last six months of 2010, the Company converted all its holdings of Asahi Tec preferred stock into common stock which was sold, in its entirety, in open market transactions. The Company realized cash proceeds of
$11 million and realized losses aggregating $8 million in 2010. As a result of the disposition of the Asahi Tec common stock, the Company received a tax refund of $16 million in 2011 relating to the utilization of a loss carryback to offset taxes
paid on prior capital gains.

The impairment charges related to the Company’s financial investments recognized during 2012 and 2010
were based upon then-current estimates for the fair value of certain financial investments; such estimates could change in the near-term based upon future events and circumstances.

The fair value of the Company’s short-term and long-term fixed-rate debt instruments is based principally upon modeled market prices for the
same or similar issues or the current rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. The aggregate estimated market value of short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2012 was approximately $4.0
billion, compared with the aggregate carrying value of $3.6 billion. The aggregate estimated market value of short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2011 was approximately $4.0 billion, compared with the aggregate carrying value of $4.0
billion.

F.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company is exposed to global market risk as part of its normal daily business activities. To manage these risks, the Company
enters into various derivative contracts. These contracts include interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency exchange contracts and contracts intended to hedge the Company’s exposure to copper and zinc. The Company reviews its hedging
program, derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis.

Interest Rate Swap
Agreements.

In March 2012, in connection with the issuance of $400 million of debt, the Company terminated the interest rate swap hedge relationships that it had entered into in August 2011. These interest rate swaps were
designated as cash flow hedges and effectively

F.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued)

fixed interest rates on the forecasted debt issuance to variable rates based on 3-month LIBOR. Upon termination, the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges of approximately $2 million loss
was recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations in other, net. The remaining loss of approximately $23 million from the termination of these swaps is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the remaining
term of the debt, through March 2022. At December 31, 2012, the balance remaining was $21 million. At December 31, 2011, the interest rate swaps were considered 100 percent effective; therefore, the market valuation of $23 million was
recorded in other comprehensive income in the Company’s statement of shareholders’ equity with a corresponding increase to accrued other in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011.

In 2012, the Company recognized a decrease in interest expense of $6 million, offset by interest expense of $2 million related to the cash flow
hedge terminated in March 2012. In 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized a decrease in interest expense of $10 million and $12 million, respectively, related to the amortization of gains resulting from the terminations (in 2008 and 2004) of two fair
value interest rate swap agreements.

Foreign Currency Contracts.

The Company’s net cash inflows and
outflows exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arise from the sale of products in countries other than the manufacturing source, foreign currency denominated supplier payments, debt and other payables, and investments in
subsidiaries. To mitigate this risk during 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company, including certain European operations, entered into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts.

Gains (losses) related to foreign currency forward and exchange contracts are recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations
in other income (expense), net. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts, the Company’s exposure is limited to the aggregate foreign currency rate differential with such institutions.

Metals Contracts.

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company entered into several contracts to manage its
exposure to increases in the price of copper and zinc. Gains (losses) related to these contracts are recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in cost of sales.

The pre-tax (losses) gains included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations are as follows, in millions:

G.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

G.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT (Concluded)

The Company leases certain equipment and plant facilities under noncancellable operating leases.
Rental expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations totaled approximately $96 million, $103 million and $111 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future minimum lease payments at December 31, 2012 were
approximately as follows: 2013 – $91 million; 2014 – $43 million; 2015 – $30 million; 2016 – $20 million; 2017 – $14 million; and 2018 and beyond – $62 million.

The Company leases operating facilities from certain related parties, primarily former owners (and in certain cases, current management personnel)
of companies acquired. The Company recorded rental expense to such related parties of approximately $5 million, $5 million and $6 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

As a result of its business rationalization activities over the last several years, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company was holding several facilities for sale, within the Cabinets and Related Products
segment and the Other Specialty Products segment. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the net book value of those facilities was approximately $14 million and $49 million, respectively, and approximates fair value. Fair value was estimated
using a market approach, considering the estimated fair values for the other comparable buildings in the areas where the facilities are located, Level 3 inputs.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company determined that the estimated fair value calculated for one business unit in the Cabinets and Related Products segment and one business unit in the Plumbing Products
segment was lower than the net book value of each of those business units. The Company assessed the long-lived assets associated with these business units and determined that no impairment was necessary at December 31, 2012.

H.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for 2012 and 2011, by segment, were as follows, in millions:



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

H.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Continued)

(A)

Additions include acquisitions.

(B)

During 2011, the Company reclassified the goodwill related to the business units held for sale. Subsequent to the reclassification, the Company recognized a charge for
those business units expected to be divested at a loss; the charge included a write-down of goodwill of $13 million.

(C)

Other principally includes the effect of foreign currency translation and purchase price adjustments related to prior-year acquisitions.

In the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, the Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets. The impairment test in 2012 indicated there was no impairment of goodwill for any of the Company’s reporting units.

The
impairment test in 2011 indicated that goodwill recorded for certain of the Company’s reporting units was impaired. The Company recognized the non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges, in continuing operations, for goodwill of $486 million ($330
million, after tax) for 2011. In 2011, the pre-tax impairment charge in the Cabinets and Related Products segment relates to the European ready-to-assemble cabinet manufacturer and reflects the declining demand for certain products, as well as
decreased operating margins. The pre-tax impairment charge in the Decorative Architectural Products segment relates to the builders’ hardware business and reflects increasing competitive conditions for that business. The pre-tax impairment
charge in the Other Specialty Products segment relates to the North American window and door business and reflects the continuing weak level of new home construction activity in the western U.S., the reduced levels of repair and remodel activity and
the expectation that recovery in these segments will be modestly slower than anticipated. The Company then assessed the long-lived assets associated with these business units and determined no impairment was necessary at December 31, 2011.

Other indefinite-lived intangible assets were $132 million and $174 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and
principally included registered trademarks. In 2012 and 2011, the impairment test indicated that the registered trademark for a North American business unit in the Other Specialty Products segment and the registered trademark for a North American
business unit in the Plumbing Products segment (2011 only) were impaired due to changes in the long-term outlook for the business units. The Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $42
million ($27 million, after tax) and $8 million ($5 million, after tax) in 2012 and 2011, respectively. In 2010, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $10 million ($6 million
after tax) related to the Installation and Other Services segment ($9 million pre-tax) and the Plumbing Products segment ($1 million pre-tax).

H.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Concluded)

The carrying value of the Company’s definite-lived intangible assets was $19 million at
December 31, 2012 (net of accumulated amortization of $57 million) and $22 million at December 31, 2011 (net of accumulated amortization of $54 million) and principally included customer relationships and non-compete agreements, with a
weighted average amortization period of 6 years in both 2012 and 2011. Amortization expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets of continuing operations was $6 million in each of 2012, 2011 and 2010.

At December 31, 2012, amortization expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets during each of the next five years was as follows:
2013 – $5 million; 2014 – $4 million; 2015 – $4 million; 2016 – $2 million; and 2017 – $1 million.

I.  OTHER ASSETS

In-store displays are amortized using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of three to five years;
the Company recognized amortization expense related to in-store displays of $21 million, $24 million and $33 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash spent for displays was $23 million, $17 million and $32 million in 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively.

K.  DEBT

All of the notes and debentures above are senior indebtedness and, other than the 6.625% notes due 2018 and the
7.75% notes due 2029, are redeemable at the Company’s option.

On March 5, 2012, the Company issued $400 million of 5.95% Notes
(“the Notes”) due March 15, 2022. Including the interest rate swap amortization, the effective interest rate for the Notes is approximately 6.5%, see Note F. The Notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at the Company’s
option.

In January 2012, the Company repurchased $46 million of 5.875% Notes due July 15, 2012 in open-market transactions; the
Company paid a premium of $1 million for the repurchase. In July 2012, the Company retired all of its $745 million of 5.875% Notes on the scheduled retirement date.

On June 21, 2010, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of January 10, 2014.
On February 11, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment (deemed to be effective and applicable as of December 31, 2010) of the Credit Agreement with its bank group (the “Amendment”).

On February 13, 2012, the Company entered into another amendment (deemed to be effective and applicable as of December 31, 2011) of the
Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”). The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a maximum debt to total adjusted capitalization ratio of 65 percent. The Second Amendment provides for the
add-back to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s debt to capitalization covenant of (i) certain non-cash charges (including impairment charges for financial investments and goodwill and other intangible assets) and (ii) changes
to the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets included in income tax expense. The Second Amendment also permits the Company to add back, if incurred, up to $250 million in the aggregate of future non-cash charges
subsequent to December 31, 2011. The Second Amendment revised the permitted ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to 2.25 to 1.00 through December 31, 2012, increasing to 2.50 to 1.00 with respect to each quarter
thereafter.

K.  DEBT (Concluded)

The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to the Company
and one of its foreign subsidiaries, in U.S. dollars, European euros and certain other currencies. Borrowings under the revolver denominated in euros are limited to $500 million, equivalent. The Company can also borrow swingline loans up to $150
million and obtain Letters of Credit of up to $250 million. Any outstanding Letters of Credit reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $78 million of outstanding and unused Letters of Credit,
reducing the Company’s borrowing capacity by such amount.

Revolving credit loans bear interest under the Credit Agreement, at the
Company’s option: at (A) a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.0% (the “Alternative Base Rate”); plus an applicable margin
based upon the then-applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company; or (B) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the then-applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company. The foreign currency revolving credit loans bear interest at
a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the then-applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company.

Based on the
limitations of the debt to total capitalization covenant, at December 31, 2012 the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $873 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2012, the Company could absorb a
reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately $470 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant.

In order to borrow under the Credit Agreement, there must not be any default in the Company’s covenants in the Credit Agreement (i.e., in addition to the two financial covenants, principally limitations on
subsidiary debt, negative pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and maintenance of properties and insurance) and the Company’s representations and warranties in the Credit Agreement must be true in all material respects on the date
of borrowing (i.e., principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change, since December 31, 2009, in each case, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance and no material tax deficiency).

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

At December 31, 2012, the debt maturities during each of the next five years were as follows: 2013 – $206 million;
2014 – $1 million; 2015 – $501 million; 2016 – $1,001 million; and 2017 – $301 million.

Interest paid was $269 million, $254 million and $241 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

L.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) provides for the issuance of stock-based
incentives in various forms to employees and non-employee Directors of the Company. At December 31, 2012, outstanding stock-based incentives were in the form of long-term stock awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation
rights.

L.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

Pre-tax compensation expense (income) and the income tax benefit related to these stock-based
incentives were as follows, in millions:

At December 31, 2012, a total of 10,718,100 shares of Company common stock were available under the 2005 Plan
for the granting of stock options and other long-term stock incentive awards.

Long-Term Stock
Awards.

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal
number of shares on the open market.

The Company’s long-term stock award activity was as follows, shares in millions:

At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, there was $72 million, $107 million and $127 million, respectively,
of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards; such awards had a weighted average remaining vesting period of four years for 2012, four years for 2011 and five years for 2010.

The total market value (at the vesting date) of stock award shares which vested during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $27 million, $28 million and $22
million, respectively.

Stock Options.

Stock options are granted to key employees of the Company. The
exercise price equals the market price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date. These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than
10 years after the grant date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options, except for restoration options resulting from options previously granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration stock options become exercisable six
months from the date of grant.

The Company granted 1,080,750 of stock option shares, including restoration stock option shares, during
2012 with a grant date exercise price of approximately $12 per share. During 2012, 5,894,710 stock option shares were forfeited (including options that expired unexercised).

December 31, 2012, shares in millions:

Phantom Stock Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”).

The Company
grants phantom stock awards and SARs to certain non-U.S. employees.

Phantom stock awards are linked to the value of the Company’s
common stock on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon vesting, typically over 5 to 10 years. The Company accounts for phantom stock awards as liability-based awards; the compensation expense is initially measured as the market price of the
Company’s common stock at the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period. The liability is remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the awards are fully-vested and paid to the employees. The Company recognized
expense of $7 million, $2 million and $2 million related to the valuation of phantom stock awards for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company granted 162,310 shares, 349,550 shares and 299,650 shares, respectively, of
phantom stock awards with an aggregate fair value of $2 million, $4 million and $4 million, respectively, and paid $3 million, $2 million and $1 million of cash in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to settle phantom stock awards.

SARs are linked to the value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon exercise. The Company accounts for
SARs using the fair value method, which requires outstanding SARs to be classified as liability-based awards and valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date; such fair value is recognized as compensation expense over the
vesting period, typically five years. The liability is remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the SARs are exercised and payment is made to the employees or the SARs expire. The Company recognized expense (income) of $4
million, $(1) million and $1 million related to the valuation of SARs for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2012 and 2011, the Company did not grant any SARs. During 2010, the Company granted SARs for 429,300 shares, with an aggregate fair
value of $2 million in 2010.

Information related to phantom stock awards and SARs was as follows, in millions:

M.  EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors qualified defined-benefit and defined-contribution retirement plans for most of its employees. In addition
to the Company’s qualified defined-benefit pension plans, the Company has unfunded non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans covering certain employees, which provide for benefits in addition to those provided by the qualified pension plans.
Substantially all salaried employees participate in non-contributory defined-contribution retirement plans, to which payments are determined annually by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Aggregate charges to
earnings under the Company’s defined-benefit and defined-contribution retirement plans were $36 million and $43 million in 2012, $34 million and $31 million in 2011 and $34 million and $47 million in 2010, respectively.

In addition, the Company participates in 20 regional multi-employer pension plans, principally related to building trades; none of the plans are
considered significant. The aggregate expense recognized through contributions by the Company to these plans was approximately $4 million, $3 million and $3 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In March 2009, based on management’s recommendation, the Board of Directors approved a plan to freeze all future benefit accruals under
substantially all of the Company’s domestic qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans. The freeze was effective January 1, 2010.

Changes in the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of the Company’s defined-benefit pension plans were as follows, in millions:

Plan Assets.

The Company’s qualified defined-benefit pension
plan weighted average asset allocation, which is based upon fair value, was as follows:

Plan assets included 600,000 and 1.2 million shares of Company common stock valued at $10 million and $12
million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The Company’s qualified defined-benefit pension plans have adopted
accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures about fair value measurements. Accounting guidance defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.”

Following is a
description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2012.

Common and Preferred Stocks and Short-Term and Other Investments:

Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, or based on the active market for
similar securities. For certain Short-Term and Other Investments, there is no active trading market and they are for the most part illiquid. Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements used to estimate fair value are
Level 3 inputs.

Private Equity Funds:

Valued based on an estimated fair value using either a market approach or an income
approach, each of which requires a significant degree of judgment. There is no active trading market for these investments and they are for the most part illiquid. Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements used to
estimate fair value are a Level 3 input.

Corporate Debt Securities:

Valued based on the active market for similar securities or
on estimated fair value based on a model for similar securities.

Government and Other Debt Securities:

Valued based on either the
closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, the market for similar securities or on estimated fair value.

Common Collective Trust Fund:

Valued based on a unit value basis, which approximates fair value as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Such basis is determined by reference to the respective
fund’s underlying assets, which are primarily marketable equity and fixed income securities. There are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with this fund.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair
values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could
result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the qualified defined-benefit
pension plan level 3 assets, in millions.

Assumptions.

Major assumptions used in accounting for the Company’s
defined-benefit pension plans were as follows:

The discount rate for obligations for 2012 and 2011 was based upon the expected duration of each defined-benefit
pension plan’s liabilities matched to the December 31, 2012 and 2011 Towers Watson Rate Link Curve. At December 31, 2012, such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension plans ranged from 1.75 percent to 4.50 percent, with
the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 3.40 percent or higher. At December 31, 2011, such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension plans ranged from 2.00 percent to 5.50 percent,
with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 4.20 percent or higher. The decline in the weighted average discount rate over the last several years is principally the result of lower long-term
interest rates in the bond markets. The weighted average discount rates were also affected by the freezing of all future benefit accruals for substantially all of the Company’s domestic qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit plans, which
shortened the period of future payments.

For 2012 and 2011, the Company determined the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
of 7.25 percent based upon an analysis of expected and historical rates of return of various asset classes utilizing the current and long-term target asset allocation of the plan assets. The projected asset return at both December 31, 2012 and
2011 also considered near term returns, including current market conditions and also that pension assets are long-term in nature. The actual annual rate of return on the Company’s pension plan assets was 6.9 percent and 3.2 percent for the
10-year periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Although these rates of return are less than the Company’s current expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company notes that the 10-year period ended
December 31, 2012 includes one significant decline in the equity markets. In 2012, actual annual rate of return on the Company’s pension plan assets was 17 percent. Accordingly, the Company believes a 7.25 percent expected long-term rate
of return is reasonable.

The investment objectives seek to minimize the volatility of the value of the Company’s plan assets
relative to pension liabilities and to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits. In



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

M.  EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)

2012 and 2011, the Company achieved its targeted asset allocation: 45 percent equities, 25 percent fixed-income, 15 percent global assets (combination of equity and fixed-income) and 15 percent
alternative investments (such as private equity, commodities and hedge funds). The asset allocation of the investment portfolio was developed with the objective of achieving the Company’s expected rate of return and reducing volatility of asset
returns, and considered the freezing of future benefits. The equity portfolios are invested in individual securities or funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. The fixed-income portfolio is invested in corporate
bonds, bond index funds or U.S. Treasury securities. The increased allocation to fixed-income securities partially matches the bond-like and long-term nature of the pension liabilities. It is expected that the alternative investments would have a
higher rate of return than the targeted overall long-term return of 7.25 percent. However, these investments are subject to greater volatility, due to their nature, than a portfolio of equities and fixed-income investments, and would be less liquid
than financial instruments that trade on public markets. This portfolio is expected to yield a long-term rate of return of 7.25 percent.

The fair value of the Company’s plan assets is subject to risk including significant concentrations of risk in the Company’s plan assets
related to equity, interest rate and operating risk. In order to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay benefits, a portion of plan assets is allocated to equity investments that are expected, over time, to earn higher returns with more volatility
than fixed-income investments which more closely match pension liabilities. Within equity, risk is mitigated by targeting a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and
process.

In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets are allocated to fixed-income
investments that are exposed to interest rate risk. Rate increases generally will result in a decline in fixed-income assets, while reducing the present value of the liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed income assets,
partially offsetting the related increase in the liabilities.

Potential events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on
estimated fair value include the risks of inadequate diversification and other operating risks. To mitigate these risks, investments are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives. Policies and practices to
address operating risks include ongoing manager oversight, plan and asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers, and periodic compliance and audit reviews to ensure adherence to these policies. In addition,
the Company periodically seeks the input of its independent advisor to ensure the investment policy is appropriate.

Other.

The Company sponsors certain post-retirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental and life insurance
coverage for eligible retirees and dependents in the United States based upon age and length of service. The aggregate present value of the unfunded accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was $12 million and $14 million at December 31,
2012 and 2011, respectively.

Cash Flows.

At December 31, 2012, the Company expected to contribute
approximately $36 million to its qualified defined-benefit pension plans to meet ERISA requirements in 2013. The Company also expected to pay benefits of $7 million and $12 million to participants of its foreign and non-qualified (domestic)
defined-benefit pension plans, respectively, in 2013.

N.  SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

In July 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase for retirement of up to 50 million shares of
the Company’s common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise. At December 31, 2012, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 24 million shares. During 2012, the Company repurchased and retired one million
shares of Company common stock, for cash aggregating $8 million to offset the dilutive impact of the 2012 grant of one million shares of long-term stock awards. The Company repurchased and retired two million common shares in 2011 and three million
common shares in 2010 for cash aggregating $30 million and $45 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

On the basis of amounts paid

R.  INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the net deferred tax liability consisted of net short-term deferred tax assets
included in prepaid expenses and other of $41 million and $11 million, respectively, and net long-term deferred tax liabilities included in deferred income taxes and other of $321 million and $250 million, respectively.

The current portion of the state and local income tax benefit includes a $14 million and $10 million tax benefit from the reversal of an accrual for
uncertain tax positions resulting primarily from the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and favorable settlements on state audits in 2012 and



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

R.  INCOME TAXES (Continued)

2011, respectively. The deferred portion of the state and local taxes includes a $26 million and $31 million non-cash charge to income tax expense resulting from a change in the valuation
allowance against state and local deferred tax assets in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The accounting guidance for income taxes requires
that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable
temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.

If, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent likely) such deferred tax assets
will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company’s three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in
considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the Company can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a $372 million valuation allowance against its U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash
charge to income tax expense. In reaching this conclusion, the Company considered the weaker retail sales of certain of its building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the U.S. housing market which led to U.S. operating losses and
significant U.S. goodwill impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing the Company to be in a three-year cumulative U.S. loss position.

During 2012 and 2011, objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as U.S. operating losses and significant impairment charges for U.S. goodwill in 2011 and other intangible assets, continued to outweigh
positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance. As a result, the Company recorded increases of $65 million and $89 million in the valuation allowance against its U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax
expense in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Recording the valuation allowance does not restrict the Company’s ability to utilize the
future deductions and net operating losses associated with the deferred tax assets assuming taxable income is recognized in future periods.

A rebound in the U.S. housing market from the recent historic lows and retail sales of building products improving from their current levels should have a positive impact on the Company’s operating results in
the U.S. A return to sustained profitability in the U.S. should result in objective positive evidence thereby warranting the potential reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance.

The $203 million and $156 million of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for which there is no valuation allowance
recorded, is anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities.

Of the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2012 $411 million will expire between 2020 and 2032 and $14 million is unlimited. Of the deferred tax
asset related to the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2011 $269 million will expire between 2020 and 2031 and $11 million is unlimited.

The tax benefit from certain stock-based compensation is not recognized as a deferred tax asset until the tax deduction reduces cash taxes. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2012, the Company has



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

R.  INCOME TAXES (Continued)

not recorded a $27 million deferred tax asset on additional net operating losses that, when realized, will be recorded to paid-in capital.

A tax provision has not been provided at December 31, 2012 for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $10
million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred tax liability on such earnings as the actual U.S. tax would depend on
income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution.

A reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to the income tax
expense (benefit) on income (loss) from continuing operations was as follows:

Income taxes paid were $57 million, $43 million and $47 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

R.  INCOME TAXES (Continued)

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions, including
related interest and penalties, is as follows:

If recognized, $34 million and $40 million of the liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2012
and 2011, respectively, net of any U.S. Federal tax benefit, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

At December 31,
2012 and 2011, $74 and $86 million of the total liability for uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, is recorded in deferred income taxes and other, $1 and $1 million is recorded in accrued liabilities and $7 and $6
million is recorded in other assets, respectively.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, and various
local, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company continues to participate in the Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). CAP is a real-time audit of the U.S. Federal income tax return that allows the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”), working in conjunction with the Company, to determine tax return compliance with the U.S. Federal tax law prior to filing the return. This program provides the Company with greater certainty about its tax liability for a given
year within months, rather than years, of filing its annual tax return and greatly reduces the need for recording a liability for U.S. Federal uncertain tax positions. The IRS has completed their examination of the Company’s consolidated U.S.
Federal tax returns through 2011. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state or foreign income tax examinations on filed returns for years before 2000.

R.  INCOME TAXES (Concluded)

As a result of tax audit closings, settlements and the expiration of applicable statutes of
limitations in various jurisdictions within the next 12 months, the Company anticipates that it is reasonably possible the liability for uncertain tax positions could be reduced by approximately $6 million.

S.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used in the computations of basic and diluted earnings per common share were
as follows, in millions:

The Company follows accounting guidance regarding determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment
transactions are participating securities. This accounting guidance clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends prior to vesting should be considered participating securities. The Company
has granted restricted stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends on unvested shares; such unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities. As participating securities, the unvested shares are required to
be included in the calculation of the Company’s basic earnings per common share, using the “two-class method.” The two-class method of computing earnings per common share is an allocation method that calculates earnings per share for
each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company allocated dividends to the unvested
restricted stock awards (participating securities).

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not include any common shares
related to the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes (“Notes”) in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share, as the price of the Company’s common stock at December 31, 2010 did not exceed the equivalent accreted value
of the Notes.

Additionally, 30 million common shares, 36 million common shares and 37 million common shares for 2012,
2011 and 2010, respectively, related to stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share due to their antidilutive effect.

Common shares outstanding included on the Company’s balance sheet and for the calculation of earnings per common share do not include unvested stock awards (8 million shares and 10 million

T.  OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

We are subject to claims, charges, litigation and other proceedings in the ordinary
course of our business, including those arising from or related to contractual matters, intellectual property, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, construction defect, insurance coverage, personnel and employment disputes and
other matters, including class actions. We believe we have adequate defenses in these matters and that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on us. However, there is no assurance that we will prevail in these
matters, and we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of these matters, which could materially impact our results of operations.

In July 2012, the Company reached a settlement agreement related to the Columbus Drywall litigation. The Company and its insulation installation
companies named in the suit agreed to pay $75 million in return for dismissal with prejudice and full release of all claims. The Company and its insulation installation companies continue to deny that the challenged conduct was unlawful and admit no
wrongdoing as part of the settlement. A settlement was reached to eliminate the considerable expense and uncertainty of this lawsuit. The Company recorded the settlement expense in the second quarter of 2012 and the amount was paid in the fourth
quarter of 2012.

Warranty.

At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for the estimated
cost to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. During the third quarter of 2012, a business in the Other Specialty Products segment recorded a $12 million increase in expected
future warranty claims resulting from the completion of an analysis prepared by the Company based upon its periodic assessment of recent business unit specific operating trends including, among others, home ownership demographics, sales volumes,
manufacturing quality, an analysis of recent warranty claim activity and an estimate of current costs to service anticipated claims.

Other Matters.

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are
standard for the industries in which it operates. Such indemnifications include customer claims against builders for issues relating to the Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company
occasionally provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset valuations. The Company has never had to
pay a material amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an estimated liability when probable.

U.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In early February 2013, the Company determined that its Danish ready-to-assemble cabinet business was no longer core to our
long-term growth strategy and, accordingly the Company embarked on a plan for disposition. This business unit had 2012 sales of approximately $250 million and an operating loss of approximately $30 million. The disposition is expected to be
