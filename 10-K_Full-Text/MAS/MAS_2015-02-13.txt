PART I

Item 1.    Business.

Masco Corporation manufactures, distributes and installs home improvement and building products, with an emphasis on brand-name
consumer products and services holding leadership positions. We are among the largest manufacturers in North America of a number of home improvement and building products, including faucets, cabinets,
architectural coatings and windows, and we are a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products. We provide broad product offerings in a variety
of styles and price points and distribute products through multiple channels, including directly to homebuilders and wholesale and retail channels. Approximately 81 percent of our 2014 sales
were generated by our North American operations.

The
market for home improvement and building products at retailers increased by approximately four percent during 2014, despite continued economic uncertainties and modest consumer
spending. Housing starts increased approximately ten percent during 2014.

Throughout
2014, we continued the execution of our strategy to position the Company for future growth, focusing on three strategic pillars: leveraging opportunities across our
businesses, driving the full potential of our core businesses and actively managing our portfolio. We achieved gains in each of these areas. First, we leveraged our product leadership positions by
expanding our brands and introducing innovative new and improved products. We believe that we gained share in our North American plumbing business with our DELTA®, PEERLESS®,
and BRIZO® brands, and internationally with our HANSGROHE® products. In addition to its strong position with the "do-it-yourself" consumer, our decorative architectural
products businesses continued to focus on the professional segment with BEHRPRO® paint and KILZ® PRO-X product lines. BEHR® paint expanded its MARQUEE®
product line from exterior paint to interior paint and continued to pursue international opportunities. Milgard Manufacturing, our manufacturer of windows in the western U.S., and our U.K. Window
Group continued to gain share.

To
help drive the full potential of our core businesses, the second pillar of our strategy, we adopted a leaner operating model. We are transforming our corporate structure to a
center-led model. We believe this model will increase our business units' efficiencies and our overall effectiveness as an organization. This change will align our corporate structure to support our
strategy to drive the full potential of our businesses. In addition, we continued reducing costs and implementing lean principles and production process improvements. Our Installation and Other
Services segments saw progress toward its goals during 2014 through incremental new home construction activity, cost reductions from lean processes and leveraging our ERP system and supply chain
savings. During 2014, we remained focused on improvements at our Cabinets and Related Products businesses, which continued to face challenges.

The
third pillar of our strategy is to actively manage our portfolio. In September 2014, we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our Installation and Other Services
businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company through a tax-free stock distribution to our shareholders. We believe that these businesses will be better positioned to operate as a separate
company that will focus on growth by capitalizing on new home construction in the United States as well as further expanding into commercial and retrofit categories. The transaction is expected to be
completed in mid-2015.

To
further drive value creation for our shareholders, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of an aggregate 50 million shares of our common stock and increased our
dividend by 20 percent. During 2014, we repurchased 7 million shares (including 1.7 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of 2014 to offset the dilutive impact of
long-term stock awards) of our common stock. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits.

We
believe that the actions we took during 2014 help provide the foundation for us to enhance future shareholder value. We also believe that the spin-off of our Installation and Other
Services businesses will allow us to pursue a more focused strategy of growth through the innovation and manufacturing of



branded
building products. We plan to continue to actively manage our portfolio, identify growth opportunities in key industries and produce new products that differentiate us in the marketplace. By
continuing our disciplined execution of our strategy, we believe that we will increase shareholder value by enhancing our customer experience and improving our efficiencies.

Our Business Segments

We report our financial results in five business segments aggregated by similarity in products and services. The following table sets
forth the contribution of our segments to net sales and operating profit (loss) for the three years ended December 31, 2014. Additional financial information concerning our operations by

All

for new home construction and repair and remodel activity.



Cabinets and Related Products

In North America, we manufacture and sell value-priced, stock and semi-custom assembled cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home
office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points to address consumer preferences. We have also expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the
manufacture and sale of kitchen countertops, as well as an integrated bathroom vanity and countertop solution. In the United Kingdom, we manufacture and sell assembled and ready-to-assemble kitchen,
bath, and storage cabinetry. Our KRAFTMAID® brand is sold primarily to dealers, home centers and mass merchants and our MERILLAT®, MOORES™ and QUALITY
CABINETS™ brands are sold primarily to dealers and homebuilders for both home improvement and new home construction. Cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both
new home construction and retail consumer spending, particularly spending for major kitchen and bathroom renovation projects. A significant portion of our sales for home improvement are made through
home center retailers.

Our
Cabinets and Related Products segment was particularly affected by the economic downturn and decline in new home construction and repair and remodel activity. While improving,
consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects, including large kitchen and bath remodeling projects, continues to be below normal levels, which impacts our profitability. Although home
construction is improving and is expected to continue to improve, the demand for new homes remains below the historic average and demand has increased for multi-family housing units, which are smaller
than single-family housing units and require fewer cabinets for the kitchen and bathrooms. In addition, our initiatives to improve this segment, including rationalizing our businesses, closing plants
and reducing headcount, have been complex, time-consuming and expensive. The consolidation of our North American cabinet businesses has involved the integration of multiple manufacturing processes and
information technology platforms and continues to affect our operations. We continue to focus on our cost structure in this segment and improving cabinet production efficiencies. Although faced with
challenges, we are continuing to pursue our strategy to increase sales in this segment through brand building, new product introductions aimed to provide differentiated products to our multiple sales
channels, and product innovation.

The
cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States and the United Kingdom includes several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors. In recent years, we have
experienced significant competition in the form of discounts and new product offerings by our
competitors, which have impacted the segment's results of operations. We also face competition from foreign manufacturers. In addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based
largely on product quality, responsiveness to customer needs, product features and selection. Our North American competitors include American Woodmark Corporation, Fortune Brands Home &
Security, Inc. and Norcraft Companies, Inc.

The
raw materials used in this segment are primarily hardwood lumber, plywood and particleboard, and are available from multiple sources, both domestic and foreign.

Plumbing Products

The businesses in our Plumbing Products segment sell a wide variety of faucet, bathing and showering devices that are manufactured by
or for us. The majority of our plumbing products are sold in North America and Europe under the brand names DELTA®, PEERLESS®, HANSGROHE®, AXOR®,
BRIZO®, BRASSTECH®, BRISTAN™, GINGER®, HERITAGE™, NEWPORT BRASS® and PLUMB SHOP®. Our products include single-handle
and double-handle faucets, showerheads, handheld showers, valves, bathing units and toilets. These products are sold to major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors that, in turn, sell
our products to plumbers, building contractors, remodelers, smaller retailers and others.



Our
spas are manufactured and sold under HOT SPRING®, CALDERA®, FREEFLOW® and other trademarks directly to independent specialty retailers as well as
through online mass merchant retailers. Competitors include Jacuzzi, Sundance Spas, Master Spas and Dynasty Spas. We sell HÜPPE® shower enclosures through wholesale channels
in Europe. HERITAGE™ ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally sold in the United Kingdom directly to select retailers.

In
2014, we completed the process of integrating our plumbing products sold under our AQUA GLASS® and AMERICAN SHOWER & BATH™ brands into the DELTA and
PEERLESS brands. Our acrylic tub and shower systems, bath and shower enclosure units, shower
trays and laundry tubs are now manufactured and sold under the DELTA, PEERLESS, and MIROLIN® brand names. These products are sold primarily to home center retailers for home improvement
and new home construction in North America, although our MIROLIN products are also sold to wholesalers and distributors in Canada.

Also
included in our Plumbing Products segment are brass and copper plumbing system components and other plumbing specialties, which are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware
wholesalers and to home center retailers, hardware stores, building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These products are marketed in North America for the wholesale trade under our
BRASSCRAFT®, COBRA®, PLUMB SHOP®, and BRASSTECH®, and MASTER PLUMBER® trademarks, and are also sold under private label.

We
believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in North America and Europe, with American Standard Brands, Kohler Co., Fortune Brands Home &
Security Inc. and Pfister Faucets as major competitors. We are also experiencing competition from foreign manufacturers, including Grohe, particularly in Germany, China and the Middle East. We
face significant competition from private label products (including house brands sold by certain of our customers). Many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are
manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressure on price. The businesses in our Plumbing Products segment source products primarily from Asia and manufacture products in the
United States, Europe and Asia. In addition to price, we believe that competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation, product quality, product innovation and features and
breadth of product offering.

A
substantial portion of our plumbing products contain brass, the major components of which are copper and zinc. We have multiple sources, both domestic and foreign, for the raw
materials used in this segment, and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs. We have encountered price volatility for brass, brass components and any components containing copper
and zinc; therefore, we have implemented a hedging strategy to help reduce the impact of this volatility.

Federal
legislation mandating a national standard for lead content in plumbing products used to convey drinking water became effective in January 2014. Faucet and water supply valve
manufacturers, including our plumbing product companies, are required to obtain adequate supplies of lead-free brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets and certain
of our other plumbing products. Our plumbing products that are affected by this legislation meet the federal standards, including our Delta Faucet products that use DIAMOND™ SEAL
TECHNOLOGY, which also reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet and simplifies installation.

Installation and Other Services

Our Installation and Other Services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily for new home
construction, and, to a lesser extent, retrofit and commercial construction, throughout the United States. In addition to insulation, we sell installed gutters, after-paint products, garage doors and
fireplaces. The installation and distribution of insulation comprised approximately thirteen percent, twelve percent and eleven percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. We install building products primarily to homebuilders through our network of branches located across the United States. Our distributed products include insulation, insulation



accessories,
gutters and roofing, among others. Distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers (including lumber yards) from distribution centers in various parts of the United
States.

We
continue to pursue the expansion of this segment to serve the residential and commercial channels and custom homes and we have several initiatives related to improved residential
energy efficiency, including retrofit installation services (primarily insulation) delivered directly to homeowners and traditional remodeling contractors, as well as through retailers and dealer
outlets.

In
addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of installation service. We believe that we are a leading provider
of installed insulation in the new home construction industry in the United States. Our competitors include Installed Building Products and several regional contractors, as well as numerous local
contractors and lumber yards. We believe that our capabilities and financial resources are substantial compared to regional and local contractors.

We
procure the materials used by this segment, primarily insulation, from multiple sources.

Decorative Architectural Products

We produce architectural coatings including paints, primers, specialty paint products, stains and waterproofing products. The products
are sold in the United States, Canada, China, Mexico and South America under the brand names BEHRPRO®, BEHR® and KILZ® to "do-it-yourself" and professional
customers through home centers and other retailers. Net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 21 percent in 2014 and 2013 and approximately 20 percent of our
consolidated net sales in 2012. Our competitors include large national and international brands such as Benjamin Moore, Glidden, Olympic, PPG, Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Zinsser, as well as many
regional and other national brands. In addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality, technology and product innovation, customer service and
brand reputation. In 2014, Behr introduced MARQUEE® Interior Paint that delivers high-performance, one-coat coverage with every color in the exclusive MARQUEE Interior One-Coat Color
Collection.

Our
BEHR products are principally sold through The Home Depot, this segment's and our largest customer. The loss of this segment's sales to The Home Depot would have a material adverse
effect on this segment's business and on our consolidated business as a whole.

Titanium
dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint. The price for titanium dioxide can fluctuate as a result of surges in global demand and production capacity
limitations, which can impact our operating results in this segment. Petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings. Significant increases in the cost of crude oil and
natural gas lead to higher raw material costs (e.g., for resins, solvents and packaging, as well as titanium dioxide), which can adversely affect the segment's results of operations. We have
agreements with the significant suppliers of the major raw materials used in this segment which are intended to help assure continued availability.

Our
Decorative Architectural Products segment also includes LIBERTY® and BRAINERD® branded cabinet, door, window and other hardware, which is manufactured for us
and sold to home centers, other retailers, original equipment manufacturers and wholesalers. Key competitors in North America include Amerock, Top Knobs and house brands. Decorative bath hardware and
shower accessories are sold under the brand names DELTA®, FRANKLIN BRASS® and DECOR BATHWARE® to distributors, home centers and other retailers. Competitors include
Moen, Gatco and house brands sold by certain of our customers.

Other Specialty Products

We manufacture and sell vinyl, fiberglass and aluminum windows and patio doors, as well as the ESSENCE SERIES® windows and
doors, which combines a wood interior with a fiberglass exterior,



under
the MILGARD® brand name for home improvement and new home construction, principally in the western United States. MILGARD products are sold primarily through dealers and, to a lesser
extent, directly to production and custom homebuilders and through lumber yards and home centers. This segment's competitors in North America include national brands, such as Jeld-Wen, Marvin, Pella
and Andersen, and numerous regional brands.

In
the United Kingdom, we manufacture and sell windows, doors, related products and components under several brand names including GRIFFIN™, PREMIER™ and
DURAFLEX™. Sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the repair and remodeling markets, although our DURAFLEX products are also sold to other window fabricators. United
Kingdom competitors include many small and mid-sized firms and a few large, vertically integrated competitors.

In
addition to price, we believe that competition in this industry in both the domestic and foreign markets is based largely on customer service, product quality and brand reputation.

We
manufacture and sell a complete line of manual and electric staple gun tackers, staples and other fastening tools under the brand names ARROW® and POWERSHOT®.
We sell these products through various distribution channels including home centers and other retailers and wholesalers. Our principal North American competitor in this product line is Stanley
Black & Decker.

The
raw materials used in this segment have been available from multiple sources.

Additional Information

We hold U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing
processes. As a manufacturer and distributor of brand name products, we view our trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important, but do not believe that there is any reasonable
likelihood of a loss of such rights that would have a material adverse effect on our present business as a whole.

We
are subject to U.S. and foreign government regulations, particularly those pertaining to health and safety (including protection of employees and consumers), climate disruption and
environmental issues. In addition to our responsibilities for environmental remediation, our businesses are subject to other requirements regarding protection of the environment and worker health and
safety. Our businesses are subject to requirements relating to the emission of volatile organic compounds which may impact our sourcing of particleboard and may require that we install special
equipment in manufacturing facilities or that we reformulate paint products. As described above, our Plumbing Products segment is subject to restrictions on lead content in some of its products.
Compliance with such laws and regulations could significantly affect product performance as well as our production costs. We monitor applicable laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment, climate disruption and worker health and safety, and incur ongoing expense relating to compliance. We do not expect compliance with the federal, state and local regulations relating to
the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety, will result in material capital expenditures or have a
material adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position.

We
do not consider backlog orders to be material in any of our segments.

At
December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 32,000 people. We have generally experienced satisfactory relations with our employees.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.

There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business. These risks and uncertainties could cause our
actual results to differ from past performance or expected results. We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to our Business

A significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity, both of which are cyclical.

A significant portion of our business relies on home improvement, including spending on repair and remodeling projects, and new home
construction activity, principally in North America and Europe. Macroeconomic conditions, including consumer confidence levels, fluctuations in home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels,
student loan debt, household formation and the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for such loans, affect both consumers' discretionary spending on home improvement
projects as well as new home construction activity. Adverse changes or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a
decline in demand for new home construction, both of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position. While improving, both new home construction and consumer
spending for big ticket remodeling projects continue to be below historic average levels.

If we do not maintain strong brands or respond to changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices, we could lose share and our results could be adversely affected.

Our competitive advantage is due, in part, to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and
improved products. While we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness, these initiatives may not be successful. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and
improved products, such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling these products, may impact the success of our product introductions.
If we do not introduce
new or improved products in a timely manner or if these products do not gain widespread acceptance, we could lose share, which could negatively impact our operating results.

The
challenging economic environment of recent years has caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and changes in the business models and strategies of our
customers. Consumers are increasingly using the internet and mobile technology to research home improvement products and to inform and provide feedback on their purchasing and ownership experience for
these products. E-business is a rapidly developing area, and development of a successful e-business strategy involves significant time, investment and resources. If we are unable to successfully
execute our e-business strategy, our brands may lose share.

Similarly,
the quantity, type and prices of products demanded by consumers and our customers have shifted. For example, demand has increased for multi-family housing units such as
apartments and condominiums, which typically have smaller kitchens and smaller and fewer bathrooms, each with fewer cabinets and faucets, as well as less insulation, than single-family houses. While
the economy is recovering, we are experiencing growth in certain channels for lower price point products. In some of our segments, these shifts have negatively impacted our sales and/or our
profitability, and it is uncertain whether these shifts represent long-term changes in consumer preferences.



If
we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices, our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be
harmed, the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations could be negatively affected.

We may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic and operational initiatives or our actions to improve our underperforming cabinetry businesses.

In 2014, we announced new strategic initiatives, which are designed to increase shareholder value over the mid- to long-term. Our
business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to execute these strategic initiatives, or if we are unable to execute them in a timely and efficient manner. We have also
identified a number of operational initiatives, which include making significant investments in technology systems that are key to
managing our business. We could be adversely affected if we do not effectively implement our operational initiatives in a timely manner.

The
downturn in home improvement and new home construction activity during the recent recession impacted our results, particularly at our cabinetry businesses. In response, we have
implemented initiatives to reduce costs and increase sales; however, there is no assurance that our efforts will yield all of the anticipated benefits. Our initiatives to improve our cabinetry
operations, including rationalizing our businesses, closing plants and reducing headcount, have been complex, time-consuming and expensive. The consolidation of our North American Cabinet businesses,
in particular, involved the integration of multiple manufacturing processes and information technology platforms and continues to affect our operations.

Our
strategy to increase our cabinetry businesses' sales through brand building, enhanced customer relationships and new product introductions requires time to implement, execute and
assess. Further, these businesses continue to face pricing pressures, competition from low-cost manufacturers and a shift in the mix of products in certain channels to more value-priced products. If
our strategy to increase our sales is not successful, our results of operations may continue to be negatively impacted.

Our sales are concentrated with two significant customers.

The size and importance of individual customers to our businesses continues to increase. In 2014, net sales to our largest customer,
The Home Depot, were $2.3 billion (approximately 27 percent of consolidated net sales). Lowe's is our second largest customer. In 2014, sales to Lowe's were less than ten percent of our
consolidated net sales. These home center customers may reduce the number of vendors they purchase from and can make significant changes in their volume of purchases. Additionally, home centers can
significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services, our cost of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business. If the mix of our business
operations significantly changes, including as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, our reliance on these significant customers may increase. Although homebuilders, dealers and other retailers
represent other channels of distribution for our products and services, the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to The Home Depot or the loss of our sales to Lowe's would have a material
adverse effect on our business.

Further,
as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers, conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur, which could
impact our results of operations. We may undermine the business relationships we have with our current customers if we increase the amount of business we transact directly with consumers. In addition,
our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity, which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may diminish our ability to leverage economies of
scale.



We face significant competition.

Our products and services face significant competition. We believe that we compete on the basis of price, product and service quality,
brand reputation, customer service and product features and innovation. Home centers continue to purchase select products in our segments directly from low-cost foreign manufacturers for sale as
private label and house brand merchandise. Additionally, home centers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers, are increasingly marketing directly
to professional contractors and installers, which may impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers.

In
our other distribution channels, we compete with foreign manufacturers in a variety of our product groups. These foreign manufacturers are putting downward pressures on price. In some
of our segments, we are continuing to experience a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more value-priced or opening price point products, which may impact our ability to maintain or gain
share and our profitability.

Our
ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries and to grow our businesses depends upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers, implementing
growth strategies and entering new geographic areas, including successful international penetration, developing a successful e-business strategy, maintaining strong brands, managing our cost
structure, accommodating shorter life-cycles for our products, and developing and innovating products, none of which is assured.

If we experience increased commodity costs or limited availability of commodities, our operating results could be negatively impacted.

We buy various commodities to manufacture our products, including, among others, wood, brass (made of copper and zinc), titanium
dioxide and resins. Fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase our costs to manufacture our products. Further, increases in energy costs could increase our
production costs as well as our transportation costs, each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.

It
has been, and likely will continue to be, difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs. Our existing arrangements with
customers, competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices. If we are not able to increase the prices of our products or
achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. If we are able to increase our selling prices,
sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of share, particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices. When commodity prices decline, we may receive
pressure from our customers to reduce our prices.

To
help reduce price volatility associated with certain anticipated commodity purchases, we use derivative instruments, including commodity futures and swaps. This strategy may increase
the possibility that we may make commitments to purchase these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.

We are dependent on third-party suppliers and manufacturers, and the loss of a key supplier or manufacturer could negatively affect our operating results.

Our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of products and components from
manufacturers and other suppliers. We rely heavily or, in certain cases, exclusively, on third-party suppliers for some of our products and key components. Failure by our suppliers to provide us
quality products on commercially reasonable terms, or to comply with applicable legal requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or operating results. Resourcing these products and components to another supplier could take time and involve significant



costs.
Accordingly, the loss of a key supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers, could disrupt our business and adversely impact our
operating results.

Further,
we manufacture products in Asia and source products and components from third parties in Asia. The distances involved in these arrangements, together with differences in
business practices, shipping and delivery requirements, the limited number of suppliers, and laws and regulations, have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for
interruptions in our production scheduling. If we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain, our operating results could be negatively affected.

If we cannot adequately protect or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property we may be adversely affected.

Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own a number of patents, trade names, brand names and
other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will
prevent violations. Our intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected. In addition,
the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms. Furthermore, others may assert intellectual
property infringement claims against us. If we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights, or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, sales of our products may be
affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names, increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position, which could affect our results of operations.

International political, monetary, economic and social developments affect our business.

Approximately 19 percent of our sales are made outside of North America (principally in Europe) and are transacted in currencies
other than U.S. dollars (principally the Euro and the British pound sterling). Increasing our international sales is an important part of our future strategic plans. In addition, we manufacture
products in Asia and source products, components and raw materials from third parties in Asia. We face risks associated with changes in political, monetary, economic and social environments, labor
conditions and practices, the laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. U.S. laws and
regulations affecting activities of U.S. companies doing business abroad, including tax laws, laws regulating various business practices, and trade regulations which may include duties and tariffs can
also impact us. Our international operating results may also be influenced by economic conditions in Europe. In addition, our financial results could be adversely affected by the currency conversion
rate if the U.S. dollar strengthens in value relative to foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating
performance from period to period.

The long-term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented personnel.

To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel who have the experience, knowledge and
expertise to successfully implement our key business strategies. We compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries, including large multinational firms, and we
invest significant resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract and retain key employees, or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth
transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess, could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results. Further, as the economy continues to recover,
if we are unable to recruit, train and retain sufficient skilled labor, we may not be able to



adequately
satisfy increased demand for our products and services, which could impact our operating results.

Claims and litigation could be costly.

We are, from time to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course
of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract disputes, automobile liability and other personal injury claims, warranty disputes,
environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions.

We
are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be
costly to defend or manage. Also, we rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell. Due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or
components sourced from other manufacturers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.

We
have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations, product liability and wage and hour issues. We have generally denied
liability and have vigorously defended these cases. Due to their scope and complexity, however, these lawsuits can be particularly costly to defend and resolve, and we have and may continue to incur
significant costs as a result of these types of lawsuits.

Our
homebuilder customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with these customers may
include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities. These claims, often asserted several years after completion of construction, can result in complex lawsuits or claims
against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors, including us, and may require us to incur defense and indemnity costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the
claims.

Although
we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the
outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter.

We
maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available
insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant accident, judgment,
claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

See
Note U to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses.

If we are required to take additional significant non-cash charges, our financial resources could be reduced and our financial flexibility may be negatively affected.

We have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets related to prior business combinations on our balance sheet. The
valuation of these assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses. Expectations about the growth of new home construction and home improvement activity may
impact whether we are required to recognize additional non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets. If the value of our
goodwill or other intangible assets is further impaired, our earnings and shareholders' equity would be adversely affected.



Further,
our credit agreement contains financial covenants we must comply with, including covenants regarding limits on our debt to total capitalization ratio. If we are required to
record additional non-cash impairment charges, our shareholders' equity would be reduced, and our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement may be limited. We have negotiated amendments to our
credit agreement to allow for the add-back to shareholders' equity for impairment charges we have taken. There can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend our credit
agreement, that alternative financing would be available on acceptable terms and at acceptable
rates, or that we would be permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements.

Compliance with government regulation and industry standards could impact our operating results.

We are subject to federal, state and foreign government regulations, particularly those pertaining to health and safety (including
protection of employees and consumers), climate disruption and environmental issues. In addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date,
even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future. Additionally, some of our products must be certified by industry organizations. Compliance with these regulations and industry
standards may require us to alter our product designs, our manufacturing and installation processes or our sourcing. Such actions could divert our attention and resources to compliance activities, and
could cause us to incur higher costs. Further, if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards, our results of operations could be negatively affected.

Our operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions.

We rely on a number of information technology systems to process, transmit, store and manage information to support our business
activities. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security
policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of
our operations. Despite these efforts, our systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other
events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or
confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to litigation, and increased operational costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operation. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business
operations or damage their reputation.

Risks Related to our Proposed Spin-off Transaction

We are pursuing a plan to spin-off our Installation and Other Services segment (our "Services Business"). We are incurring significant costs in connection with this transaction, which also requires
considerable time and attention of our management, and we may not be able to complete the transaction or, if the transaction is completed, realize the anticipated benefits.

In September 2014, we announced a plan to separate our Services Business from our other businesses through a spin-off transaction in
which we would distribute the common stock of the Services Business to our existing shareholders in a tax-free transaction. Completion of the transaction will be contingent upon approval by our Board
of Directors, our receipt of an opinion from tax counsel, the



effectiveness
of a Registration Statement on Form 10, and certain other conditions. Additionally, our ability to complete the spin-off in a timely manner, if at all, could be affected by
several factors, including:

•

our ability to obtain sufficient financing for the newly-created entity on acceptable terms;

•

our ability to obtain any necessary consents or approvals;

•

changes in the underlying businesses, contracts, or customers; and

•

political and economic conditions at the time of the transaction.

For
these and other reasons, we may not be able to complete the spin-off within the expected time frame or at all. Even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the
anticipated benefits from the spin-off. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with this transaction, which will affect our profitability and operating results
through completion of the transaction. Executing the proposed spin-off also requires considerable time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our
business and executing our other strategic initiatives.

The proposed spin-off of our Services Business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.

Among the conditions to completing the spin-off will be our receipt of an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify for tax-free treatment under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the factual
assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct
of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinion. Furthermore, the opinion will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or the courts. If, notwithstanding receipt of the
opinion, the spin-off transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off transaction is
taxable, each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new Services Business company would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the
fair market value of the shares received, thereby potentially increasing such holder's tax liability.

Even
if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significant
acquisitions of our stock or the stock of the new Services Business company are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin-off. In this event, the resulting
tax liability could be substantial. In connection with the spin-off, we expect to enter into a tax matters agreement with the new Services Business company, under which it will agree not to enter into
any transaction without our consent that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to us and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction. These obligations
and potential tax liabilities may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us or of the new Services Business company.

On
January 31, 2015, there were approximately 4,500 holders of record of our common stock.

We
expect that our practice of paying quarterly dividends on our common stock will continue, although the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and
will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors.

In
September 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 50 million shares, for retirement of our common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise,
replacing the previous authorization established in 2007. During 2014, we repurchased and retired 7 million shares of our common stock (including 1.7 million shares repurchased in the
first quarter of 2014 to offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards) for cash aggregating $158 million. The following table provides information regarding the repurchase of our common
stock for the three months ended December 31, 2014:

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

The
following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute "forward-looking statements" under
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "appear," "may," "will," "should," "intend," "plan,"
"estimate," "expect," "assume," "seek," "forecast" and similar references to future periods. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual
results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. We caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. In addition to the various
factors included in the "Executive Level Overview," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Outlook for the Company" sections, our future performance may be affected by our reliance on new
home construction and home improvement, our reliance on key customers, the cost and availability of raw materials, uncertainty in the international economy, shifts in consumer preferences and
purchasing practices, our ability to improve our underperforming businesses, our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries, risks associated with the proposed spin-off of our
Installation and Other Services businesses, our ability to realize the expected benefits of the spin-off, the timing and the terms of our share repurchase program, and our ability to reduce corporate
expense and simplify our organizational structure. These and other factors are discussed in detail in Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Report. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only
as of the date on which it was made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Unless required
by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Executive Level Overview

We manufacture, distribute and install home improvement and building products. These products are sold for home improvement and new
home construction through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, homebuilders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer.

2014 Results

Net sales were positively affected by increased new home construction and repair and remodel activity in the U.S. and Europe. Such
increases were partially offset by
decreased sales volume in our North American cabinetry business. Our results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume, as well as a more favorable relationship between selling
prices and commodity costs, except in paints and stains. Our results of operations were negatively affected by increased business rationalization costs and costs associated with our proposed spin-off
transaction. Most of our business segments also benefited from the business rationalizations and cost savings initiatives we have undertaken over the last several years.

Our
Cabinets and Related Products segment was negatively affected by lower sales volume of our North American operations, which completely offset a more favorable relationship between
selling prices and commodity costs and any increased sales volume by our U.K. cabinet business. Our Plumbing Products segment benefited from increased sales volume of North American and International
operations, as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. The Installation and Other Services segment benefited from increased new home construction and



commercial
activity and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. The Decorative Architectural Products segment benefited from increased sales volume of paints and
stains and builders' hardware, which was offset by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs in paints and stains. Our Other Specialty Products segment benefited from a
more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and a more favorable product mix of U.S. and U.K. windows, as well as increased sales volume.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and
various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities
that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Note A
to our consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies, estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

We
believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition and Receivables

We recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. We record revenue
for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of material and labor incurred in the Installation and Other Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables. Receivables include
unbilled revenue related to the Installation and Other Services segment of $24 million at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. In addition, we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on-going
basis.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other
identifiable intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. We selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to
what would be used by other market
participants. We have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level, as defined by accounting guidance.

Determining
market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions
and



appropriate
discount rates. Our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While we believe that
the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes. In estimating future cash flows, we rely on
internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for
periods after the five-year forecast. We generally develop these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated
housing starts and estimated repair and remodel activity.

In
2014, we utilized estimated housing starts, from independent industry sources, growing from current levels to 1.45 million units in 2019 (terminal growth year) and operating
profit margins improving to approximate historical levels for those business units by 2019 (terminal growth year). We utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9 percent as
the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. Our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2014 primarily due to lower bond rates. In 2014, based upon our
assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses, we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 11.0 percent to 14.0 percent for our reporting units.

If
the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting
unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair value of a reporting
unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of goodwill.

In
the fourth quarter of 2014, we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values. Accordingly, we did not
recognize any impairment charges for goodwill.

A
10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at December 31, 2014 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for
any additional reporting unit.

We
review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired
without regard to the business unit. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and
expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term. In 2014, we recognized an insignificant impairment charge for
other indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Employee Retirement Plans

Effective January 1, 2010, we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and
non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans.

Accounting
for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon vested years of service, and attributing those costs over
the time period each employee works. We develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on
plan assets, mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in
assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2014, our discount rate decreased for obligations to an average of 3.80 percent from 4.40 percent. The discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected
duration of each defined-



benefit
pension plan's liabilities matched to the December 31, 2014 Towers Watson Rate Link curve. The discount rates we use for our defined-benefit pension plans ranged from
2.00 percent to 4.00 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of
3.70 percent or higher. The assumed asset return was primarily 7.25 percent, reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.

Our
net underfunded amount for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, increased to
$454 million at December 31, 2014 from $324 million at December 31, 2013. Our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans was
$190 million at December 31, 2014 compared with $163 million at December 31, 2013.

The
increase in the projected benefit obligations was primarily due to lower bond rates and a change to the RP 2014 Mortality tables issued by the U.S. Society of Actuaries, which
increased our long-term pension liabilities. Our qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2014 had a net gain of 3.6 percent compared to average gains of 9.5 percent for the
InvestorForce Defined Benefit Plan Universe.

At
December 31, 2014, we reported a net liability of $644 million, of which $190 million was related to our non-qualified, supplemental retirement plans, which are
not subject to the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. In accordance with the Pension Protection Act, the Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage for the various
defined-benefit pension plans ranges from 79 percent to 90 percent.

We
expect pension expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $23 million in 2015 compared with $16 million in 2014. If we assumed that the future return
on plan assets was one-half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points, the 2015 pension expense would increase by $5 million. We expect
pension expense for our non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $10 million in 2015 compared with $9 million in 2014.

We
anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately $55 million to $65 million in 2015 to our qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit plans.

Income Taxes

The accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of
sufficient taxable income in future
periods. Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability,
tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.

If,
based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a
valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company's three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative
evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the
deferred tax assets.

In
2010, we recorded a $372 million valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. In reaching this conclusion, we
considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the U.S. housing market which led to U.S. operating losses and significant U.S.
goodwill impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative U.S. loss position.

During
2012 and 2011, objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as U.S. operating losses and significant impairment charges for U.S. goodwill in 2011 and other intangible assets,
continued to



outweigh
positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance. As a result, we recorded increases of $65 million and $87 million in the valuation allowance related to our U.S.
Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

In
the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal and certain state deferred tax assets due
primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our U.S. operations. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and
remodel activity in the U.S. and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our U.S. operations
over the past few years.

In
the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an additional $12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain U.K. and Mexican deferred tax assets
primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions.

We
continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize
our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. The need to maintain a
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.

It
is reasonably possible that the continued improvements in certain of our businesses located in the U.S. could result in the objective positive evidence necessary to warrant the
additional reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance, up to approximately $27 million, by the end of 2015.

The
current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the
taxing authorities. We believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent
complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent.

While
we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions.
Accordingly, additional provisions for tax-related matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters
are settled or otherwise resolved.

Warranty

At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace
products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. Our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the
warranty coverage, the warranty period, historical experience specific to the nature, frequency and average cost to service the claim, along with product manufacturing metrics and industry and
demographic trends.

Certain
factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors. We believe that
the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals.



A majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us. Our revenue recognition policy takes into
account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale.

Litigation

We are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business. Liabilities and costs associated with
these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel. When estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted
claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments.

Corporate Development Strategy

Our business strategy includes expanding our product leadership and implementing lean principles and product process improvements
across our business units. Going forward, we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow, organic growth with smaller acquisitions and growth through new product
development.

As
part of our strategic planning, we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our long-term growth strategy.

On
September 30, 2014, we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our Installation and Other Services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company through a
tax-free stock distribution to our shareholders. The transaction is expected to be completed in mid-2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations, long-term bank debt and the issuance of notes
in the financial markets, and by the issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are
among our financial strategies.

Our
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 75 percent and 81 percent at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

On
March 28, 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of
March 28, 2018.

The
Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (A) a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio, as adjusted for certain items, of 65 percent,
and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, equal to or greater than 2.5 to 1.0. The debt to total capitalization ratio allows the add-back, if incurred, of up to
the first $250 million of certain non-cash charges, including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, occurring from and after January 1, 2012 that would negatively
impact shareholders' equity.

At
December 31, 2014, we had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $1.2 billion. Alternatively, at December 31, 2014, we could absorb a
reduction to shareholders' equity of approximately $747 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant. We were in compliance with all Credit Agreement
covenants and we had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2014.



We
had cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits of approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2014. Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest
bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts, money market mutual funds containing government
securities and treasury obligations. While we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the
security or availability of these investments.

Of
the $1.7 billion and the $1.5 billion of cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits we held at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
$672 million and $622 million, respectively, is held in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., their repatriation into the U.S. may result
in additional U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. The amount of such taxes is dependent on the income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution.

We
utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the European euro and the U.S. dollar; commodity cost fluctuations,
primarily zinc and copper; and interest rate fluctuations, primarily related to debt issuances. We review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis.

In
the second quarter of 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend to $.09 per common share from $.075 per common share.

Our
current ratio was 1.7 to 1 and 2.1 to 1 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in the current ratio was due to the short-term classification of
$500 million of 4.8% Notes due June 2015 at December 31, 2014.

Net
cash provided by operations of $602 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of
$167 million, a $406 million net decrease in deferred taxes and other non-cash items, including stock-based
compensation expense and amortization expense related to in-store displays. Our cash provided by operations was positively affected by increased sales and more effective accounts payable management.

Net
cash used for financing activities was $297 million, primarily due to $158 million for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock in open market transactions
(as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value, and includes 1.7 million shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in 2014),
$117 million for cash dividends paid and $34 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest.

In
September 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise,
replacing the previous Board of Directors authorization established in 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased and retired 5 million common shares for cash of
$119 million. At December 31, 2014, we had remaining authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to an additional 45 million shares of our common stock. We expect
to repurchase between $400 million and $500 million of our common stock in 2015.

We
believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment needs. We believe that our longer-term
working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities.
Consistent with past practice, we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2015 as part of our strategic initiative and to offset any dilution from long-term stock awards granted as part of our compensation
programs.

Net
cash used for investing activities was $100 million, and included $128 million for capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities included primarily
$63 million from the net sale of financial investments and $16 million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment. Investing activities also include net cash used for
the purchase of short-term bank deposits of $20 million.

We
continue to invest in our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity, improve customer service and support new product innovation, as well as to invest in our distribution
facilities. Capital expenditures for 2014 were $128 million, compared with $126 million for 2013 and $119 million for 2012. For 2015, capital expenditures, excluding any potential
2015 acquisitions, are expected to be approximately $190 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2014 totaled $167 million, compared with $186 million for 2013 and
$214 million for 2012, including accelerated depreciation of $1 million, $13 million and $28 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For 2015, depreciation and
amortization expense, excluding any potential 2015 acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $154 million. Amortization expense totaled $10 million, $11 million and
$12 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.



Costs
of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor do we expect them to have, a material effect on our capital
expenditures, financial position or results of operations.

Consolidated Results of Operations

We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP in the United States. However, we believe that certain non-GAAP performance
measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods.
Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results.

Sales and Operations

Net sales for 2014 were $8.5 billion, which increased four percent compared with 2013. The effect of currency translation and
acquisitions was insignificant compared with 2013. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions:

Net
sales for 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume of North American plumbing products, installation and other services, paints and stains, builders' hardware and
windows, which, in aggregate, increased sales by approximately three percent compared to 2013. Net sales for 2014 were also positively affected by selling prices for cabinets, international plumbing
products, installation and other services and windows, which in aggregate increased sales by approximately two percent. Net sales for 2014 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets
and by lower selling prices of paints and stains.

Net
sales for 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume of North American cabinets (such increase in cabinets was partially offset by a less favorable product mix),
installation and other services, plumbing products, paints and stains, builders' hardware and windows, which, in aggregate, increased sales by approximately seven percent compared to 2012. Net sales
of international plumbing products and cabinets also increased sales by one percent compared to 2012. Net sales for 2013 were also positively affected by selling prices, which increased sales by
approximately one percent. Net sales for 2013 were negatively affected by lower selling prices of paints and stains.

Net
sales for 2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume of installed products, North American plumbing products, paints and stains, builders' hardware and windows, and
selling price increases. Net sales for 2012 were negatively affected by the planned exit of certain cabinet and window product lines in certain geographic areas.

Our
gross profit margins were 28.0 percent, 27.6 percent and 26.1 percent in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 2014 and 2013 gross profit margin reflects a more
favorable relationship between
selling prices and commodity costs as well as increased sales volume. Both 2014 and 2013 reflect the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.



Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 18.9 percent in 2014 compared with 19.4 percent in 2013 and 20.5 percent in 2012. Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2014 and 2013 reflect increased sales. Both 2014 and 2013 also reflect the benefits associated with our business rationalizations and other
cost savings initiatives.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other, net, for 2014 included gains of $4 million from private equity funds and realized foreign currency gains of
$5 million and other miscellaneous items. Other, net, for 2014 included losses from equity investments, net, of $2 million.

Other,
net, for 2013 included income from equity investments, net of $16 million and gains of $11 million from private equity funds. Other, net, for 2013 also included
realized foreign currency losses of $18 million and other miscellaneous items.

In
2013, in conjunction with the transaction to sell our Danish ready-to-assemble cabinet business (included in discontinued operations), we also disposed of a related Danish holding
company. This disposition triggered the settlement of loans, which resulted in the recognition of $18 million of currency translation expense, which is included in other income (expense), net
from continuing operations in the statement of operations.

Other,
net, for 2012 included net gains of $24 million from private equity funds. During 2012, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges aggregating $2 million for
an investment in a private equity fund. Other, net, for 2012 also included realized foreign currency losses of $2 million and other miscellaneous items.

Interest
expense was $225 million in 2014, $235 million in 2013 and $254 million in 2012.

Income (Loss) and Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share from Continuing Operations (Attributable to Masco Corporation)

Income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2014 were $861 million and $2.39 per common share,
respectively. Income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2013 were $298 million and $.83 per
common share, respectively. (Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing operations for 2012 were $(53) million and $(.16) per common share, respectively. (Loss) from continuing
operations for 2012 included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other intangible assets of $42 million ($27 million or $.08 per common share, after tax).



Our effective tax rate on income (loss) from continuing operations was 58 percent tax benefit, 25 percent tax expense and 125 percent tax
expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Compared to our normalized tax rate of 36 percent, the variance in 2014 is primarily due to $529 million tax benefit related to the reversal
of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The variance from our normalized tax rate in 2013 and 2012 is due primarily to changes in the U.S. Federal valuation allowance and reversal of an
accrual for uncertain tax positions.

Outlook for the Company

We continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives, which include leveraging opportunities across our businesses, driving the
full potential of our core businesses and actively managing our portfolio. In 2015, we expect new home construction and repair and remodel activity to show continued improvement in North American and
internationally. Our focus will be to continue to maximize the benefits of this activity and maintain the positive momentum. We are well positioned to grow our key brands and to gain share in our
channels in 2015.

We
believe and are confident that the long-term fundamentals for new home construction and home improvement activity continue to be positive. We believe that our strong financial
position, together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands, including KRAFTMAID and MERILLAT cabinets, DELTA and HANSGROHE faucets, BEHR paint and MILGARD windows, our continued
focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles, will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.

Business Segment Results Discussion

Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general corporate
expense, net, income (charge) for litigation settlements, net, gain from sales of fixed assets, net and impairment charges for other intangible assets in 2014, 2013 and 2012, as applicable.

Business Rationalizations and Other Initiatives

Over the last several years, we have taken several actions focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including
business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions and other cost savings initiatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred net pre-tax costs and charges
related to these initiatives of $72 million (including $6 million of spin-off transaction costs), $48 million and $75 million, respectively.

We
continue to realize the benefits of our business rationalizations and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise and expect to identify additional opportunities to
improve our business operations. We do not anticipate that any costs and charges related to our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will be as significant as they have been.

During
2014, our North American cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of $31 million primarily related to actions taken to sell two previously idled manufacturing
facilities. Our corporate office incurred $27 million in costs primarily related to severance actions. Finally, we incurred $8 million of costs and charges across our business units
related to other cost savings initiatives.

On
September 30, 2014, we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our Installation and Other Services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company through a
tax-free stock distribution to our shareholders. The transaction is expected to be completed in mid-2015. Through December 31, 2014, we have incurred $6 million of costs and charges
related to this transaction. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Installation and Other Services businesses are included in continuing operations until the transaction is completed.

During
2013, our North American cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of $11 million related to the closure of a cabinet components facility and additional
severance. Our Plumbing Products segment incurred costs of $16 million related to a plant consolidation and severance in our bathing systems business in North America. Finally, we incurred
$21 million of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives.

During
2012, our North American cabinet business incurred costs and charges of $33 million related to the closure of its countertop manufacturing facility (as a result of our
strategic change to a sourcing model for countertops), the closure of a cabinet components facility and additional headcount reductions. Our Plumbing Products segment incurred costs of
$25 million related to a plant closure and severance in our bathing systems business in North America and a plant closure and severance in Spain. We also incurred $14 million in costs
related to severance actions at our corporate office. Finally, we incurred $3 million of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives.

Based
on current plans, we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate $30 million in 2015. Our business
rationalization expenses in 2015 include approximately $25 million of costs and charges related to the spin-off transaction. We continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional
rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges.



Cabinets and Related Products

Sales

Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products in 2014 decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix of
North American operations, which decreased sales by nine percent compared to 2013. Such decreases more than offset increased selling prices in North America and increased sales volume and a more
favorable product mix of international cabinets, which increased sales by seven percent compared to 2013.

Net
sales in this segment in 2013 increased primarily due to increased sales volume of North American and International operations and by increased selling prices in North America which,
in the aggregate, increased sales by 14 percent compared to 2012. Such increases were partially offset by a less favorable product mix in North America, which reduced sales in this segment by
six percent.

Net
sales in this segment in 2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume of North American operations and by increased selling prices.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Cabinets and Related Products segment in 2014 were negatively affected by lower North American sales volume
and the related under-absorption of fixed costs as well as increased business rationalization expenses. Operating margins were also negatively affected by a less favorable product mix. Such declines
more than offset a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with such expenses incurred in prior years.
Operating margins were also positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, as well as increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed
costs. Such increases were partially offset by a less favorable product mix.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2012 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with such expenses incurred in prior years.

Plumbing Products

Sales

Net sales of Plumbing Products increased in 2014 primarily due to increased sales volume of both North American and International
operations, which, in aggregate, increased sales by four percent compared to 2013. This segment was also positively affected by increased selling prices of International plumbing products.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2013 primarily due to increased sales volume and increased selling prices, which, in aggregate, increased sales by eight percent compared to 2012.
A weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by one percent in 2013 compared to 2012. Such increases were partially offset by the loss of a portion of our bath products business.

Net
sales in this segment in 2012 were positively affected by primarily increased sales volume of North American operations and increased selling prices. Lower sales volume of
international operations decreased sales in this segment.



Operating Results

Operating margins in the Plumbing Products segment in 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume, a more favorable
relationship between selling prices and commodity costs (including the impact of the metal hedge contracts), lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with business
rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs (including the
impact of the metal hedge contracts), partially offset by a less favorable product mix.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2012 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix principally related to International operations. Such declines
more than offset increased North American sales volume and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs.

Installation and Other Services

Sales

Net sales in the Installation and Other Services segment increased in 2014 primarily due to increased volume of distribution sales, as
well as increased sales volume related to a higher level of activity in the new home construction and commercial markets, which increased sales by six percent compared to 2013. Net sales were also
positively affected by increased selling prices.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2013 primarily due to increased sales volume related to a higher level of activity in the new home construction market, as well as increased
selling prices. Net sales were also positively affected by increased retrofit and commercial sales.

Net
sales in this segment in 2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume related to a higher level of activity in the new home construction market and increased commercial
sales.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Installation and Other Services segment in 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume and a more
favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed costs, as well as the benefits associated with business
rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating margins were also positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed costs, as well as the benefits associated with business
rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Decorative Architectural Products

Sales

Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased in 2014, primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and stains related
to new product introductions and other growth initiatives and increased sales volume of builders' hardware, partially offset by lower selling prices of paints and stains.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2013, primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders' hardware, partially offset by lower selling prices of paints and
stains.



Net
sales in this segment in 2012 were positively affected by increased selling prices of paints and stains, as well as increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders'
hardware.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Decorative Architectural Products segment in 2014 reflect a less favorable relationship between selling prices
and commodity costs, a less favorable product mix of paints and stains and costs for new product introductions and advertising. Such decreases more than offset the benefits associated with cost
savings initiatives.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 reflect the benefits of increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders' hardware. Such benefits were partially offset by a less
favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and increased promotional and advertising costs.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2012 reflect a more favorable product mix, a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs related to paints and stains and
lower program costs related to builders' hardware.

Other Specialty Products

Sales

Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased in 2014 primarily due to more favorable product mix, increased selling prices and
increased sales volume of North American windows in the Western U.S. which, in the aggregate, increased sales by eight percent compared to 2013. This segment was also positively affected by a more
favorable product mix and increased selling prices of our U.K. windows business, which increased sales in this segment by two percent compared to 2013. A weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by one
percent in 2014 compared to 2013. Such increases were partially offset by lower sales volume and lower selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.

Net
sales in this segment increased in 2013 primarily due to increased sales volume, increased selling prices and a more favorable product mix of windows in North America which, in the
aggregate, increased sales by 11 percent compared to 2012. Such increases were partially offset by lower sales volume and lower selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.

Net
sales in this segment in 2012 were affected by increased sales volume of windows in Western markets in the U.S., a more favorable product mix and increased selling prices which were
offset by lower sales volume of North American windows resulting from the exit of certain markets.

Operating Results

Operating margins in the Other Specialty Products segment in 2014 reflect a more favorable relationship between selling prices and
commodity costs, a more favorable product mix of U.S. and U.K. windows and increased sales volume in the western U.S. Such positive results were partially offset by lower sales volume and lower
selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.

Operating
margins in this segment in 2013 reflect increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed costs, as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and
commodity costs. This segment also reflects the benefits associated with the business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Such positive results were partially offset by lower sales
volume and lower selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools.

Operating
results in the Other Specialty Products segment in 2012 were positively affected by the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives,
lower business rationalization costs and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. These items more than offset the increased warranty expense of $12 million.



Geographic Area Results Discussion

North America

Sales

North American net sales in 2014 were positively impacted by increased sales volume of plumbing products, installation and other
services, paints and stains, builders' hardware and windows which, in the aggregate, increased sales by approximately four percent compared to 2013. Net sales were also positively affected by
increased selling prices of cabinets, installation and other services and windows, which increased sales by approximately two percent compared to 2013. Such increases were partially offset by lower
sales volume of cabinets and lower selling prices of paints and stains.

Other Matters

Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

Information regarding our legal proceedings is set forth in Note U to the consolidated financial statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Other Commitments

With respect to our investments in private equity funds, we had, at December 31, 2014, commitments to contribute up to
$9 million of additional capital to such funds, representing our aggregate capital commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. We are contractually obligated to make
additional capital contributions to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. We have no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital
calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our investment in the private equity fund when paid.

We
enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which we operate. Such indemnifications include claims made
against builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, we occasionally provide reasonable and customary
indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; and provisions for sales returns. We have never had to pay a material amount
related to these
indemnifications, and we evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and we appropriately record an estimated liability when probable.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard for revenue recognition, Accounting Standards
Codification 606 (ASC 606). The purpose of ASC 606 is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability across industries. ASC 606
is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017.



We
are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our results of operations.

In
April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-8 (ASU 2014-8), "Reporting of Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposals of Components of an Entity," which
changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies the related disclosure requirements. ASU 2014-8 is effective for us beginning
January 1, 2015. We do not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We have considered the provisions of accounting guidance regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial
instruments and derivative commodity instruments, and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments
and derivative commodity instruments.

We
are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity costs in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related
to our financial investments. We have involvement with derivative financial instruments and use such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and
commodity fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments.

At
December 31, 2014, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change
of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates, a 10 percent decline in the market value of our long-term investments, a 10 percent change in commodity costs, or a
10 percent change in interest rates. Based upon the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.



Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Masco Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Masco Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The
management of Masco Corporation assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 using the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in "Internal Control – Integrated Framework." Based on this assessment, management has determined that
the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, performed an audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of
Masco Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. Their report expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Masco Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 and expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's 2014 consolidated financial statements. This report appears under 'Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' under the heading "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm."



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Masco Corporation:

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Masco Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Masco Corporation and all majority-owned
subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. We consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of variable interest entities, for which we are the primary beneficiary.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates
and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are
rendered, net of
applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. We record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon material and labor incurred in the Installation and Other Services segment;
such amounts are recorded in receivables. Amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in net sales, while costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales.

Customer Promotion Costs.

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special
pricing and
co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. In-store displays that are owned by us and used to market our products are included in other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets and are amortized using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of three to five years; related amortization expense is classified as a selling expense in
the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Currency.

The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional
currency. Assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. The resulting
cumulative translation adjustments have been recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income component of shareholders' equity. Realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
included in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net.

Cash and Cash Investments.

We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash and
cash
investments.

Short-Term Bank Deposits.

We invest a portion of our foreign excess cash in short-term bank deposits. These highly liquid investments
have original
maturities between three and twelve months and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013. These short-term bank deposits are classified in the current
assets section of our consolidated balance sheets, and interest income related to short-term bank deposits is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Receivables.

We do significant business with a number of customers, including certain home centers and homebuilders. We monitor our
exposure for
credit losses on our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on-going basis and record related allowances for
doubtful accounts. Allowances are estimated based upon specific customer balances, where a risk of default has been identified, and also include a provision for non-customer specific defaults based
upon historical collection, return and write-off activity. During downturns in our markets, declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impacts the credit risk of the
receivables involved and we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults. A separate allowance is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally based upon sales
activity. Receivables are presented net of certain allowances (including allowances for doubtful accounts) of $48 million and $57 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Receivables include unbilled revenue related to the Installation and Other Services segment of $24 million at both December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment, including significant betterments to existing facilities, are recorded at cost. Upon
retirement or
disposal, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations. Maintenance and repair costs are charged
against earnings as incurred.

We
review our property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount
and the current fair value. Further, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the
remaining depreciation periods.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense is computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Annual
depreciation rates are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10 percent, and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation expense was $157 million,
$175 million and $192 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Such depreciation expense included accelerated depreciation of $1 million (in the Cabinets and Related Products
segment), $13 million (primarily in the Cabinets and Related Products and Plumbing Products segments) and $28 million (primarily in the Cabinets and Related Products and Plumbing
Products segment) in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

We perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or as
events occur or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of
goodwill at the operating segment level. Our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities, for which discrete financial information, including five-year forecasts, are
available. We compare the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Fair value is
determined using a discounted cash flow method, which includes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).

Determining
market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions
and



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

appropriate
discount rates. Our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. In estimating future
cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term assumed annual growth
rate of cash flows for periods after the five-year forecast. We utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to
the estimated future cash flows. Our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2014 due to lower bond rates. In 2014, based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses, we
applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 11.0 percent to 14.0 percent for our reporting units.

If
the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting
unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair value of a reporting
unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of goodwill.

We
review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may
be impaired without regard to the business unit. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal
(e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term.

Intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable
intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. See Note H for additional information
regarding Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Fair Value Accounting.

We follow accounting guidance for our financial investments and liabilities which defines fair value,
establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures about fair value measurements. We also follow this guidance for our non-financial investments and liabilities.

The
fair value of financial investments and liabilities is determined at each balance sheet date and future declines in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying
investments or new information could affect the recorded values of our investments in marketable securities, private equity funds and other private investments.

We
use derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity costs
and interest rate exposures. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value, netted by counterparty, where the
right of offset exists. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in determining current earnings during the period of the change in fair value.

Warranty.

At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products, parts or services to repair
or replace
products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. Our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the
warranty coverage, the warranty period, historical experience specific to the nature, frequency and average cost to service the claim, along with product manufacturing metrics and industry and
demographic trends.

Certain
factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors. We believe that
the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals.

A
majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return.
However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return
deduction from us. Our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale.

Insurance Reserves.

We provide for expenses associated with workers' compensation and product liability obligations when such amounts
are probable
and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change that would affect the estimated liability.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date.
Such expense is
recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 5 to 10 years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at age 65.

We
measure compensation expense for stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Such expense is recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock
options, typically five years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at age 65. We utilize the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
options.

Noncontrolling Interest.

We own 68 percent of Hansgrohe SE at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. The aggregate noncontrolling
interest,
net of dividends, at December 31, 2014 and 2013 has been recorded as a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheets.

Interest and Penalties on Uncertain Tax Positions.

We record interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions in income tax
expense.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation in the consolidated financial
statements. In
our consolidated statements of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately classified.

Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements.

During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, we identified an error
related to the
classification of our insurance reserves. We have revised previously reported balances on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 to correct for claims not expected to be settled
within the next year. Accrued liabilities decreased from the amounts previously reported by $96 million. Other liabilities increased from the amounts previously reported by $96 million.
This revision had no effect on our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows. This error is not considered material to any prior period financial statement.

During
the quarter ended March 31, 2014, we identified an error in the accounting for certain of our investments in private equity limited partnership funds. The investments were
inappropriately accounted for under the cost basis versus the equity method. The impact of the error was to under report the investment value (included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheets) and to over (under) state equity investment earnings (loss) (included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations). We have revised our December 31, 2013
and 2012 consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 in these financial statements to reflect the investment accounted for as an equity
investment. Retained earnings and other comprehensive income were adjusted for the changes in net income. This error is not considered material to any prior period financial statement.

This
revision has no net effect on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard for
revenue
recognition, Accounting Standards Codification 606 (ASC 606). The purpose of ASC 606 is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve
comparability across industries. ASC 606 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on
our results of operations.

In
April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-8 (ASU 2014-8), "Reporting of Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposals of Components of an Entity," which
changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies the related disclosure requirements. ASU 2014-8 is effective for us beginning
January 1, 2015. We do not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

B. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The presentation of discontinued operations includes components that we intend to sell, which comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from us.

On
September 30, 2014, we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our Installation and Other Services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company through a
tax-free stock distribution to our shareholders. The transaction is expected to be completed in mid-2015. Through December 31, 2014, we have incurred $6 million of costs and charges
related to this transaction. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Installation and Other Services businesses are included in continuing operations until the transaction is completed.

In
February 2013, we determined that Tvilum, our Danish ready-to-assemble cabinet business, was no longer core to our long-term growth strategy and, accordingly, we embarked on a plan
for disposition. In December 2013, we completed the disposition of this business and a related Danish holding company for net proceeds of $17 million.

Included
in (loss) gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net in 2014 are additional costs and charges related to the 2013 sale of Tvilum.

Included
in impairment of assets held for sale in 2013 is the impairment of fixed assets. During 2013, we estimated the fair value of the business held for sale, using unobservable
inputs (Level 3). After considering the currency translation gains reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, we recorded an impairment of $10 million in 2013.

In
2013, in conjunction with the transaction to sell Tvilum (included in discontinued operations), we also disposed of a non-operating entity in Denmark. This disposition triggered the
settlement of loans, which resulted in the recognition of $18 million of currency translation expense, which is included in other income (expense), net from continuing operations in the
consolidated statements of operations.

The
unusual relationship between income tax expense and loss before income tax in 2012 resulted primarily from the increase in the deferred tax liability associated with the abandonment
of tax basis in indefinite-lived intangibles due to the disposition of certain discontinued operations.

In
the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined that the estimated fair value calculated for Tvilum was lower than the net book value. We assessed the long-lived assets associated with this
business unit and determined that no impairment was necessary at December 31, 2012.

C. ACQUISITIONS

In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired a small U.K. door business in the Other Specialty Products segment. The total net cash purchase price was $4 million in 2013.

The
results of this acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective date of acquisition.

use of the first-in, first-out method.

E. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES

Accounting Policy.

We follow accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
prescribes disclosures
about fair value measurements for its financial investments and liabilities. The guidance defines fair value as "the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date." Further, it defines a fair value hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable
or can be corroborated by market data; and Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined
using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

Financial
investments that are available to be traded on readily accessible stock exchanges (domestic or foreign) are considered to have active markets and have been valued using
Level 1 inputs. Financial investments that are not available to be traded on a public market or have limited secondary markets, or contain provisions that limit the ability to sell the
investment are considered to have inactive markets and have been valued using Level 2 or 3 inputs. We incorporated credit risk into the valuations of financial investments by estimating the
likelihood of non-performance by the
counterparty to the applicable transactions. The estimate included the length of time relative to the contract, financial condition of the counterparty and current market conditions. The criteria for
determining if a market was active or inactive were based on the individual facts and circumstances.

Financial Investments.

We have maintained investments in available-for-sale securities, equity method investments, and a number of
private equity
funds and other private investments, principally as part of our tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future tax capital losses.

Auction Rate Securities.

Our investments in available-for-sale securities included cost basis of $19 million and pre-tax
unrealized gains of
$3 million and had a recorded basis of $22 million at both December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Equity Method Investments.

Investments in private equity fund partnerships, joint ventures and less than majority-owned subsidiaries in
which we have
significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Our consolidated statements of operations include our proportionate share of the net income or (loss) of our equity method investees.
When we record our proportionate share of net income (loss), it increases (decreases) our equity income in our consolidated statement of operations and our carrying value of that investment on our
consolidated balance sheet.

During
the fourth quarter of 2014, we sold our investment in the private equity fund, Long Point Capital Fund II L.P. (accounted for as an equity method investment) for proceeds
of $48 million, which approximated net book value. Such proceeds are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows in proceeds from other financial investments, in the investing
activities section.

Private Equity Funds and Other Investments.

Our investments in private equity funds and other private investments, where we do not have
significant
influence, are carried at cost. At December 31, 2014, we have investments in five venture capital funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $7 million. The venture capital funds invest
in start-up or smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors. At December 31, 2014, we also have investments in
12 buyout funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $7 million. The buyout funds invest in later-stage, established businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

For financial investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period, the
unrealized
gains or losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect, through shareholders' equity, as a component of other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and charges
for other-than-temporary
impairments are included in determining net income, with related purchase costs based upon specific identification.

In
the past, we invested excess cash in auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or 35 days.
The fair values of the auction



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

E. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES (Continued)

rate
securities held by us have been estimated, on a recurring basis, using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). The significant inputs in the discounted cash flow model used to value
the auction rate securities include: expected maturity of auction rate securities, discount rate used to determine the present value of expected cash flows and assumptions for credit defaults, since
the auction rate securities are backed by credit default swap agreements.

There
were no changes in the fair value of Level 3 financial investments for the year ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

It is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for equity method investments or private
equity funds
and other private investments, where we do not have significant influence, because there are no quoted market prices, and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation
model to determine the fair value for each fund. Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3 input. These investments are
evaluated, on a non-recurring basis, for potential other-than-temporary impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a
significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.

Impairment
indicators we consider include the following: whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a significant
adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment; a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates; industry and
sector performance; current equity and credit market conditions; and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value.

During
2014 and 2013, there were no financial investments measured on a non-recurring basis. During 2012, we recognized a $2 million loss related to private equity funds
(financial investments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis) using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

We
did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets in 2014 or 2013.

Realized Gains (Losses) and Impairment Charges.

estimates could change in the near-term based upon future events and circumstances.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

E. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES (Concluded)

The fair value of our short-term and long-term fixed-rate debt instruments is based principally upon modeled market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates available
to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. The aggregate estimated market value of short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2014 was approximately $3.7 billion,
compared with the aggregate carrying value of $3.4 billion. The aggregate estimated market value of short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2013 was approximately
$3.7 billion, compared with the aggregate carrying value of $3.4 billion.

F. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We are exposed to global market risk as part of our normal daily business activities. To manage these risks, we enter into various derivative contracts. These contracts include interest
rate swap agreements, foreign currency exchange contracts and contracts intended to hedge our exposure to copper and zinc. We review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk
management on a regular basis.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements.

In March 2012, in connection with the issuance of $400 million of debt, we terminated the interest
rate swap
hedge relationships that we had entered into in August 2011. These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and effectively fixed interest rates on the forecasted debt issuance to
variable rates based on 3-month LIBOR. Upon termination, the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges of approximately $2 million loss was recognized in our consolidated statement of
operations in other, net. The remaining loss of approximately $23 million from the termination of these swaps is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the remaining term of
the debt, through March 2022. At December 31, 2014, the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income was $18 million.

Foreign Currency Contracts.

Our net cash inflows and outflows exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arise
from the sale
of products in countries other than the manufacturing source, foreign currency denominated supplier payments, debt and other payables, and investments in subsidiaries. To mitigate this risk during
2014, 2013 and 2012, we, including certain European operations, entered into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts.

Gains
(losses) related to foreign currency forward and exchange contracts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net. In the event that the
counterparties fail to meet the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts, our exposure is limited to the aggregate foreign currency rate differential with such institutions.

Metals Contracts.

During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we entered into several contracts to manage our exposure to increases in the price of
copper and zinc.
Gains (losses) related to these contracts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in cost of sales.

We
lease operating facilities from certain related parties, primarily former owners (and in certain cases, current management personnel) of companies acquired. We recorded rental expense
to such related parties of approximately $5 million in 2014, $6 million in 2013 and $5 million in 2012.

comparable buildings in the areas where the facilities are located, Level 3 inputs.

As
a result of our business rationalization activities over the last several years, at December 31, 2014, we were holding several facilities for sale, primarily within the
Cabinets and Related Products segment. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the net book value of facilities held for sale was approximately $18 million and $17 million, respectively,
included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.

In
the fourth quarters of 2014, 2013 and 2012, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment test in 2014, 2013 and
2012 indicated there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units.

H. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Concluded)

Other indefinite-lived intangible assets were $131 million and $133 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and principally included registered
trademarks. In 2014, we recognized an insignificant impairment charge for other indefinite-lived intangible assets. In 2013, the impairment test indicated there was no impairment of other intangible
assets for any of our business units. In 2012, the impairment test indicated that the registered trademark for a North American business unit in the Other Specialty Products segment was impaired due
to changes in the long-term outlook for the business unit. We recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $42 million ($27 million,
after tax) in 2012.

The
carrying value of our definite-lived intangible assets was $14 million (net of accumulated amortization of $65 million) at December 31, 2014 and
$16 million (net of accumulated amortization of $62 million) at December 31, 2013 and principally included customer relationships and non-compete agreements, with a weighted
average amortization period of 6 years in both 2014 and 2013. Amortization expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets of continuing operations was $5 million in 2014,
$5 million in 2013 and $6 million in 2012.

At
December 31, 2014, amortization expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets during each of the next five years was as follows: 2015 –
$5 million; 2016 – $3 million; 2017 – $1 million; 2018 – $1 million and 2019 –
$1 million.

All
of the notes and debentures above are senior indebtedness and, other than the 6.625% notes due 2018 and the 7.75% notes due 2029, are redeemable at our option.

On
March 28, 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of
March 28, 2018.

The
Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to us and one of our foreign subsidiaries, in U.S. dollars, European euros and certain other
currencies. Borrowings under the revolver denominated in euros are limited to $500 million, equivalent. We can also borrow swingline loans up to $150 million and obtain letters of credit
of up to $250 million; any outstanding Letters of Credit, under the Credit Agreement, reduce our borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2014, we had $75 million of outstanding and
unused Letters of Credit, reducing our borrowing capacity by such amount.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

K. DEBT (Concluded)

Revolving credit loans bear interest under the Credit Agreement, at our option, at (A) a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal
Funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.0% (the "Alternative Base Rate"); plus an applicable margin based upon our then applicable corporate credit ratings; or (B) LIBOR
plus an applicable margin based upon our then applicable corporate credit ratings. The foreign currency revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based
upon our then applicable corporate credit ratings.

The
Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (A) a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio, as adjusted for certain items, of 65 percent,
and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, equal to or greater than 2.5 to 1.0. The debt to total capitalization ratio allows the add-back, if incurred, of up to
the first $250 million of certain non-cash charges, including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, occurring from and after January 1, 2012 that would negatively
impact shareholders' equity.

Based
on the limitations of the debt to total capitalization ratio covenant in the Credit Agreement, at December 31, 2014, we had additional borrowing capacity, subject to
availability, of up to $1.2 billion. Additionally, at December 31, 2014, we could absorb a reduction to shareholders' equity of approximately $747 million and remain in compliance
with the debt to total capitalization covenant.

In
order for us to borrow under the Credit Agreement, there must not be any default in our covenants in the new Credit Agreement (i.e., in addition to the two financial covenants,
principally limitations on subsidiary debt, negative pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and maintenance of properties and insurance) and our representations and warranties in the
Credit Agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change, since
December 31, 2012, in each case, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance and no material tax deficiency). At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we were in compliance with all
covenants and no borrowings have been made under the Credit Agreement.

At
December 31, 2014, the debt maturities during each of the next five years were as follows: 2015 – $505 million; 2016 –
$1,001 million; 2017 – $300 million; 2018 – $115 million and 2019 – $1 million.

Interest
paid was $220 million, $232 million and $269 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

L. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Our 2014 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") replaced the 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan in May 2014 and provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various
forms to employees and non-employee Directors of the Company. At December 31, 2014, outstanding stock-based incentives were in the form of long-term stock awards, stock options, phantom stock
awards and stock appreciation rights.

Pre-tax
compensation expense and the related income tax benefit for these stock-based incentives were as follows, in millions:

At
December 31, 2014, a total of 12.2 million shares of our common stock were available under the 2014 Plan for the granting of stock options and other long-term stock
incentive awards.

Long-Term Stock Awards.

Long-term stock awards are granted to our key employees and non-employee Directors and do not cause net share
dilution
inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares in the open market. We granted 1,729,800 shares of long-term stock awards during 2014.

Our
long-term stock award activity was as follows, shares in millions:

unvested stock awards; such awards had a weighted average remaining vesting period of three years for 2014 and 2013 and four years for 2012.

The
total market value (at the vesting date) of stock award shares which vested during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $50 million, $38 million and $27 million,
respectively.

Stock Options.

Stock options are granted to our key employees. The exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the
grant date.
These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date.

We
granted 332,750 of stock option shares during 2014 with a grant date exercise price approximating $22 per share. During 2014, 3.9 million stock option shares were forfeited
(including options that expired unexercised).

Phantom Stock Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs").

We grant phantom stock awards and SARs to certain non-U.S. employees.

Phantom
stock awards are linked to the value of our common stock on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon vesting, typically over 5 to 10 years. We account for phantom
stock awards as liability-based awards; the compensation expense is initially measured as the market price of our common stock at the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period. The
liability is remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the awards are fully-vested and paid to the employees. We recognized expense of $5 million, $5 million and
$7 million related to the valuation of phantom stock awards for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we granted 183,530 shares, 165,180 shares and 162,310 shares,
respectively, of phantom stock awards with an aggregate fair value of $4 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively, and paid $5 million, $4 million and
$3 million of cash in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, to settle phantom stock awards.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

L. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Concluded)

SARs are linked to the value of our common stock on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon exercise. We account for SARs using the fair value method, which requires outstanding
SARs to be classified as liability-based awards and valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date; such fair value is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period,
typically five years. The liability is remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the SARs are exercised and payment is made to the employees or the SARs expire. We recognized
expense of $1 million, $2 million and $4 million related to the valuation of SARs for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we did not grant any SARs.

M. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

We sponsor qualified defined-benefit and defined-contribution retirement plans for most of our employees. In addition to our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, we have unfunded
non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans covering certain employees, which provide for benefits in addition to those provided by the qualified pension plans. Substantially all salaried employees
participate in non-contributory defined-contribution retirement plans, to which payments are determined annually by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

In
addition, we participate in 21 regional multi-employer pension plans, principally related to building trades; none of the plans are considered significant.

For
our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, we have adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures
about fair
value measurements. Accounting guidance defines fair value as "the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date."

Following
is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2014.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

M. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)

Common and Preferred Stocks:

Valued at the closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, or based on
the active market for similar securities.

Private Equity and Hedge Funds:

Valued based on an estimated fair value using either a market approach or an income approach, each of
which requires a significant degree of judgment. There is no active trading market for these investments and they are for the most part illiquid. Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair
value measurements used to estimate fair value are a Level 3 input.

Corporate Debt Securities:

Valued based on the active market for similar securities or on estimated fair value.

Government and Other Debt Securities:

Valued based on either the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual
securities are traded, the market for similar securities or estimated fair value based on a model for similar securities.

Common Collective Trust Fund:

Valued based on a unit value basis, which approximates fair value as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.
Such basis is determined by reference to the respective fund's underlying assets, which are primarily marketable equity and fixed income securities. There are no unfunded commitments or other
restrictions associated with this fund.

Short-Term and Other Investments:

Valued based on a net asset value (NAV) which approximates fair value at December 31, 2014 and
2013. Such basis is determined by referencing the respective fund's underlying assets.

The
methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could
result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The
discount rate for obligations for 2014 and 2013 was based upon the expected duration of each defined-benefit pension plan's liabilities matched to the December 31, 2014 and
2013 Towers Watson Rate Link Curve. At December 31, 2014, such rates for our defined-benefit pension plans ranged from 2.00 percent to 4.00 percent, with the most significant
portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 3.70 percent or higher. At December 31, 2013, such rates for our defined-benefit pension plans ranged from
1.75 percent to 4.80 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 4.20 percent or higher. The decrease in the weighted
average discount rate over the last year is principally the result of lower long-term interest rates in the bond markets.

For
2014 and 2013, we determined the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25 percent based upon an analysis of expected and historical rates of return of various
asset classes utilizing the current and long-term target asset allocation of the plan assets. The projected asset return at both December 31, 2014 and 2013 also considered near term returns,
including current market conditions and also that pension assets are long-term in nature. The actual annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was 5.0 percent and 5.9 percent for
the 10-year periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Although these rates of return are less than our current expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we note that the
10-year period ended December 31, 2014 includes one significant decline in the equity markets. In 2014 and 2013, actual annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was 3.6 percent
and 13.6 percent, respectively. Accordingly, we believe a 7.25 percent expected long-term rate of return is reasonable.

The
investment objectives seek to minimize the volatility of the value of our plan assets relative to pension liabilities and to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits.
In 2014, we achieved targeted asset allocation: 46 percent equities, 34 percent fixed-income, and 20 percent alternative investments (such as private equity, commodities and hedge
funds). The asset allocation of the



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

M. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)

investment
portfolio was developed with the objective of achieving our expected rate of return and reducing volatility of asset returns, and considered the freezing of future benefits. The equity
portfolios are invested in individual securities or funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. The fixed-income portfolio is invested in corporate bonds, bond index
funds or U.S. Treasury securities. The increased allocation to fixed-income securities partially matches the bond-like and long-term nature of the pension liabilities. It is expected that the
alternative investments would have a higher rate of return than the targeted overall long-term return of 7.25 percent. However, these investments are subject to greater volatility, due to their
nature, than a portfolio of equities and fixed-income investments, and would be less liquid than financial instruments that trade on public markets. This portfolio is expected to yield a long-term
rate of return of 7.25 percent.

The
fair value of our plan assets is subject to risk including significant concentrations of risk in our plan assets related to equity, interest rate and operating risk. In order to
ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay benefits, a portion of plan assets is allocated to equity investments that are expected, over time, to earn higher returns with more volatility than
fixed-income investments which more closely match pension liabilities. Within equity, risk is mitigated by targeting a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization,
manager mandate size, investment style and process.

In
order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets are allocated to fixed-income investments that are exposed to interest rate risk. Rate
increases generally will result in a decline in fixed-income assets, while reducing the present value of the liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed income assets, partially
offsetting the related increase in the liabilities.

Potential
events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value include the risks of inadequate diversification and other operating risks. To mitigate these
risks, investments are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives. Policies and practices to address operating risks include ongoing manager oversight, plan and
asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers, and periodic compliance and audit reviews to ensure adherence to these policies. In addition, we periodically seek
the input of our independent advisor to ensure the investment policy is appropriate.

Other.

We sponsor certain post-retirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental and life insurance coverage for eligible retirees
and dependents
in the United States based upon age and length of service. The aggregate present value of the unfunded accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was $12 million and $10 million at
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Cash Flows.

At December 31, 2014, we expected to contribute approximately $40 million to our qualified defined-benefit pension
plans to
meet ERISA requirements in 2015. We also expected to pay benefits of $7 million and $12 million to participants of our foreign and non-qualified (domestic) defined-benefit pension plans,
respectively, in 2015.

N. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

On September 30, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in open-market
transactions or otherwise, replacing the previous Board of Directors authorization established in 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased and retired 5 million common shares for
cash of $119 million; we have 45 million shares remaining under the authorization.

In
addition, during 2014, we repurchased and retired 1.7 million shares of our common stock for cash aggregating $39 million, to offset the dilutive impact of the 2014
grant of 1.7 million shares of long-term stock awards. During 2013, we repurchased and retired 1.7 million shares of our common stock for cash aggregating $35 million, to offset
the dilutive impact of the 2013 grant of 1.7 million shares of long-term stock awards. During 2012, we repurchased and retired one million shares of our common stock, for cash aggregating
$8 million to offset the dilutive impact of the 2012 grant of one million shares of long-term stock awards.

On
the basis of amounts paid (declared), cash dividends per common share were $.33 ($.345) in 2014 and $.30 ($.30) in each of 2013 and 2012.

Q. SEVERANCE COSTS

As part of our continuing review of our operations, actions were taken during 2014, 2013 and 2012 to respond to market conditions. We recorded charges related to severance and early
retirement programs of $29 million, $20 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Such charges are principally reflected
in the consolidated statements of operations in selling, general and administrative expenses and were primarily paid when incurred.

At
December 31, 2014 and 2013, the net deferred tax (asset) liability consisted of net short-term deferred tax assets of $244 million and $73 million, respectively,
and net long-term deferred tax liabilities of $106 million and $397 million, respectively, and net long-term deferred tax assets included in other assets of $9 million and
$ – million, respectively.

The
current portion of the state and local income tax includes an $8 million, $8 million and $14 million tax benefit from the reversal of an accrual for uncertain
tax positions resulting primarily from the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and favorable settlements on state audits in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The deferred portion of the
state and local taxes includes a $(35) million, $13 million and $26 million tax (benefit) expense resulting from a change in the valuation allowance against state and



MASCO CORPORATION

S. INCOME TAXES (Continued)

local
deferred tax assets in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The deferred portion of the 2014 foreign taxes includes $(6) million tax benefit from a change in the valuation allowance against
foreign deferred tax assets.

The
accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Possible
sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that
generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.

If,
based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a
valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company's three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative
evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the company can place on projected taxable income to support the
recovery of the deferred tax assets.

In
the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a $372 million valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. In reaching
this conclusion, we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the U.S. housing market which led to U.S. operating losses and
significant U.S. goodwill impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative U.S. loss position.

During
2012 and 2011, objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as U.S. operating losses and significant impairment charges for U.S. goodwill in 2011 and other intangible assets,
continued to outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance. As a result, we recorded increases of $65 million and $87 million in the valuation allowance against
our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Although
new home construction activity and retail sales of builder products strengthened during 2013 resulting in profitability in our U.S. operations, we continued to record a full
valuation allowance against the U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as we remained in the three-year cumulative loss position throughout 2013.

In
the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal and certain state deferred tax assets due
primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our U.S. operations. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and
remodel activity in the U.S. and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our U.S. operations
over the past few years. Additionally, by the fourth quarter of 2014, we achieved a cumulative three-year income position in the U.S. due to eight consecutive quarters of U.S. pre-tax earnings
resulting in our anticipation of sufficient future taxable income to realize a significant portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets.

In
the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an additional $12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain U.K. and Mexican deferred tax assets
primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions.



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

S. INCOME TAXES (Continued)

We
continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize
our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made.

It
is reasonably possible that the continued improvements in certain of our businesses located in the U.S. could result in the objective positive evidence necessary to warrant the
additional reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance, up to approximately $27 million, by the end of 2015.

Of
the $238 million and $355 million deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2014 and December 31,
2013, $233 million and $345 million will expire between 2020 and 2032 and $5 million and $10 million are unlimited, respectively.

The
tax benefit from certain stock-based compensation is not recognized as a deferred tax asset until the tax deduction reduces cash taxes. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2014,
we have not recorded a $53 million deferred tax asset on additional net operating losses that, when realized, will be recorded to paid-in capital.

A
tax provision has not been provided at December 31, 2014 for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $12 million of undistributed
earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred tax liability on such earnings as the actual U.S.
tax would depend on income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution.

If
recognized, $26 million and $31 million of the liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, net of any U.S. Federal tax
benefit, would impact our effective tax rate.

Of
the $48 million and $59 million total liability for uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties, at December 31, 2014 and 2013,
$48 million and $65 million are recorded in other liabilities, $4 million and $ – million are recorded in liabilities for deferred income taxes and
$4 million and $6 million are recorded in other assets, respectively.

We
file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. We continue to participate in the Compliance Assurance Program ("CAP").
CAP is a real-time audit of the U.S. Federal income tax return that allows the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), working in conjunction with us, to determine tax return compliance with the U.S.
Federal tax law prior to filing the return. This program provides us with greater certainty about our tax liability for a given year within months, rather than years, of filing our annual tax return
and greatly reduces the need for recording a liability for U.S. Federal uncertain tax positions. The IRS has completed their examination of our consolidated U.S. Federal tax returns through 2013. With
few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state or foreign income tax examinations on filed returns for years before 2005.

As
a result of tax audit closings, settlements and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions within the next 12 months, we anticipate that it
is reasonably possible the liability for uncertain tax positions could be reduced by approximately $6 million.

We
follow accounting guidance regarding determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This accounting guidance clarifies that
share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends prior to vesting should be considered participating securities. We have granted restricted stock awards that
contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends on unvested shares; such unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities. As participating securities, the unvested shares are
required to be included in the calculation of our basic earnings per common share, using the "two-class method." The two-class method of computing earnings per common share is an allocation method
that calculates earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we allocated dividends and undistributed earnings (only in 2014 and 2013) to the unvested restricted stock awards (participating securities).

Additionally,
7 million common shares, 12 million common shares and 30 million common shares for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to stock options were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share due to their antidilutive effect.

Common
shares outstanding included on our balance sheet and for the calculation of earnings per common share do not include unvested stock awards (6 million common shares and
8 million common shares at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively); shares outstanding for legal requirements included all common shares that have voting rights (including unvested
stock awards).

Litigation.

We are subject to claims, charges, litigation and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including those
arising from
or related to contractual matters, intellectual property, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, product recalls, construction defect, insurance coverage, personnel and employment
disputes, anti-trust issues and other matters, including class actions. We believe we have adequate defenses in these matters and that the likelihood that the outcome of these matters would have a
material adverse effect on us is remote. However, there is no assurance that we will prevail in these matters, and we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements of claims or revise
our expectations regarding the outcome of these matters, which could materially impact our results of operations.

Investments.

With respect to our investments in private equity funds, we had, at December 31, 2014, commitments to contribute up
to
$9 million of additional capital to such funds representing our aggregate capital commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. We are contractually obligated to make
additional capital contributions to certain of our private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. We have no control over when or if the capital calls will occur.
Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our investment in the private equity fund when paid.

Other Matters.

We enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in
which we
operate. Such indemnifications include customer claims against builders for issues relating to our products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, we occasionally
provide reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset
valuations. We have never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications and we evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately record an estimated liability
when probable.
