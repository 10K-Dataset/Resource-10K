2010 Annual Report on

Form 10-K




PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Masco Corporation manufactures, distributes and installs home
    improvement and building products, with emphasis on brand-name
    consumer products and services holding leadership positions in
    their markets. We are among the largest manufacturers in North
    America of a number of home improvement and building products,
    including faucets, cabinets, architectural coatings and windows,
    and we are one of the largest installers of insulation for the
    new home construction market. We generally provide broad product
    offerings in a variety of styles and price points and distribute
    products through multiple channels, including directly to
    homebuilders and wholesale and retail channels. Approximately
    78 percent of our 2010 sales were generated by our North
    American operations.

We continue to experience a prolonged and substantial downturn
    in the home improvement and new home construction markets. As a
    result, during 2010, we continued to focus on the strategic
    rationalization of our businesses, including business
    consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system
    implementations and other cost savings initiatives. Since 2006,
    across our businesses, we have closed 23 manufacturing
    facilities; also, since 2006, we have closed approximately 100
    locations formerly operated by our Installation and Other
    Services segment. In 2010, we began the combination of our North
    American retail and builder cabinet businesses to
    form Masco Cabinetry. In 2010, we decided to discontinue
    the manufacture of

ready-to-assemble

and other non-core in-stock assembled cabinet product lines, as
    they were not consistent with Masco Cabinetry’s strategy of
    growth through brand building and innovation. In 2010, we also
    decided to close a cabinet manufacturing facility that had
    previously been idled.

We continue to focus on our cost structure and are driving
    process improvement through the implementation of the Masco
    Business System (“MBS”). The MBS is the integrated
    leadership practices, processes, tools and capabilities that
    enable the effective and consistent execution of our strategies
    and operating plans to maximize our full potential. Through the
    MBS, we are advancing our strategy of growing organic sales
    based on a better understanding of our customer needs and
    investing in new product innovation. We are also focusing on
    enhancing customer experience through improvements in product
    quality. In 2010, we introduced several new products, including
    the ESSENCE
    SERIES

tm

wood and fiberglass window by Milgard, the
    RED

®

line of staple guns and nail tackers and the
    ACE

®

Salt water sanitizing system. We are also continuing to invest
    in several initiatives launched in 2009, including programs
    related to BEHR PREMIUM PLUS
    ULTRA

®

interior paint, the
    DELTA

®

TOUCH


O

®

faucet, retro-fit home energy efficiency services and the sale
    of
    BEHR

and
    KILZ

®

branded products to professional painters.



We report our financial results in five business segments
    aggregated by similarity in products and services. The following
    table sets forth, for the three years ended December 31,
    2010, the contribution of our segments to net sales and
    operating (loss) profit. Additional financial information
    concerning our operations by segment and by geographic regions,
    as well as general corporate expense, net, as of and for the
    three years ended December 31, 2010, is set forth in
    Note O to our consolidated financial statements included in

Cabinets
    and Related Products

In North America, we manufacture and sell economy, stock and
    semi-custom assembled cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home
    office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of
    styles and price points. In Europe, we manufacture and sell
    assembled and

ready-to-assemble

kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home entertainment
    cabinetry. These products are sold in the United States and in
    Europe under a number of trademarks including
    KRAFTMAID

®

,

    DISTINCTIONS

®

,

    TVILUM-SCANBIRK

tm

and
    WOODGATE

®

primarily to dealers and home centers, and under the
    MERILLAT

®

,

    MOORES

tm

and QUALITY
    CABINETS

tm

brands primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the
    home improvement and new home construction markets. Cabinet
    sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both
    new home construction and retail consumer spending, particularly
    spending for major home improvement products. A significant
    portion of our sales for the home improvement market is made
    through home center retailers. We have also



expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the
    manufacture and sale of countertops in North America.

Over the past several years, the new home construction market
    has declined over 70 percent since the peak; this segment
    has been particularly affected by this downturn, as well as
    builders producing smaller homes with smaller kitchens. This
    segment has also been negatively affected by a downturn in the
    repair and remodel market, particularly by consumers deferring
    expenditures for big-ticket items.

In 2010, we began the combination of our Builder Cabinet Group
    and Retail Cabinet Group to form Masco Cabinetry. We
    believe that the creation of Masco Cabinetry will help us
    establish an even stronger position to lead the cabinet category
    within the repair and remodel and new home construction markets.
    Masco Cabinetry will offer a three brand portfolio of cabinets
    covering several price points addressing consumer preferences.
    Masco Cabinetry will also focus on growing the countertop
    business.

Over the past several years, we have closed several
    manufacturing plants in this segment. In 2010, we decided to
    discontinue the manufacture of

ready-to-assemble

and other non-core in-stock assembled cabinet product lines, as
    they were not consistent with Masco Cabinetry’s strategy of
    growth through brand building and innovation. This will result
    in the closure of two additional manufacturing facilities in the
    second quarter of 2011. In 2010, we also decided to close a
    manufacturing facility that had been previously idled.

We are currently focused on improving cabinet production
    efficiencies at lower volumes while maintaining our ability to
    respond effectively to increased demand when the home
    improvement and new home construction markets improve. We expect
    that by the end of the second quarter of 2011, we will be able
    to manufacture common cabinetry at most of our plants that
    principally manufacture cabinets for the new home construction
    market in North America.

The cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States and
    Europe is highly competitive, with several large competitors and
    numerous local and regional competitors. In addition to price,
    we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on
    product quality, responsiveness to customer needs, product
    features and selection. Our significant North American
    competitors include American Woodmark Corporation and Fortune
    Brands, Inc.

Plumbing
    Products

Our Plumbing Products segment sells a wide variety of faucet and
    showering devices that are manufactured by or for us. Our
    plumbing products are sold in North America and Europe under
    various brand names including
    DELTA

®

,

    PEERLESS

®

,

    HANSGROHE

®

,

    NEWPORT
    BRASS

®

,

    ALSONS

®

,

    SIRRUS

tm

and PLUMB
    SHOP

®

.

    Our products include single-handle and double-handle faucets,
    showerheads, handheld showers and valves, which are sold to
    major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors who,
    in turn, sell our products to plumbers, building contractors,
    remodelers, smaller retailers and others.

We believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in
    sales in the North American and European markets, with American
    Standard, Kohler, Moen and Price Pfister as major brand
    competitors. We also have several European competitors,
    primarily in Germany, including Friedrich Grohe. We face
    significant competition from private label products (including
    house brands sold by certain of our customers). Many of the
    faucet and showering products with which our products compete
    are manufactured in Asia. The businesses in our Plumbing
    Products segment source products from Asia and manufacture
    products in the United States, Europe and Asia.

Other plumbing products manufactured and sold by us include
    products branded as AQUA
    GLASS

®

,

    MIROLIN

®

and AMERICAN SHOWER &
    BATH

tm

acrylic and gelcoat tub and shower systems, bath and shower
    enclosure units, shower trays and laundry tubs, which are sold
    primarily to wholesale plumbing distributors and home center
    retailers for the North American home improvement and new home
    construction markets. Our spas are manufactured and sold under
    HOT
    SPRING

®

,

    CALDERA

®

and other trademarks directly to independent dealers. Major
    competitors include Kohler, Lasco, Maax and Jacuzzi. We sell



HÜPPE

®

shower enclosures through wholesale channels primarily in
    western Europe.
    HERITAGE

tm

ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally
    sold in the United Kingdom directly to selected retailers.

Also included in the Plumbing Products segment are brass and
    copper plumbing system components and other plumbing
    specialties, which are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware
    wholesalers and to home center retailers, hardware stores,
    building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These
    products are marketed in North America for the wholesale trade
    under the
    BRASSCRAFT

®

and BRASSTECH trademarks and for the “do-it-yourself”
    market under the MASTER
    PLUMBER

®

and PLUMB SHOP trademarks and are also sold under private label.

In addition to price, we believe that competition in our
    Plumbing Products markets is based largely on brand reputation,
    product quality, product innovation and features, and breadth of
    product offering.

A substantial portion of our plumbing products are made from
    brass, the major components of which are copper and zinc. We
    have encountered volatility in the price of brass. We have
    implemented a hedging strategy to attempt to minimize the impact
    of commodity price volatility. Legislation enacted in
    California, Vermont and Maryland mandates new standards for
    acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold in those
    states. Federal legislation mandating a national standard for
    lead content in plumbing products will become effective in
    January 2014. Faucet and water supply valve manufacturers,
    including our plumbing product companies, will be required to
    obtain adequate supplies of lead-free brass or suitable
    alternative materials for continued production of faucets and
    certain of our plumbing products.

In 2008, our Delta Faucet business introduced faucets
    incorporating its
    TOUCH


O
    technology and, in the future, Delta Faucet plans to expand the
    use of its capacitance sensing
    PROXIMITY

tm

technology in its product offerings. Also in 2008, our Delta
    Faucet business introduced a new water delivery system known as
    DIAMOND

tm

Seal Technology. DIAMOND Seal Technology reduces the number of
    potential leak points in a faucet, simplifies installation and
    satisfies the legislation described above regulating the
    acceptable lead content in plumbing products. Delta Faucet has
    continued to incorporate DIAMOND Seal Technology into most of
    its faucets. The success of DIAMOND Seal Technology depends on
    many factors, including the performance of the technology and
    the market’s acceptance of the technology as well as Delta
    Faucet’s ability to successfully integrate the technology
    into its most popular faucets.

Installation
    and Other Services

Our Installation and Other Services segment sells installed
    building products and distributes building products primarily to
    the new home construction market, and, to a lesser extent, the
    commercial construction and retro-fit markets, throughout the
    United States. In order to respond to the significant decrease
    in demand in the new home construction industry over the past
    several years, we have implemented various cost savings
    initiatives including the consolidation and closure of
    approximately 100 branch locations. This rationalization has
    been accomplished while maintaining our strategic presence in
    most of the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas
    (“MSA”) in the United States. In addition, we have
    de-emphasized the installation of certain non-insulation
    building products that are not core to our service offering,
    including windows and paint. In addition to insulation, we offer
    gutters, after-paint products, framing components, fireplaces,
    garage doors and cabinets. The installation and distribution of
    insulation comprised approximately eight percent, nine percent
    and eleven percent of our consolidated net sales for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Installed building products are supplied primarily to custom and
    production homebuilders by our network of branches located
    across the United States. Distributed products include
    insulation, insulation accessories, gutters, fireplaces and
    roofing. Distributed products are sold primarily to contractors
    and dealers (including lumber yards) from distribution centers
    in various parts of the United States.

Within this segment, we have launched several new initiatives
    related to improved energy efficiency, including energy audit
    and repair services and retrofit installation services delivered
    directly to homeowners as well as through retailers and dealer
    outlets.

In addition to price, we believe that competition in this
    industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of
    installation service. We believe that we are the largest
    national provider of installed insulation in



the new home construction industry in the United States. Our
    competitors include several regional contractors, as well as
    numerous local contractors and lumber yards. We believe that our
    financial resources are substantial compared to regional and
    local contractors.

Decorative
    Architectural Products

We produce architectural coatings including paints, primers,
    specialty paint products, stains and waterproofing products. The
    products are sold in the United States, Canada, China, Mexico
    and South America under the brand names
    BEHR

®

,

    KILZ

®

and
    EXPRESSIONS

®

to “do-it-yourself” and professional customers through
    home centers, paint stores and other retailers. Net sales of
    architectural coatings comprised approximately 20 percent,
    20 percent and 15 percent of our consolidated net
    sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Competitors in the architectural coatings market
    include large national and international brands such as Benjamin
    Moore, Glidden, Olympic, Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Zinsser,
    as well as many regional and other national brands. In addition
    to price, we believe that competition in this industry is based
    largely on product quality, technology and product innovation,
    customer service and brand reputation.

Our BEHR products are sold through The Home Depot, the
    segment’s and our largest customer. The paint departments
    at The Home Depot stores include the Behr color center and
    computer kiosk with the COLOR SMART BY
    BEHR

®

computerized color-matching system that enables consumers to
    select and coordinate their paint-color selection. In 2009,
    Behr’s product offering was enhanced by the introduction of
    the BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA interior paint, which is a
    high-quality, low volatile organic compound, interior paint and
    primer in one. The loss of this segment’s sales to The Home
    Depot would have a material adverse effect on this
    segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a
    whole.

Titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of
    paint. Shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium
    dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand
    and from production capacity limitations. Petroleum products are
    also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings.
    Significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas
    lead to higher raw material costs (e.g., for resins, solvents
    and packaging, as well as titanium dioxide), which can adversely
    affect the segment’s results of operations.

Our Decorative Architectural Products segment also includes
    LIBERTY

®

branded cabinet, door, window and other hardware, which is
    manufactured for us and sold to home centers, other retailers,
    original equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets. Key
    competitors in North America include Amerock, Top Knobs, Direct
    Import, Hickory Hardware and Stanley Black & Decker.
    Decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under
    the brand names FRANKLIN
    BRASS

®

and DECOR
    BATHWARE

®

to distributors, home centers and other retailers. Competitors
    include Moen and GATCO.

Other
    Specialty Products

We manufacture and sell vinyl, fiberglass and aluminum windows
    and patio doors under the
    MILGARD

®

brand name to the home improvement and new home construction
    markets, principally in the western United States. MILGARD
    products are sold primarily through dealers and, to a lesser
    extent, directly to production homebuilders and through lumber
    yards and home centers. In late 2010, Milgard introduced the
    ESSENCE SERIES of wood and fiberglass windows and doors,
    including the ESSENCE SERIES Wood Window, a window that
    combines a wood interior with a fiberglass exterior. This
    segment’s competitors in North America include national
    brands, such as Jeld-Wen, Simonton, Pella and Andersen, and
    numerous regional brands. In the United Kingdom, we manufacture
    and sell windows, related products and components under several
    brand names including
    GRIFFIN

tm

,

    CAMBRIAN

tm

,

    PREMIER

tm

and
    DURAFLEX

tm

.

    Sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the
    repair and remodeling markets, although our Duraflex business is
    also a supplier to other window fabricators. United Kingdom
    competitors include many small and mid-sized firms and a few
    large, vertically integrated competitors. In addition to price,
    we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on
    customer service and product quality.



We manufacture and sell a complete line of manual and electric
    staple gun tackers, staples and other fastening tools under the
    brand names
    ARROW

®

and
    POWERSHOT

®

.

    We sell these products through various distribution channels
    including home centers and other retailers and wholesalers. Our
    principal North American competitor in this product line is
    Stanley Black & Decker. In 2010, Arrow introduced a
    new product line of staple guns and nail tackers, which are
    Reliable, Ergonomic and Durable
    (RED

®

).

Additional
    Information

•

We hold United States and foreign patents, patent applications,
    licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary
    manufacturing processes. As a manufacturer and distributor of
    brand name products, we view our trademarks and other
    intellectual property rights as important, but do not believe
    that there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of such rights
    that would have a material adverse effect on our present
    business as a whole.

•

All of our operating segments, except the Plumbing Products
    segment, normally experience stronger sales during the second
    and third calendar quarters, corresponding with the peak season
    for new home construction and remodeling.

•

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. In addition to our
    responsibilities for environmental remediation, our businesses
    are subject to other requirements regarding protection of the
    environment and worker health and safety. Our businesses are
    subject to requirements relating to the emission of volatile
    organic compounds which may impact our sourcing of
    particleboard, require that we install special equipment in
    manufacturing facilities or that we reformulate paint products.
    As described above, our Plumbing Products segment is subject to
    restrictions on lead content in some of its products. Compliance
    with such laws and regulations could significantly affect
    product performance as well as our production costs. We monitor
    applicable laws and regulations relating to the protection of
    the environment, climate disruption and worker health and
    safety, and incur ongoing expense relating to compliance. We do
    not expect compliance with the federal, state and local
    regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the
    environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
    environment and worker health and safety, will result in
    material capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect
    on our earnings or competitive position.

•

We do not consider backlog orders to be material.

•

At December 31, 2010, we employed approximately
    32,500 people. Satisfactory relations have generally
    prevailed between us and our employees.

Item 1A. Risk
    Factors.

There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that
    could affect our business. These risks and uncertainties could
    cause our actual results to differ from past performance or
    expected results. We consider the following risks and
    uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business
    activities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently
    known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also
    may adversely impact our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.



A
    significant portion of our business relies on home improvement
    and new home construction activity levels, both of which are
    experiencing a prolonged and substantial downturn.

A significant portion of our business relies on home improvement
    (including repair and remodeling) and new home construction
    activity levels, principally in North America and Europe. The
    new home construction market, which is cyclical in nature, is
    experiencing a prolonged and substantial downturn marked by
    continued softness in the demand for new homes, an oversupply of
    new and existing homes on the market and more stringent
    standards for homebuyers seeking financing. The oversupply of
    existing homes held for sale is exacerbated by a growing number
    of home mortgage foreclosures as well as uncertainties in the
    home foreclosure process, which are contributing to the downward
    pressure on home prices.

Unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction,
    this economic decline is also adversely affecting our home
    improvement businesses. Continued low levels of consumer
    confidence, high levels of unemployment and the downward
    pressure on home prices have made consumers increasingly
    reluctant to make additional investments in existing homes, such
    as kitchen and bath remodeling projects. The increasing number
    of households with negative equity in their homes and more
    conservative lending practices, including for home equity loans
    which are often used to finance repairs and remodeling, are
    limiting the ability of consumers to finance home improvements.

Although we believe that the long-term outlook for the home
    improvement and new home construction markets is favorable, we
    cannot predict the type, timing or strength of a recovery in our
    markets. Prolonged depressed activity levels in consumer
    spending for home improvements and new home construction will
    continue to adversely affect our results of operations and our
    financial position and may disproportionately affect certain of
    our business segments that are most heavily dependent on new
    home construction markets and large consumer investments in home
    remodeling projects.

A
    prolonged economic downturn may reduce our financial resources
    and flexibility.

Our credit agreement contains various financial covenants we
    must comply with, including covenants regarding debt to total
    capitalization. At December 31, 2010, we had additional
    borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to
    $113 million; alternatively, we could absorb a reduction in
    shareholders’ equity of $61 million and remain in
    compliance with this covenant.

We have recently amended our credit agreement to allow for the
    add-back to shareholders’ equity of the impairment charges
    we took in 2010 for financial investments, goodwill and other
    intangible assets and changes to the valuation allowance on our
    deferred tax assets included in income tax expense aggregating
    $986 million, after tax. The amendment (deemed to be
    effective and applicable as of December 31, 2010) also
    allows us to add-back, if incurred, up to $350 million, in
    the aggregate, of future non-cash charges. We currently have
    borrowing capacity approximating $1 billion available under
    the Credit Agreement. See Footnote K for a detailed discussion
    of the terms of our credit facility and the recent amendment.

The valuation of assets on our balance sheet, particularly
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, is
    largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance
    of our businesses. A further decline in the expectation of our
    future performance, or a further deterioration in expectations
    regarding the timing and the extent of the recovery of the new
    home construction market, may cause us to recognize additional
    non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges, which are not determinable
    at this time, for certain long-lived assets, including goodwill.
    This could result in additional impairment charges for goodwill
    and other indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived
    assets and a further reduction in shareholders’ equity.
    Such charges and potential reduction in shareholders’
    equity may limit our borrowing capacity under our credit
    agreement. There can be no assurance that we would be able to
    further amend the credit agreement or to obtain alternative
    financing, that any such financing would be on acceptable terms
    or that we would be permitted to do so under the terms of our
    existing financing arrangements.



The
    volatile and challenging economic conditions of the past two
    years have caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing
    practices.

The volatile and challenging economic environment of the past
    two years has caused shifts in consumer preferences and
    purchasing practices and changes in the business models and
    strategies of our customers. Such shifts, which may or may not
    be long-term, have altered the type and prices of products
    demanded by the end-consumer and our customers. Over the past
    two years, we have seen a downward trend in the size of the new
    homes being built, resulting in smaller kitchens and baths. In
    addition, consumers have shown an increasing interest in
    lower-cost products. If we do not timely and effectively
    identify and respond to these changing consumer preferences, our
    relationships with our customers could be harmed, the demand for
    our products could be reduced and our market share could be
    negatively affected.

Our
    response to the prolonged downturn has been to continue our
    focus on implementation of cost savings initiatives, which have
    been costly and may not be effective.

During the current downturn in the home improvement and new home
    construction markets, we have focused on cost saving
    initiatives, including rationalizing our businesses through
    business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions,
    system implementations and other cost saving initiatives. During
    2010 and 2009, we incurred pre-tax costs and charges of
    $208 million and $94 million, respectively, related to
    these initiatives. In the future, we may incur costs and charges
    relating to additional cost savings initiatives.

We may not fully achieve the anticipated cost savings from these
    initiatives. If we do not effectively balance our focus on cost
    savings with the need to maintain a strong sales presence for
    our brands, we could lose market share. If the eventual recovery
    of our markets is fast-paced and robust, we may not be able to
    replace our reduced manufacturing and installation capacity in a
    timely fashion and our ability to respond to increased demand
    could be limited.

We rely
    on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between
    our distribution channels.

The size and importance of individual customers to our
    businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution
    channels have consolidated or exited the business. Larger
    customers can make significant changes in their volume of
    purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we
    receive for our products and services, our costs of doing
    business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do
    business. Sales of our home improvement and building products to
    home centers are substantial. In 2010, sales to our largest
    customer, The Home Depot, were $2.0 billion (approximately
    26 percent of our consolidated net sales). Lowe’s is
    our second largest customer. In 2010, our sales to Lowe’s
    were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales.
    Although homebuilders, dealers and other retailers represent
    other channels of distribution for our products and services,
    the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to The Home Depot
    or the loss of our sales to Lowe’s would have a material
    adverse effect on our business.

As some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted
    customers, conflicts between our existing distribution channels
    have and will continue to occur. In addition, we may undermine
    the business relationships we have with customers who purchase
    our products through traditional wholesale channels as we
    increase the amount of business we transact directly with our
    larger customers. In addition, our large retail customers are
    increasingly requesting product exclusivity, which may affect
    our ability to offer products to other customers.

Our
    principal markets are highly competitive.

The major geographic markets for our products and services are
    highly competitive and, in recent years, competition has
    intensified significantly. Competition is further intensified
    during economic downturns. Home centers are increasing their
    purchases of products directly from low-cost overseas suppliers
    for sale as private label and house brand merchandise.
    Additionally, home centers, which have historically concentrated
    their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers, are
    increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly



toward professional contractors and installers. We believe that
    competition in our industries is based on price, product and
    service quality, brand reputation, customer service and product
    features and innovation.

In addition to the challenges we have faced as a result of the
    economic downturn, our ability to maintain our competitive
    positions in our markets and to grow our businesses depends to a
    large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships
    with major customers, implementing growth strategies in our
    existing markets and entering new geographic markets,
    capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names, managing our
    cost structure, accommodating shorter life-cycles for our
    products and product development and innovation.

The cost
    and availability of materials and the performance of our supply
    chain affect our operating results.

It has been, and likely will continue to be, difficult for us to
    pass on to customers cost increases for commodities or other
    materials that are major components of our products or services.
    In addition, we may incur substantial costs as part of our
    strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain
    commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase
    supplies at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices.
    Delays in adjusting, or in our inability to adjust, selling
    prices may be due to factors such as our existing arrangements
    with customers, competitive considerations and customer
    resistance to price increases. Further, when commodity prices
    decline, we receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices
    for our products and services. Changes in energy costs and
    certain commodities not only impact our production costs, but
    also the cost to transport our products.

We manufacture products in Asia and source products and
    components from third parties in Asia. The distances involved in
    these arrangements, together with differences in business
    practices, shipping and delivery requirements, the limited
    number of suppliers, and laws and regulations, have increased
    the difficulty of managing our supply chain, the complexity of
    our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions
    in our production scheduling.

We rely heavily or, in certain cases, exclusively on outside
    suppliers for certain of our products or key components.
    Generally, these products and components are obtainable from
    various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, the loss
    of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or
    components from our suppliers, or the loss of key supplier
    arrangements may disrupt our business and could adversely impact
    our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

International
    political, monetary, economic and social developments affect our
    business.

Over 20 percent of our sales are made outside of North
    America (principally in Europe) and are transacted in currencies
    other than U.S. dollars (principally the euro and the
    British pound sterling). Increased international sales make up
    an important part of our future strategic plans. In addition, we
    manufacture products in Asia and source products and components
    from third parties in Asia. Our international business faces
    risks associated with changes in political, monetary, economic
    and social environments, labor conditions and practices, the
    laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, cultural
    differences and differences in enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights. U.S. laws affecting
    activities of U.S. companies doing business abroad,
    including tax laws and laws regulating various business
    practices, also impact our international business. Our
    international operating results may be influenced, when compared
    to our North American results, in part due to relative economic
    conditions in the European markets and due to competitive
    pricing pressures on certain products. The financial reporting
    of our consolidated operating results is affected by
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may present
    challenges in comparing operating performance from period to
    period and in forecasting future performance.



We have
    financial commitments and investments in financial assets,
    including assets that are not readily marketable and involve
    financial risk.

We continue to reduce our investment in private equity funds.
    Since there is no active trading market for investments in
    private equity funds, they are for the most part illiquid. These
    investments, by their nature, can also have a relatively higher
    degree of business risk, including financial leverage, than
    other financial investments. Future changes in market
    conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments
    or new information provided by private equity fund managers
    could affect the recorded values of such investments or the
    amounts realized upon liquidation. In addition, we have
    commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to
    these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from
    the private equity fund.

Claims
    and litigation could be costly.

We are, from time to time, involved in various claims,
    litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the
    ordinary course of our business and which could have a material
    adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract
    disputes, automobile liability and other personal injury claims,
    warranty disputes, environmental claims or proceedings, other
    tort claims, employment and tax matters and other proceedings
    and litigation, including class actions.

We are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and direct
    claims for product liability that can result in significant
    liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly
    to defend or manage. Also, we increasingly rely on other
    manufacturers to provide us with products or components for
    products that we sell. Due to the difficulty of controlling the
    quality of products or components sourced from other
    manufacturers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality
    of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such
    suppliers.

We have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years
    predicated upon claims for antitrust violations, product
    liability and wage and hour issues. We have generally denied
    liability and have vigorously defended these cases. Due to their
    scope and complexity, however, these lawsuits are particularly
    costly to resolve and significant exposures have been alleged.

Increasingly, our homebuilder customers are subject to
    construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary
    course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with
    these customers may include our agreement to defend and
    indemnify them against various liabilities caused by our
    negligence. These claims, often asserted several years after
    completion of construction, can result in complex lawsuits or
    claims against the homebuilders and many of their
    subcontractors, including us, and may require us to incur
    defense and indemnity costs even when our products or services
    are not the principal basis for the claims.

Although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters
    vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims
    and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or
    effect of any claim or litigation matter.

We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks
    of loss resulting from claims and litigation. We may elect not
    to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available
    insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The
    levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully
    cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant
    accident, judgment, claim or other event is not fully insured or
    indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

See Note S to the consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 of this Report for additional
    information about litigation involving our businesses.

Government
    and industry responses to environmental and health and safety
    concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating
    results.

We are subject to U.S. and foreign government regulations
    pertaining to health and safety (including protection of
    employees and consumers), climate disruption and environmental
    issues. In addition to



complying with current requirements and requirements that will
    become effective at a future date, even more stringent
    requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future.
    Compliance with these regulations may require us to alter our
    manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing. Such
    actions could adversely impact our operating results, and our
    ability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could
    adversely impact our competitive position.

The
    long-term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to
    attract, develop and retain talented personnel.

To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain highly
    qualified and talented personnel and, as we consider entering
    new international markets, skilled personnel familiar with these
    markets. We compete for employees with a broad range of
    employers in many different industries, including large
    multinational firms, and we invest significant resources in
    recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The
    failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees
    could negatively affect our competitive position and our
    operating results.

    and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be
    read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
    and related notes.

The following discussion and certain other sections of this
    Report contain statements reflecting our views about our future
    performance and constitute “forward-looking
    statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
    Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by
    words such as “anticipate,” “intend,”
    “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “assume,” “seek,”
    “appear,” “may,” “should”,
    “will” and similar references to future periods. These
    views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to
    predict and, accordingly, our actual results may differ
    materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking
    statements. We caution you against relying on any of these
    forward-looking statements. In addition to the various factors
    included in the “Executive Level Overview,”
    “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and
    “Outlook for the Company” sections, our future
    performance may be affected by our reliance on new home
    construction and home improvement levels, our reliance on key
    customers, the cost and availability of raw materials, shifts in
    consumer preferences and purchasing practices, and our ability
    to achieve cost savings through the Masco Business System and
    other initiatives. These and other factors are discussed in
    detail in Item 1A “Risk “Factors” of this
    Report. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Report
    speaks only as of the date on which it was made. Factors or
    events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge
    from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all
    of them. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
    forward-looking statements as a result of new information,
    future events or otherwise.

Executive
    Level Overview

We manufacture, distribute and install home improvement and
    building products. These products are sold to the home
    improvement and new home construction markets through mass
    merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, homebuilders,
    distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors.

During 2010, we continued to experience further sales volume
    declines for our cabinets, Installation and Other Services and
    builders’ hardware products. The sales volume decline for
    our installation and other services is primarily related to
    reduced revenue per job and the loss of market share in the new
    home construction market. The sales volume decline for our
    cabinet products is related to lower repair and remodel activity
    and shifting consumer preference to lower price point products,
    which has resulted in loss of market share related to cabinet
    repair and remodel activity with big box customers. Such sales
    volume declines were partially offset by a more favorable
    product mix of plumbing products and paints and stains. Net
    sales decreased three percent in 2010 from 2009, and operating
    profit (as adjusted to exclude impairment charges for goodwill
    and other intangible assets, general corporate expense, net,
    charge for defined-benefit plan curtailment, charge for
    litigation settlements, accelerated stock compensation expense,
    and loss on corporate fixed assets, net — see
    Footnote O of the consolidated financial statements)
    declined to 4.4 percent of sales in 2010
    from 6.2 percent of sales in 2009.

Factors that affect our results of operations include the levels
    of home improvement activity and new home construction
    principally in North America and Europe, the importance of our
    relationships with key customers (including The Home Depot,
    which represented approximately 26 percent of net sales in
    2010), our ability to maintain our leadership positions in our
    U.S. and global markets in the face of increasing
    competition and our ability to effectively manage our overall
    cost structure, including the cost and availability of
    materials. Our International businesses face political,
    monetary, economic and other risks that vary from country to
    country, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
    Further, we have financial commitments and investments in
    financial assets that are not readily marketable and that
    involve financial risk. In addition, litigation could be costly.
    These and other factors are discussed in more detail in
    Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Report.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date
    of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review
    our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical
    experience, as well as current economic conditions and various
    other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies are
    affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition and Receivables

We recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is
    transferred to customers or when services are rendered. We
    record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon
    estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other
    Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables. We
    record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and
    incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative
    advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based
    incentives. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts
    receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
    customers to make required payments. In addition, we monitor our
    customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our
    customers on an on-going basis. During downturns in our markets,
    declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of
    customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and
    we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer
    defaults. Our bad debt expense was $19 million,
    $34 million and $41 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In North America, we manufacture products (principally windows,
    doors and cabinets) and provide installation of insulation and
    other products and services to homebuilders. Our bad debt
    expense related to homebuilders was $10 million,
    $22 million and $28 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Inventories

We record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value, with expense estimates made for obsolescence or
    unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the
    recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value
    based upon assumptions about future demand and market
    conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor these estimates and
    record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual
    experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly
    deviated from those determined using these estimates.

Financial
    Investments

On January 1, 2008, we adopted accounting guidance that
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for
    our financial investments and liabilities. This guidance defines
    fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date.”
    Further, it defines a fair value hierarchy, as follows:
    Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs as
    observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted
    market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs
    that are observable or can be corroborated by market data; and
    Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by
    little or no market activity and that are financial instruments
    whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments
    for which the determination of fair value requires significant
    management judgment or estimation.



We have maintained investments in

available-for-sale

securities and a number of private equity funds, which
    aggregated $62 million and $106 million, respectively,
    at December 31, 2010. We record investments in

available-for-sale

securities at fair value, and unrealized gains or losses (that
    are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect,
    through shareholders’ equity, as a component of other
    comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet. We
    estimated the fair value of investments in

available-for-sale

securities using primarily Level 1 inputs.

In the past, we have invested excess cash in auction rate
    securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities
    that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or
    35 days. At December 31, 2010, our investment in
    auction rate securities was $22 million; we have not
    increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007.
    The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated, on a
    recurring basis, using a discounted cash flow model
    (Level 3 input). If we changed the discount rate used in
    the fair value estimate by 75 basis points, the value of
    the auction rate securities would change by approximately
    $1 million.

We carry our investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments at cost. It is not practicable for us to
    estimate a fair value for private equity funds and other private
    investments because there are no quoted market prices, and
    sufficient information is not readily available for us to
    utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each
    fund. These investments are evaluated, on a non-recurring basis,
    for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an
    event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.
    Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value
    measurements used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3
    input.

Impairment indicators we consider include the following: whether
    there has been a significant deterioration in earnings
    performance, asset quality or business prospects; a significant
    adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological
    environment; a significant adverse change in the general market
    condition or geographic area in which the investment operates;
    industry and sector performance; current equity and credit
    market conditions; and any bona fide offers to purchase the
    investment for less than the carrying value. We also consider
    specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of
    and business outlook for the fund, including industry and sector
    performance. The significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a
    fund for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment include current economic conditions, market analysis
    for specific funds and performance indicators in residential and
    commercial construction, bio-technology, health care and
    information technology sectors in which the applicable
    funds’ investments operate.

At December 31, 2010, we have investments in 17 venture
    capital funds, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $22 million. The venture capital funds invest in

start-up

or
    smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the
    information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors.
    At December 31, 2010, we also have investments in 26 buyout
    funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $84 million. The
    buyout funds invest in later-stage, established businesses and
    no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector.

Since there is no active trading market for these investments,
    they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their
    nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business
    risk, including financial leverage, than other financial
    investments. The timing of distributions from the funds, which
    depends on particular events related to the underlying
    investments, as well as the funds’ schedules for making
    distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to
    predict. As a result, the amount of income we record from these
    investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter.
    Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of
    the underlying investments or new information provided by
    private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of
    these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation.

We record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment
    has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be

other-than-temporary.

During 2010, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
    of $34 million related to our investment in Asahi Tec
    ($28 million), three private equity funds ($4 million)
    and one private investment ($2 million).



Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net
    tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other
    identifiable intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of each
    year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more
    likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
    its carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of
    goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. We selected
    the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it
    is comparable to what would be used by other market
    participants. We have defined our reporting units and completed
    the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment
    level, as defined by accounting guidance. Our operating segments
    are reporting units that engage in business activities, for
    which discrete financial information, including five-year
    forecasts, are available.

Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method
    requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions,
    including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions
    and appropriate discount rates. Our judgments are based upon
    historical experience, current market trends, consultations with
    external valuation specialists and other information. While we
    believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the
    valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and
    assumptions could result in different outcomes. In estimating
    future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year
    forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital
    expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term
    assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the
    five-year forecast. We generally develop these forecasts based
    upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing
    products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated
    housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing
    homes.

In 2010, for our reporting units that primarily sell to the new
    home construction market (including those in the Installation
    and Other Services segment), we utilized estimated housing
    starts, from independent industry sources, growing from current
    levels to 1.5 million units in 2015 (terminal growth year)
    and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical
    margins for those business units by 2015 (terminal growth year).
    We generally utilize our weighted average cost of capital
    (discount rate) of approximately eight percent to discount the
    estimated cash flows. However, in 2010, due to market
    conditions, we increased the discount rate to a range of nine
    percent to eleven percent for most of our reporting units, based
    upon a review of the current risks impacting our businesses.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we estimated that future
    discounted cash flows projected for most of our reporting units
    were greater than the carrying values. Any increases in
    estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the
    reported value of goodwill.

If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an
    allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit
    to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting
    unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets
    (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair value of a reporting
    unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is
    the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is
    recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s recorded
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

In 2010, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for
    goodwill aggregating $711 million ($587 million, after
    tax). The pre-tax impairment charge relates to our North
    American Installation business and reflects the weak level of
    new home construction activity in 2010, the historic low levels
    of new housing starts and the expectation that the recovery in
    the new home construction market will be modestly slower than
    previously anticipated. We increased the discount rate used to
    estimate the fair value of our businesses in the new home
    construction industry, due to the uncertainty regarding the
    timing and trajectory of the recovery in the new home
    construction market. These changes resulted in our book value
    exceeding the estimated fair value of the business, resulting in
    the impairment charge for goodwill.

A 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our
    reporting units at December 31, 2010 would not have
    resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for
    any additional business unit.



We review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events occur
    or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired
    without regard to the reporting unit. We consider the
    implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition
    and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales
    and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact
    on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the
    near-and long-term. In 2010, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax
    impairment charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    of $10 million ($6 million, after tax). The pre-tax
    impairment charges recorded in 2010 were as follows: Plumbing
    Products segment — $1 million, and Installation
    and Other Services segment — $9 million.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using
    the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We
    evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable
    intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether
    events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining
    periods of amortization.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Our 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005
    Plan”) provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives
    in various forms to employees and non-employee Directors. At
    December 31, 2010, outstanding stock-based incentives were
    in the form of long-term stock awards, stock options, phantom
    stock awards and stock appreciation rights.

Long-Term
    Stock Awards

We grant long-term stock awards to key employees and
    non-employee Directors and do not cause net share dilution
    inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and
    retiring an equal number of shares on the open market. We
    measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market
    price of our common stock at the grant date. There was
    $127 million (ten million common shares) of total
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock
    awards at December 31, 2010, which was included as a
    reduction of common stock and paid-in capital. Effective
    January 1, 2010, the vesting period for stock awards
    awarded after January 1, 2010 is 5 years. Effective
    January 1, 2006, we recognize this expense ratably over the
    shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 5
    to 10 years (except for stock awards held by grantees
    age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or the length
    of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. For stock awards granted prior to January 1,
    2006, we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the
    stock awards, typically 5 to 10 years, or for executive
    grantees that are, or will become, retirement-eligible during
    the vesting period, we recognize the expense over five years or
    immediately upon a grantee’s retirement. Pre-tax
    compensation expense for the annual vesting of long-term stock
    awards was $37 million for 2010.

Stock
    Options

We grant stock options to key employees. The exercise price
    equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date.
    These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over
    five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
    grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant
    date.

We measure compensation expense for stock options using a
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006, we recognize this
    compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting
    period of the stock options, typically five years, or the length
    of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006,
    we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the vesting
    period of the stock options, typically five years. Pre-tax
    compensation expense for stock options was $22 million for
    2010.

We estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    assumptions for 2010: risk-free interest rate — 2.76%,
    dividend yield — 2.17%, volatility



factor — 46.03% and expected option life —
    6 years. For expense calculation purposes, the weighted
    average grant-date fair value of option shares granted in 2010
    was $5.30 per option share.

If we increased our assumptions for the risk-free interest rate
    and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense
    related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2010 would
    increase by 43 percent. If we lowered our assumptions for
    the risk-free interest rate and the volatility factor by
    50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock
    options granted in 2010 would decrease by 53 percent.

Employee
    Retirement Plans

In March 2009, the Board of Directors approved freezing all
    future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic
    qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans. The
    freeze was effective January 1, 2010. As a result of this
    action, the liabilities for these plans were remeasured and we
    recognized a curtailment charge of $8 million in the first
    quarter of 2009. In addition, certain assumptions appropriate
    for on-going plans (e.g., turnover, mortality and compensation
    increases) were modified or eliminated for the remeasurement.

Accounting for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating
    the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon
    vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the
    time period each employee works. We develop our pension costs
    and obligations from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these
    valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected
    return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation increases
    and discount rates for obligations and expenses. We consider
    current market conditions, including changes in interest rates,
    in selecting these assumptions. Changes in assumptions used
    could result in changes to reported pension costs and
    obligations within our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, we decreased our discount rate for obligations
    to an average of 5.30 percent from 5.80 percent. The
    discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected
    duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities
    matched to the December 31, 2010 Towers Watson Rate Link
    curve. The discount rates we use for our defined-benefit pension
    plans ranged from 2.30 percent to 5.55 percent, with
    the most significant portion of the liabilities having a
    discount rate for obligations of 5.00 percent or higher.
    The assumed asset return was primarily 7.25 percent,
    reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.

Our net underfunded amount for our qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans, which is the difference between the projected
    benefit obligation and plan assets, increased to
    $359 million at December 31, 2010 from
    $332 million at December 31, 2009, primarily due to
    lower rates of return in the bond market in 2010. In accordance
    with accounting guidance, the underfunded amount has been
    recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. Qualified domestic pension plan
    assets in 2010 had a net gain of approximately 12 percent
    compared to average gains of 13 percent for the corporate
    funds universe within the Independent Consultant Cooperative.

Our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non-qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans was $163 million at
    December 31, 2010 compared with $152 million at
    December 31, 2009. This unfunded amount has been recognized
    on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2010 and
    2009.

We expect pension expense for our qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans to be $24 million in 2011 compared with
    $23 million in 2010. If we assumed that the future return
    on plan assets was one-half percent lower than the assumed asset
    return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points,
    the 2011 pension expense would increase by $4 million. We
    expect pension expense for our non-qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans to be $9 million in 2011 compared with
    $9 million in 2010.

We have several funding options and credits available and we
    anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately
    $30 million to $35 million in 2011 to our qualified
    defined-benefit plans.



Income
    Taxes

The accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the
    future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the
    existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods.
    Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in
    carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable
    temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability,
    tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in
    excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and
    projected future taxable income.

If, based upon all available evidence, both positive and
    negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent
    likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a
    valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to
    positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A
    company’s three-year cumulative loss position is
    significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred
    tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts
    the amount of reliance the Company can place on projected
    taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax
    assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a $371 million
    valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal deferred tax
    assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. In reaching
    this conclusion, we considered the weaker retail sales of
    certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated
    recovery in the U.S. housing market which led to
    U.S. operating losses and significant U.S. goodwill
    impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth
    quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative
    U.S. loss position. These factors negatively impact our
    ability to utilize previously identified tax-planning strategies
    that included the potential sale of certain non-core operating
    assets to support the realization of our U.S. Federal
    deferred tax assets, since current year losses are heavily
    weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the
    carryforward period to realize the benefit of the strategies.

Recording the valuation allowance does not restrict our ability
    to utilize the future deductions and net operating losses
    associated with the deferred tax assets assuming taxable income
    is recognized in future periods.

A rebound in the U.S. housing market from the current
    historic lows and retail sales of building products improving
    from their current levels should have a positive impact on our
    operating results in the U.S. A return to sustained
    profitability in the U.S. should result in objective
    positive evidence thereby warranting consideration of our
    previously identified tax-planning strategies and the potential
    reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance.

The $228 million of deferred tax assets at
    December 31, 2010, for which there are no valuation
    allowance recorded, is anticipated to be realized through the
    future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences
    recorded as deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2010.

Should we determine that we would not be able to realize our
    remaining deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to
    the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such
    determination is made. The need to maintain a valuation
    allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater
    volatility in our effective tax rate.

The current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only
    those income tax positions that have a greater than
    50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination
    by the taxing authorities. We believe that there is an increased
    potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this
    threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the
    inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number
    of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for
    uncertain tax positions to a greater extent.

While we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain
    tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary
    from our accrued liability for uncertain tax positions.
    Accordingly, additional provisions for tax-related matters,
    including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income
    tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the
    underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.



Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Certain of our products and product finishes and services are
    covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and
    workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the
    product. At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for
    estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair
    or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. Our
    estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that we experience any changes in
    warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those
    claims, our warranty liability is adjusted accordingly.

The majority of our business is at the consumer retail level
    through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return
    a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However,
    certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and
    other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from
    us. Our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type
    of return when recognizing revenue, and we record deductions at
    the time of sale.

We are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the
    ordinary course of our business. Liabilities and costs
    associated with these matters require estimates and judgments
    based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of
    our legal counsel. When estimates of our exposure for lawsuits
    and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition
    under accounting guidance, amounts are recorded as charges to
    earnings. The ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ
    due to subsequent developments. See Note S to our
    consolidated financial statements for information regarding
    certain of our legal proceedings.

Corporate
    Development Strategy

Our current business strategy includes the rationalization of
    our business units, including consolidations, and increasing
    synergies among our business units. Going forward, we expect to
    maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow,
    organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new
    product development,

start-up

businesses related to home energy services and greenfield
    locations related to certain Installation and Other Services
    businesses. As part of our strategic planning, we continue to
    review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may
    not be core to our long-term growth strategy.

During 2010, we did not sell any business unit or acquire any
    business. We accounted for the business units which were sold in
    2009 and 2008, as discontinued operations. See Note B to
    the consolidated financial statements for more information. The
    results of all acquisitions are included in the consolidated
    financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Historically, we have largely funded our growth through cash
    provided by a combination of our operations, long-term bank debt
    and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by the
    issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain
    mergers and acquisitions.

Maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash
    generation are among our financial strategies; such strategies
    have resulted in cash of over $1.7 billion at
    December 31, 2010. Our total debt as a percent of total
    capitalization was 72 percent and 58 percent at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

On June 21, 2010, the Company entered into a Credit
    Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a bank group,
    with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion with a
    maturity date of January 10, 2014. Our previous

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of November 5, 2004, as
    amended, was terminated at that time.

The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit
    facility available to the Company and one of its foreign
    subsidiaries, in U.S. dollars, European euros and certain
    other currencies. Borrowings under the revolver denominated in
    euros are limited to $500 million, equivalent. The Company
    can also borrow swingline loans up to $150 million and
    obtain letters of credit of up to $250 million. Any
    outstanding Letters of



Credit reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had $99 million of
    outstanding and unused Letters of Credit, reducing the
    Company’s borrowing capacity by such amount.

Our revolving credit loans bear interest under the Credit
    Agreement, at the Company’s option: at (A) a rate per
    annum equal to the greatest of (i) prime rate,
    (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50% and
    (iii) LIBOR plus 1.0% (the “Alternative Base
    Rate”); plus an applicable margin based upon the
    then-applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company; or
    (B) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the
    then-applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company. The
    foreign currency revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate
    equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the
    then-applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company.

The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the
    Company to maintain (A) a maximum debt to total
    capitalization ratio of 65 percent, and (B) a minimum
    interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than (i) 2.25
    to 1.0 through the quarter ending on September 30, 2011 and
    (ii) 2.50 to 1.0 thereafter. The debt to total
    capitalization ratio allows the add-back, if incurred, of up to
    the first $500 million of certain non-cash charges,
    including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment
    charges, occurring from and after April 1, 2010, that would
    negatively impact shareholders’ equity.

Based on the limitations of the debt to total capitalization
    covenant (before the amendment discussed below), at
    December 31, 2010, the Company had additional borrowing
    capacity, subject to availability, of up to $113 million.
    Alternatively, at December 31, 2010, the Company could
    absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately
    $61 million, and remain in compliance with the debt to
    total capitalization covenant.

In order to borrow under the Credit Agreement, there must not be
    any default in the Company’s covenants in the Credit
    Agreement (i.e., in addition to the two financial covenants,
    principally limitations on subsidiary debt, negative pledge
    restrictions, legal compliance requirements and maintenance of
    properties and insurance) and the Company’s representations
    and warranties in the Credit Agreement must be true in all
    material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no
    material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a
    material adverse change, since December 31, 2009, in each
    case, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance and no
    material tax deficiency). The Company was in compliance with all
    covenants and no borrowings have been made at December 31,
    2010.

On February 11, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment
    (deemed to be effective and applicable as of December 31,
    2010) of the Credit Agreement with its bank group (the
    “Amendment”). The Amendment provides for the add-back
    to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s maximum debt
    to capitalization covenant of (i) certain non-cash charges
    (including impairment charges for financial investments,
    goodwill and other intangible assets) and (ii) changes to
    the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in
    income tax expense, each taken in 2010, which aggregate
    $986 million after tax. The Amendment also permits the
    Company to add-back, if incurred, up to $350 million in the
    aggregate of future non-cash charges. We currently have
    borrowing capacity approximating $1 billion available under
    the Credit Agreement.

We have no scheduled maturities until July 2012 when
    $791 million of 5.875% fixed rate notes become due. The
    holders of the Company’s Zero Coupon Convertible Senior
    Notes (“Notes”) have the right to redeem the Notes for
    cash on July 20, 2011 for approximately $58 million.
    The next cash redemption date is July 20, 2016.

We had cash and cash investments of over $1.7 billion at
    December 31, 2010, principally as a result of strong cash
    flows from operations. Our cash and cash investments consist of
    overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit
    accounts, money market mutual funds containing government
    securities and treasury obligations. While we attempt to
    diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize
    risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial
    markets could affect the security or availability of these
    investments.

We have maintained investments in

available-for-sale

and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds,
    principally as part of our tax planning strategies, as any gains
    enhance the utilization of any



current and future capital tax losses. We determined that the
    longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous
    and complement our investment in more liquid

available-for-sale

and marketable securities to balance risk. Since we have
    significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by
    generating capital gains from investments and other sources, we
    have and will continue to reduce our investments in long-term
    financial assets.

During 2010, we paid a quarterly dividend of $.075 per common
    share.

Our working capital ratio was 2.3 to 1 and 1.9 to 1 at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
    manage exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to
    the European euro and the U.S. dollar. We have also entered
    into commodity contracts related to copper and zinc.

Our cash and cash investments increased $302 million to
    $1,715 million at December 31, 2010, from
    $1,413 million at December 31, 2009.

Net cash provided by operations of $465 million consisted
    primarily of net (loss) adjusted for non-cash and certain other
    items, including depreciation and amortization expense of
    $279 million, a $721 million charge for the impairment
    of goodwill and other intangible assets, a $168 million net
    change in deferred taxes, a $67 million charge for the
    impairment of long-lived assets related to the closure of a
    cabinet facility, a $34 million charge for the impairment
    of financial investments and other non-cash items, including
    stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense related
    to in-store displays and interest expense on the Zero Coupon
    Convertible Senior Notes, as well as a net decrease in working
    capital of $49 million.

We continue to emphasize balance sheet management, including
    working capital management and cash flow generation. Days sales
    in accounts receivable were 47 days at December 31,
    2010 compared with 48 days at December 31, 2009, and
    days sales in inventories were 49 days at December 31,
    2010 and



48 days at December 31, 2009. Accounts payable days
    were 51 days at December 31, 2010 and 47 days at
    December 31, 2009. Working capital (defined as accounts
    receivable and inventories less accounts payable) as a percent
    of sales was 13.4 percent at December 31, 2010 and
    14.7 percent at December 31, 2009; such improvement
    was primarily due to improved accounts payable management.

Net cash used for financing activities was $40 million, and
    included $359 million for the retirement of notes (retired
    $300 million of floating rate notes on March 12, 2010,
    the scheduled maturity date and, during the second quarter of
    2010, we repurchased $59 million of 5.875% Notes due
    July 2012, in open-market transactions), partially offset by
    $494 million from the issuance of Notes, net of issuance
    costs. Financing activities also include cash outflows of
    $108 million for cash dividends paid, $2 million for
    the net payment of debt and $45 million for the acquisition
    of our common stock to offset the dilutive impact of long-term
    stock awards granted in 2010.

At December 31, 2010, we had remaining Board of
    Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to an additional
    27 million shares of our common stock in open-market
    transactions or otherwise. We believe that our present cash
    balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund
    our near-term working capital and other investment needs. We
    believe that our longer-term working capital and other general
    corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from
    operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings
    and future financial market activities. Consistent with past
    practice, we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2011 to offset
    any dilution from long-term stock awards granted or stock
    options exercised as part of our compensation programs.

Net cash used for investing activities was $109 million,
    and included $137 million for capital expenditures. Cash
    provided by investing activities included primarily
    $18 million of net proceeds from the disposition of
    property and equipment and $42 million from the net sale of
    financial investments.

We invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase
    our productivity, improve customer service and support new
    product innovation. Capital expenditures for 2010 were
    $137 million, compared with $125 million for 2009 and
    $200 million for 2008; for 2011, capital expenditures,
    excluding any potential 2011 acquisitions, are expected to be
    approximately $230 million. Depreciation and amortization
    expense for 2010 totaled $279 million, compared with
    $254 million for 2009 and $238 million for 2008; for
    2011, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any
    potential 2011 acquisitions, is expected to be approximately
    $260 million. Amortization expense totaled
    $18 million, $17 million and $17 million in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with
    existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor do
    we expect them to have, a material effect on our capital
    expenditures, financial position or results of operations.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

We report our financial results in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United
    States. However, we believe that certain non-GAAP performance
    measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide
    users of this financial information with additional meaningful
    comparisons between current results and results in prior
    periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be
    viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our
    reported results.

Sales
    and Operations

Net sales for 2010 were $7.6 billion, representing a
    decrease of three percent from 2009. Excluding results from
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales
    decreased two percent compared



with 2009. The following table reconciles reported net sales to
    net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency
    translation, in millions:

Net sales for 2010 were adversely affected by lower sales volume
    of installation and other services and cabinets, which, in
    aggregate, reduced sales by approximately three percent compared
    to 2009. Net sales for 2010 were also negatively affected by
    lower sales volume of builders’ hardware and North American
    plumbing products, which reduced net sales by approximately one
    percent compared to 2009. Such declines were partially offset by
    a more favorable product mix of plumbing products and paints and
    stains, which increased sales by approximately one percent
    compared to 2009. Net sales volume in 2010 of our International
    plumbing products and windows increased in local currencies and
    increased consolidated net sales by approximately one percent
    compared to 2009. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by
    one percent compared to 2009.

Net sales for 2009 were adversely affected by declines in the
    new home construction market, which reduced sales volume by
    approximately nine percent compared to 2008. Net sales for 2009
    were also negatively affected by declines in consumer spending
    for home improvement products, which contributed to lower sales
    volume, reducing net sales by approximately six percent compared
    to 2008. Such declines were partially offset by net selling
    price increases for certain products, which increased sales by
    approximately one percent compared to 2008. Net sales volume in
    2009 of our International products declined in local currencies
    and reduced consolidated net sales by approximately three
    percent compared to 2008. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased
    sales by two percent compared to 2008.

Our gross profit margins were 24.2 percent,
    25.9 percent and 24.9 percent in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The decrease in the 2010 gross profit margin
    reflects lower sales volume, increased depreciation expense
    related to plant closures and a less favorable relationship
    between selling prices and commodity costs. Such decreases were
    partially offset by the benefits associated with our business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
    sales were 21.3 percent in 2010 compared with
    21.8 percent in 2009 and 19.0 percent in 2008.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
    sales in 2010 and 2009 reflect lower sales volume, increased
    advertising expenses related to new product introductions and
    increased system implementation costs.

Operating (loss) profit in 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes
    $208 million, $94 million and $78 million, net,
    respectively, of costs and charges related to our business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating
    (loss) profit in 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes $721 million,
    $262 million and $467 million, respectively, of
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets.
    Operating (loss) profit in 2009 includes $7 million of
    charges for litigation settlements. Operating (loss) profit
    margins, as reported, were (6.6) percent, 0.7 percent and
    0.9 percent in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating
    profit margins, excluding the items above, were
    5.7 percent, 5.4 percent and 6.8 percent in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Operating margins in 2010 were positively affected by the
    benefits associated with business rationalizations and other
    cost savings initiatives, which more than offset the negative
    effect of lower sales volume and the less favorable relationship
    between selling prices and commodity costs.



Operating profit margins in 2009 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed
    costs and lower selling prices related to the decline in the new
    home construction market in North America as well as lower sales
    volume of plumbing products in the North American and
    International home improvement markets. Such declines in 2009
    were partially offset by increased sales of paints and stains,
    the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity
    costs across our businesses and the benefits associated with
    business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.
    Operating profit margins in 2008 were adversely affected by
    accelerating declines in new home construction and a continued
    decline in consumer spending in North American and International
    markets, both of which negatively impacted the sales volume in
    each of our segments.

Other
    Income (Expense), Net

During 2010, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
    aggregating $34 million related to financial investments
    ($28 million related to Asahi Tec preferred stock and
    $6 million related to private equity funds and other
    private investments).

Other, net, for 2010 included $9 million of income from
    financial investments, net. Other, net, for 2010 also included
    realized foreign currency losses of $2 million and other
    miscellaneous items.

During 2009, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
    aggregating $10 million for our investments in private
    equity funds.

Other, net, for 2009 included $3 million of income from
    financial investments, net. Other, net, for 2009 also included
    realized foreign currency gains of $17 million and other
    miscellaneous items.

During 2008, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges
    aggregating $58 million primarily related to financial
    investments in TriMas common stock ($31 million), Asahi Tec
    common stock ($1 million), private equity funds
    ($23 million) and other investments ($3 million).

Other, net, for 2008 included $3 million of realized
    losses, net, from the sale of marketable securities and
    $4 million of income from other investments, net. Other,
    net, for 2008 also included realized foreign currency losses of
    $29 million and other miscellaneous items.

Interest expense was $251 million, $225 million and
    $228 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    increase in interest expense in 2010 is primarily due to the
    issuance of $500 million of 7.125% notes in March.

(Loss)
    Income and (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing
    Operations (Attributable to Masco Corporation)

(Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing
    operations for 2010 were $(1,043) million and $(3.00) per
    common share, respectively. (Loss) and diluted (loss) per common
    share from continuing operations for 2009 were
    $(140) million and $(.41) per common share, respectively.
    (Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing
    operations for 2008 were $(366) million and $(1.06) per
    common share, respectively. (Loss) from continuing operations
    for 2010 included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for
    goodwill and other intangible assets of $721 million
    ($593 million or $1.70 per common share, after tax). (Loss)
    from continuing operations for 2009 included non-cash, pre-tax
    impairment charges for goodwill of $262 million
    ($180 million or $.51 per common share, after tax). (Loss)
    from continuing operations for 2008 included non-cash, pre-tax
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of
    $467 million ($445 million or $1.26 per common share,
    after tax).

Our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations
    was a 29 percent tax expense, a 33 percent tax benefit
    and a 69 percent tax expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Our effective tax rate for the loss from
    continuing operations, excluding the $371 million income
    tax expense related to a valuation allowance on our
    U.S. Federal deferred tax assets recorded in 2010 and
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles, was a
    32 percent tax benefit, a 30 percent tax expense and a
    57 percent tax expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Compared to our normalized effective tax rate of
    36 percent, the lower



effective tax rate in 2009 is due primarily to the reversal of
    an accrual for uncertain tax positions related to a withholding
    tax issue from a formerly held European company due to a
    favorable court decision. The higher effective tax rate in 2008
    reflects the additional U.S. tax on a repatriation of
    low-taxed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to
    utilize a foreign tax credit carryforward, combined with a
    decrease in 2008 pre-tax income.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a $371 million
    valuation allowance against our U.S. Federal deferred tax
    assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. In reaching
    this conclusion, we considered the weaker retail sales of
    certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated
    recovery in the U.S. housing market which led to
    U.S. operating losses and significant U.S. goodwill
    impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth
    quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative
    U.S. loss position. These factors negatively impact our
    ability to utilize previously identified tax-planning strategies
    that included the potential sale of certain non-core operating
    assets to support the realization of our U.S. Federal
    deferred tax assets, since current year losses are heavily
    weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the
    carryfoward period to realize the benefits of the strategies.

Outlook
    for the Company

Although we continue to be concerned about foreclosure activity
    and access to financing, housing starts did improve in 2010 to
    588,000 units. The negative trends impacting our business
    in the second half of 2010, including depressed new home
    construction, lower big-ticket repair and remodel activity and
    commodity cost pressures, have continued into 2011. We expect a
    challenging business environment, particularly in the first half
    of 2011; we expect the second half of 2011 to be stronger.

In addition to strategic rationalization and the continued
    emphasis on cash generation, we have identified, directed and
    encouraged initiatives at our business units that we expect will
    position us to benefit from future opportunities as the recovery
    takes shape. We have also led a focused effort to strengthen our
    brands and improve our ability to execute our business models.
    The implementation of the Masco Business System (MBS) across our
    business units provides a more disciplined approach to managing
    our businesses and has enhanced our long-range planning process.
    MBS emphasizes five core capabilities: customer focus,
    innovation, lean, quality and talent, which we believe are
    fundamental to our long-term success. MBS is already having a
    positive impact on our businesses as we enhance our
    understanding of customer and end-consumer needs, improve
    product quality and incorporate sustainability into our
    operations and products. As a result, we believe we have a
    robust pipeline of innovative new products. In addition, we are
    also improving our operational performance by emphasizing
    process and productivity improvements, simplifying
    organizational structure, rationalizing supply chains and
    enhancing our talent management process.

We believe and are confident that the long-term fundamentals for
    the new home construction and home improvement markets continue
    to be positive. We believe that our strong financial position,
    together with our current strategy of investing in leadership
    brands, including KRAFTMAID and MERILLAT cabinets, DELTA and
    HANSGROHE faucets, BEHR paint and MILGARD windows, our continued
    focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles, will
    allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our
    shareholders.

    corporate expense, net, charge for defined-benefit plan
    curtailment, charge for litigation settlements, accelerated
    stock compensation expense, loss on corporate fixed assets, net,
    and impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets
    in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Business
    Rationalizations and Other Initiatives

Over the past several years, we have been focused on the
    strategic rationalization of our businesses, including business
    consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system
    implementations and other cost savings initiatives. For the year
    ended December 31, 2010, we incurred net costs and charges
    of $208 million pre-tax related to these initiatives. For
    the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred net costs and
    charges of $94 million pre-tax related to these
    initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we
    incurred net costs and charges of $78 million pre-tax
    related to these initiatives.

As announced in February 2010, we have combined our Builder
    Cabinet Group and Retail Cabinet Group to form Masco
    Cabinetry. In 2010, we incurred costs and charges related to the
    integration of $20 million; in 2011, we expect to incur an
    additional $10 million of costs and charges related to the
    integration. In April 2010, Masco Cabinetry decided to
    discontinue the manufacture of

ready-to-assemble

and other non-core in-stock assembled cabinet product lines as
    they are not consistent with Masco Cabinetry’s strategy of
    growth through brand building and innovation. These product
    lines had aggregate annual sales of approximately
    $200 million in 2009. We plan to close two manufacturing
    facilities associated with these products in the first half of
    2011. In 2010, we incurred costs and charges related to the exit
    of these product lines of $84 million, including non-cash
    charges of $69 million, principally related to accelerated
    depreciation for property, plant and equipment, and
    $15 million of other cash charges. In 2011, we expect to
    incur an additional $25 million of costs and charges
    related to the closure of the facilities associated with these
    product lines. In 2010, we also decided to close a cabinet
    manufacturing facility that had been previously idled; we
    incurred costs and charges related to the closure of
    $67 million. As a result of these actions within the
    Cabinets and Related Products segment, in 2010, we incurred
    pre-tax $171 million of total costs and charges related to
    Masco Cabinetry integration, product line exit and facility
    closure. In total, as described above, we expect to incur an
    additional $35 million of costs and charges related to
    these actions in 2011.

Based on current plans, we anticipate costs and charges related
    to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to
    approximate $65 million in 2011. We continue to evaluate
    our businesses and may implement additional rationalization
    programs based on changes in our markets which could result in
    further costs and charges.

Cabinets
    and Related Products

Sales

Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased in 2010
    primarily due to lower sales volumes of North American cabinets,
    which reduced sales by approximately six percent compared to
    2009. Sales in this segment in 2010 were also negatively
    affected by the planned exit of

ready-to-assemble

and other non-core in-stock assembled cabinet product lines,
    particle board and door product lines, which reduced sales by
    approximately four percent compared to 2009. Sales were also
    negatively affected by lower sales volume of International
    cabinets, which reduced sales in this segment by approximately
    three percent compared to 2009. A stronger U.S. dollar
    decreased sales by one percent in 2010 compared to 2009.

Net sales in this segment decreased in 2009 primarily due to a
    decline in sales volume in the new home construction and retail
    markets, as well as a less favorable product mix, which combined
    to reduce sales by approximately 24 percent compared to
    2008. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by two percent
    in 2009 compared to 2008.



Net sales in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by a
    decline in sales volume in the new home construction and retail
    markets, as well as a less favorable product mix and lower local
    currency sales of International operations.

Operating
    Results

Operating margins in the Cabinets and Related Products segment
    in 2010 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the
    related under-absorption of fixed costs, which reduced operating
    profit margins by approximately three percentage points.
    Operating profit margins in this segment in 2010 were also
    negatively affected by increased business rationalization
    expenses and a less favorable relationship between selling
    prices and commodity costs; such decreases more than offset the
    benefits associated with business rationalizations and other
    cost savings initiatives.

Operating margins in this segment in 2009 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume in the new home construction and
    retail markets and the related under-absorption of fixed costs,
    as well as a less favorable product mix which, on a combined
    basis, reduced operating profit margins by approximately three
    percentage points compared to 2008. In 2009, operating profit
    margins in this segment were also negatively affected by
    increased plant closure and system implementation costs which
    were partially offset by the improved relationship between
    selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated
    with business rationalizations and other cost savings
    initiatives.

Operating margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume and the related under-absorption
    of fixed costs and a less favorable product mix, as well as
    lower results of International operations included in this
    segment.

Plumbing
    Products

Sales

Net sales of Plumbing Products increased in 2010 primarily due
    to a more favorable product mix to North American retailers
    and wholesalers, which increased sales by approximately two
    percent compared to 2009. Sales were also positively affected by
    increased selling prices, which increased sales by approximately
    two percent compared to 2009. In local currencies, sales of
    International operations increased sales in this segment by
    approximately three percent compared to 2009. Such increases
    were partially offset by lower sales volume to North American
    retailers and wholesalers, which reduced sales by one percent
    compared to 2009. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by
    one percent in 2010 compared to 2009.

Net sales in this segment decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily
    due to lower sales volume to North American retailers and
    wholesalers, which reduced sales by approximately ten percent in
    2009 compared to 2008. Reflecting the weakened global economy,
    net sales in this segment in 2009 and 2008 were also negatively
    impacted by lower local currency sales volume of International
    operations. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by three
    percent in 2009 compared to 2008.

Operating
    Results

Operating margins in the Plumbing Products segment in 2010 were
    positively affected by a more favorable product mix and the
    positive relationship between selling prices and commodity costs
    and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and
    other cost savings initiatives.

Operating margins in this segment in 2009 were positively
    affected by the improved relationship between selling prices and
    commodity costs, as well as a more favorable product mix and the
    benefits associated with business rationalizations and other
    cost savings initiatives.

Operating margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively
    affected by the decline in North American and International
    sales volume; such declines were partially offset by net selling
    price increases.



Installation
    and Other Services

Sales

Net sales in the Installation and Other Services segment
    decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower sales volume related to
    reduced share in the new home construction market. Sales in this
    segment were also negatively affected by a downward trend in the
    size and content of new houses being constructed by our builder
    customers.

Net sales in this segment decreased in 2009 and 2008, primarily
    due to significantly lower sales volume related to the decline
    in the new home construction market, as well as lower selling
    prices.

Operating
    Results

Operating margins in the Installation and Other Services segment
    in 2010 continue to be negatively affected by lower sales volume
    in the new home construction market and the related
    under-absorption of fixed costs, as well as a less favorable
    relationship between selling prices and commodity costs.
    Additionally, investments in
    WellHome

SM

negatively impacted this segment by approximately one percentage
    point. Such declines were partially offset by the benefits
    associated with business rationalization and other cost savings
    initiatives and lower system implementation costs in 2010.

Operating margins in this segment in 2009 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume and the related under-absorption
    of fixed costs, selling price decreases and increased system
    implementation costs in 2009.

Operating margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume and the related under-absorption
    of fixed costs, as well as decreased selling prices and
    increased bad debt expense; such declines were partially offset
    by material price decreases.

Decorative
    Architectural Products

Sales

Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products decreased in
    2010, primarily due to lower sales volume of builders’
    hardware and lower selling prices of paints and stains. Such
    declines in 2010 were partially offset by a more favorable
    product mix of paints and stains, related to new product
    introductions.

Net sales in this segment increased in 2009, primarily due to
    increased sales volume of paints and stains, which offset lower
    sales volume of builders’ hardware.

Net sales in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume of paints and stains and builders’
    hardware, which more than offset selling price increases.

Operating
    Results

Operating margins in the Decorative Architectural Products
    segment in 2010 were negatively affected by a less favorable
    relationship between selling prices and commodity costs related
    to paints and stains, as well as lower sales volume of
    builders’ hardware. Such declines more than offset the
    benefit of a more favorable product mix of paints and stains,
    related to new product introductions.

Operating margins in this segment in 2009 were positively
    affected by increased sales volume of paints and stains, which
    more than offset lower sales volume of builders’ hardware.
    The operating profit margins in this segment in 2009 also
    benefited from the improved relationship between selling prices
    and commodity costs related to paints and stains and
    builders’ hardware, as well as lower program costs related
    to builders’ hardware.

Operating margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume of paints and stains and
    builders’ hardware, increasing material costs throughout
    2008 and program costs for builders’ hardware. Such
    declines more than offset the effect of selling price increases.



Other
    Specialty Products

Sales

Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased in 2010
    primarily due to increased sales volume of windows in North
    America, principally related to the energy-savings tax credit,
    which expired at the end of 2010, which increased sales in this
    segment by approximately one percent compared to 2009. Net sales
    were also positively affected by increased sales volume of
    staple gun tackers and other fastening tools, which increased
    sales in this segment by approximately one percent compared to
    2009.

Net sales in this segment in 2009 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume of windows, selling price decreases and a
    less favorable product mix, which decreased sales in this
    segment by approximately 12 percent in 2009 compared to
    2008. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by three
    percent in 2009 compared to 2008.

Net sales in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume of windows, as well as a decline in the home
    improvement market.

Operating
    Results

Operating margins in the Other Specialty Products segment in
    2010 reflect the negative effect of a less favorable
    relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and a
    less favorable windows product mix. Such declines offset the
    benefits associated with business rationalizations and other
    cost savings initiatives.

Operating margins in this segment in 2009 reflect the benefits
    associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings
    initiatives which offset the negative effect of lower sales
    volume of windows and staple gun tackers and other fastening
    tools and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, as well
    as a less favorable product mix.

Operating margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume and the related under-absorption
    of fixed costs, increased plant closure costs and the lower
    results of International operations.

Geographic
    Area Results Discussion

North
    America

Sales

North American net sales in 2010 were negatively impacted by
    lower sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets,
    plumbing products, and builders’ hardware, which, in the
    aggregate, decreased sales by approximately four percent
    compared to 2009. Such declines were partially offset by a more
    favorable product mix of plumbing products and paints and
    stains, which increased sales by approximately one percent
    compared to 2009.

North American net sales in 2009 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets
    and windows in the new home construction market which decreased
    sales from North American operations by approximately 12
    percent in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition,
    North American net sales in 2009 were negatively affected
    by lower retail sales volume of cabinets, plumbing products,
    builder’s hardware and staple gun tackers and other
    fastening tools, which aggregated to a net decrease in North
    American net sales of approximately nine percent in 2009
    compared to 2008.

North American net sales in 2008 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets
    and windows and doors in the new home construction market.



Operating
    Results

The declines in operating profit margins from North American
    operations in 2010 were primarily due to lower sales volume and
    the related under-absorption of fixed costs and a less favorable
    relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, which
    decreased operating profit margins by two percentage point in
    2010 compared to 2009. Operating profit margins were also
    negatively affected by increased business rationalization costs
    and charges in 2010 compared to 2009.

The declines in operating profit margins from North American
    operations in 2009 were primarily due to sales volume declines
    and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, selling price
    decreases and a less favorable product mix in new home
    construction markets, which decreased operating profit margins
    by one percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating
    profit margins were also negatively affected by increased
    rationalization costs and charges in 2009 compared to 2008. Such
    declines were partially offset by the improved relationship
    between selling prices and commodity costs for cabinets,
    plumbing products and paints and stains, as well as the benefits
    associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings
    initiatives.

Operating profit margins from North American operations in 2008
    were negatively affected by declines in new home construction
    and consumer spending, which negatively impacted the sales
    volume of our products.

International,
    Principally Europe

Sales

Net sales from International operations increased in local
    currencies by approximately five percent compared to 2009,
    primarily due to increased sales volume and increased selling
    prices of International plumbing products and windows, offset by
    lower sales volume of International cabinets. A stronger
    U.S. dollar decreased International net sales by five
    percent in 2010 compared to 2009.

Net sales from International operations decreased in 2009
    primarily due to lower sales volume of plumbing products and
    cabinets, which reduced sales from International operations in
    local currencies by approximately 12 percent compared to
    2008. Such declines in 2009 were partially offset by selling
    price increases. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased
    International net sales by seven percent in 2009 compared to
    2008.

Net sales from International operations in 2008 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume of plumbing products and cabinets.

Operating
    Results

Operating profit margins from International operations in 2010
    were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix,
    partially offset by the benefits associated with business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating profit margins in 2009 were positively affected by the
    improved relationship between selling prices and commodity
    costs, as well as the benefits associated with business
    rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.

Operating profit margins in 2008 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volumes and the related under-absorption of fixed
    costs, as well as increased severance and plant closure costs.



Other
    Matters

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

Information regarding our legal proceedings is set forth in
    Note S to the consolidated financial statements.

Other
    Commitments

With respect to our investments in private equity funds, we had,
    at December 31, 2010, commitments to contribute up to
    $33 million of additional capital to such funds,
    representing our aggregate capital commitment to such funds less
    capital contributions made to date. We are contractually
    obligated to make additional capital contributions to these
    private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the
    private equity fund. We have no control over when or if the
    capital calls will occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and
    generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our
    investment in the private equity fund when paid.

We enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary
    indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which
    we operate. Such indemnifications include claims made against
    builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and
    workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other
    transactions, we occasionally provide reasonable and customary
    indemnifications relating to various items, including: the
    enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues;
    and provisions for sales returns. We have never had to pay a
    material amount related to these indemnifications, and we
    evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and we
    appropriately record an estimated liability when probable.

(A)

We assumed that all debt would be held to maturity, except for
    the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes which have been
    classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2010. See
    Note K to the consolidated financial statements for more
    information.

(B)

There is no schedule for the capital commitments to the private
    equity funds; such allocation was estimated.

(C)

Excludes contracts that do not require volume commitments and
    open or pending purchase orders.

(D)

Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of
    future cash outflows associated with uncertain tax positions, we
    are unable to make a reasonable estimate for the period beyond
    the next year in which cash settlements may occur with
    applicable tax authorities.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new FASB guidance
    regarding how a company determines when an entity is
    insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting
    and should be consolidated. The adoption of this guidance did
    not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition and
    results of operations.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We have considered the provisions of accounting guidance
    regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative
    financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, and
    disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about
    market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments, other
    financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments.

We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates,
    foreign currency exchange rates and commodity costs in the
    normal course of business and to market price fluctuations
    related to our marketable securities and other investments. We
    have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
    and use such instruments to the extent necessary to manage
    exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and from time to time
    commodity fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information regarding our
    derivative instruments.

At December 31, 2010, we have entered into foreign currency
    forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations
    related primarily to the European euro and the U.S. dollar.
    At December 31, 2010, we have also entered into several
    contracts to manage our exposure to increases in the price of
    copper and zinc.

At December 31, 2010, we performed sensitivity analyses to
    assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk
    sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of
    10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates, a
    10 percent decline in the market value of our long-term
    investments or a 10 percent change in commodity costs.
    Based upon the analyses performed, such changes would not be
    expected to materially affect our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Masco Corporation is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Masco Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

The management of Masco Corporation assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010 using the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.” Based on this assessment, management has
    determined that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, performed an audit of the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of
    Masco Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010. Their report expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Masco
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010 and expressed an unqualified opinion
    on the Company’s 2010 consolidated financial statements.
    This report appears under Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data under the heading Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of
    Directors and Shareholders

of Masco Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Masco
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Masco Corporation
    and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
    consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations
    of variable interest entities, for which the Company is the
    primary beneficiary.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of
    Financial Statements.

The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America requires the
    Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
    the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ
    from these estimates and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to
    customers or when services are rendered, net of applicable
    provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. The Company
    records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon
    estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other
    Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables.
    Amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in net
    sales, while costs incurred for shipping and handling are
    included in cost of sales.

Customer Promotion Costs.

The Company records
    estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and
    incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative
    advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based
    incentives. In-store displays that are owned by the Company and
    used to market the Company’s products are included in other
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized
    using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of
    three years; related amortization expense is classified as a
    selling expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Foreign Currency.

The financial statements of
    the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the
    local currency as the functional currency. Assets and
    liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at exchange
    rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are
    translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year.
    The resulting cumulative translation adjustments have been
    recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component
    of shareholders’ equity. Realized foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated
    statements of income in other income (expense), net.

Cash and Cash Investments.

The Company
    considers all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity
    of three months or less to be cash and cash investments.

Receivables.

The Company does significant
    business with a number of customers, including certain home
    centers and homebuilders. The Company monitors its exposure for
    credit losses on its customer receivable balances and the credit
    worthiness of its customers on an on-going basis and records
    related allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are
    estimated based upon specific customer balances, where a risk of
    default has been identified, and also include a provision for
    non-customer specific defaults based upon historical collection,
    return and write-off activity. During downturns in the
    Company’s markets, declines in the financial condition and
    creditworthiness of customers impacts the credit risk of the
    receivables involved and the Company has incurred additional bad
    debt expense related to customer defaults. A separate allowance
    is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally
    based upon sales activity. Receivables are presented net of
    certain allowances (including allowances for doubtful accounts)
    of $65 million and $75 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Receivables include unbilled
    revenue related to the Installation and Other Services segment
    of $12 million and $15 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Continued)

Property and Equipment.

Property and
    equipment, including significant betterments to existing
    facilities, are recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal,
    the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts and any gain or loss is included in the consolidated
    statements of income. Maintenance and repair costs are charged
    against earnings as incurred.

The Company reviews its property and equipment as an event
    occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not
    reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the
    carrying amount. If the carrying amount of property and
    equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows,
    then the Company would recognize an impairment loss for the
    difference between the carrying amount and the current fair
    value. Further, the Company evaluates the remaining useful lives
    of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine
    whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the
    remaining depreciation periods.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense is computed
    principally using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets. Annual depreciation rates are as
    follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10 percent,
    and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation
    expense was $261 million, $237 million and
    $220 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

The
    Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill in
    the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or
    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The
    Company has defined its reporting units and completed the
    impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level,
    as defined by accounting guidance. The Company’s operating
    segments are reporting units that engage in business activities,
    for which discrete financial information, including five-year
    forecasts, are available. The Company compares the fair value of
    the reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting units
    for goodwill impairment testing. Fair value is determined using
    a discounted cash flow method, which includes significant
    unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).

Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method
    requires the Company to make significant estimates and
    assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows,
    market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The
    Company’s judgments are based upon historical experience,
    current market trends, consultations with external valuation
    specialists and other information. In estimating future cash
    flows, the Company relies on internally generated five-year
    forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital
    expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term
    assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the
    five-year forecast. The Company generally utilizes its weighted
    average cost of capital (discount rate) of approximately eight
    percent to discount the estimated cash flows. However, in 2010
    and 2009, due to market conditions, the Company increased the
    discount rate to a range of nine percent to eleven percent for
    most of its reporting units, based upon a review of the current
    risks impacting our businesses. The Company records an
    impairment to goodwill (adjusting the value to the estimated
    fair value) if the book value is below the estimated fair value,
    on a non-recurring basis.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or
    as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets
    may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit. The
    Company considers the implications of both external (e.g.,
    market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and
    internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth)
    factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the
    intangible asset in both the near- and long-term.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using
    the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The

periods of amortization. See Note H for additional
    information regarding Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Fair Value Accounting.

On January 1,
    2008, the Company adopted accounting guidance for its financial
    investments and liabilities which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. On January 1,
    2009, the Company adopted this guidance for its non-financial
    investments and liabilities; such adoption did not have a
    significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of financial investments and liabilities is
    determined at each balance sheet date and future declines in
    market conditions, the future performance of the underlying
    investments or new information could affect the recorded values
    of the Company’s investments in marketable securities,
    private equity funds and other private investments.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage
    certain exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows
    resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
    commodity costs. Derivative financial instruments are recorded
    in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or
    liability measured at fair value. For each derivative financial
    instrument that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value
    hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as
    the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to
    the hedged risk, are recognized in determining current earnings
    during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative
    instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or
    loss is recognized in determining current earnings during the
    period of the change in fair value.

Warranty.

At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions.

A majority of the Company’s business is at the consumer
    retail level through home centers and major retailers. A
    consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
    warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not
    distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when
    they claim a return deduction from the Company. The
    Company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account
    this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are
    recorded at the time of sale.

Product Liability.

The Company provides for
    expenses associated with product liability obligations when such
    amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The
    accruals are adjusted as new information develops or
    circumstances change that would affect the estimated liability.

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company measures
    compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of the
    Company’s common stock at the grant date. Effective
    January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably
    over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards,
    typically 5 to 10 years (except for stock awards held by
    grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or
    the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible
    at age 65. For stock awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized over the
    vesting period of the stock awards, typically 10 years, or
    for executive grantees that are, or will become,
    retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the expense is
    being recognized over five years or immediately upon a
    grantee’s retirement.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock options
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is
    being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of
    time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing

model. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006,
    such expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years. The Company utilizes
    the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool
    associated with stock options.

Noncontrolling Interest.

The Company owns
    68 percent of Hansgrohe AG at both December 31, 2010
    and 2009. The aggregate noncontrolling interest, net of
    dividends, at December 31, 2010 and 2009 has been recorded
    as a component of equity on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets.

Interest and Penalties on Uncertain Tax
    Positions.

The Company records interest and
    penalties on its uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior-year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation in
    the consolidated financial statements. In the Company’s
    consolidated statements of cash flows, the cash flows from
    discontinued operations are not separately classified.

Recently Issued Accounting
    Pronouncements.

Effective January 1, 2010,
    the Company adopted new FASB guidance regarding how a company
    determines when an entity is insufficiently capitalized or is
    not controlled through voting and should be consolidated. The
    adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of
    operations.

B.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

During 2009 and 2008, the Company sold several business units
    that were not core to the Company’s long-term growth
    strategy. The presentation of discontinued operations includes a
    component of the Company, which comprises operations and cash
    flows, that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the
    Company. The Company has accounted for the business units which
    were sold in 2009 and 2008 as discontinued operations.

During 2009, in separate transactions, the Company completed the
    sale of Damixa and Breuer, two European business units in the
    Plumbing Products segment. The Company received gross proceeds
    of $9 million and recognized a net pre-tax loss of
    $43 million for the sale of these business units.

During 2009, the Company recorded income of $1 million
    included in (loss) gain on disposal of discontinued operations,
    net related to cash received for a disposition completed in
    prior years. Also during 2009, the Company recorded other income
    of $2 million included in (loss) gain on disposal of
    discontinued operations, net, reflecting the settlement of
    certain liabilities related to a business unit disposed in prior
    years.

During 2008, in separate transactions, the Company completed the
    sale of its Europe-based The Heating Group business unit (Other
    Specialty Products segment), Glass Idromassaggio (Plumbing
    Products segment) and Alfred Reinecke (Plumbing Products
    segment). Total net proceeds from the sale of these business
    units were $174 million. The Company recorded an impairment
    of assets related to these discontinued operations which
    primarily included the write-down of goodwill of
    $24 million and other assets of $21 million; upon
    completion of the transactions, the Company recognized a net
    gain of $6 million included in (loss) gain on disposal of
    discontinued operations, net. During 2008, the Company recorded
    other net expenses of $3 million included in (loss) gain on
    disposal of discontinued operations, net, reflecting the
    adjustment of certain liabilities related to businesses disposed
    in prior years.

(Losses) gains from these 2009 and 2008 discontinued operations
    were included in (loss) from discontinued operations, net, in
    the consolidated statements of income.

    between income taxes and (loss) before income taxes resulted
    primarily from certain losses providing no current tax benefit.

C.

ACQUISITIONS

During 2009, the Company acquired a small business in the
    Plumbing Products segment; this business allows the Company to
    expand into a developing market and had annual sales of
    $11 million. During 2008, the Company acquired a relatively
    small countertop business (Cabinet and Related Products segment)
    which allows the Company to expand the products and services it
    offers to its customers and had annual sales of over
    $40 million.

The results of all acquisitions are included in the consolidated
    financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.

The total net cash purchase price of these acquisitions was
    $6 million and $18 million, respectively, in 2009 and
    2008.

Certain purchase agreements provided for the payment of
    additional consideration in cash, contingent upon whether
    certain conditions are met, including the operating performance
    of the acquired business. In 2008, the Company paid in cash an
    additional $1 million of acquisition-related consideration,
    contingent consideration and other purchase price adjustments,
    relating to previously acquired companies. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, there was no outstanding contingent consideration.

FAIR
    VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND LIABILITIES

Accounting Policy.

On January 1, 2008,
    the Company adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements for its financial
    investments and liabilities. The guidance defines fair value as
    “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
    to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date.” Further, it defines
    a fair value hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 inputs as
    quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities; Level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar
    assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can
    be corroborated by market data; and Level 3 inputs as
    unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and that are financial instruments whose value is
    determined using pricing models or instruments for which the
    determination of fair value requires significant management
    judgment or estimation.

Financial investments that are available to be traded on readily
    accessible stock exchanges (domestic or foreign) are considered
    to have active markets and have been valued using Level 1
    inputs. Financial investments that are not available to be
    traded on a public market or have limited secondary markets, or
    contain provisions that limit the ability to sell the investment
    are considered to have inactive markets and have been valued
    using Level 2 or 3 inputs. The Company incorporated credit
    risk into the valuations of financial investments by estimating
    the likelihood of non-performance by the counterparty to the
    applicable transactions. The estimate included the length of
    time relative to the contract, financial condition of the
    counterparty and current market conditions. The criteria for
    determining if a market was active or inactive were based on the
    individual facts and circumstances.

Financial Investments.

The Company has
    maintained investments in

available-for-sale

securities and a number of private equity funds and other
    private investments, principally as part of its tax planning
    strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current
    and future tax capital losses.

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments are carried at cost. At December 31,
    2010, the Company has investments in 17 venture capital funds,
    with an aggregate carrying

    LIABILITIES – (Continued)

value of $22 million. The venture capital funds invest in

start-up

or
    smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the
    information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors.
    At December 31, 2010, the Company also has investments in
    26 buyout funds, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $84 million. The buyout funds invest in later-stage,
    established businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in
    a particular sector.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

For
    financial investments measured at fair value on a recurring
    basis at each reporting period, the unrealized gains or losses
    (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax
    effect, through shareholders’ equity, as a component of
    other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and
    charges for

other-than-temporary

impairments are included in determining net income, with related
    purchase costs based upon specific identification.

For marketable securities, the Company reviews, on a recurring
    basis, industry analyst reports, key ratios and statistics,
    market analyses and other factors for each investment to
    determine if an unrealized loss is

other-than-temporary.

In the past, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate
    securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities
    that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or
    35 days. The fair values of the auction rate securities
    held by the Company have been estimated, on a recurring basis,
    using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). The
    significant inputs in the discounted cash flow model used to
    value the auction rate securities include: expected maturity of
    auction rate securities, discount rate used to determine the
    present value of expected cash flows and assumptions for credit
    defaults, since the auction rate securities are backed by credit
    default swap agreements.

In 2009, the Company sold its holdings of Asahi Tec common stock
    for proceeds approximating book value.

During the second quarter of 2010, Asahi Tec approached the
    Company with an offer to amend the terms of the preferred stock
    held by the Company. The request was made by Asahi Tec in order
    to facilitate early negotiations with their bank group for debt
    that matures in early 2011. The Company and Asahi Tec agreed to
    amend the preferred stock to include a more favorable conversion
    feature into common stock and to include a mandatory conversion
    date of February 28, 2011. The Company agreed to this
    amendment based on favorable tax benefits related to the Asahi
    Tec investment. Prior to this amendment, the Company could have
    settled in cash or common stock in 2017. As a result of the
    amendment, the Company recognized a $28 million impairment
    loss based on the current fair value of the preferred stock on
    an if-converted basis at June 30, 2010. Also, as a result
    of the amendment, the Company reversed an unrealized gain of
    $23 million that was previously included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income. During the last six months of 2010,
    the Company converted all its holdings of Asahi Tec preferred
    stock into common stock which was sold, in its entirety, in open
    market transactions. The Company realized cash proceeds of
    $11 million and realized losses aggregating $8 million
    in 2010. As a result of the disposition of the Asahi Tec common
    stock, the Company will receive a tax refund of $16 million
    in 2011 relating to the utilization of a loss carryback to
    offset taxes paid on prior capital gains.

In the past, the preferred stock of Asahi Tec was valued
    primarily using a discounted cash flow model, because there were
    previously no observable prices in an active market for the same
    or similar securities. The significant inputs in the discounted
    cash flow model previously used to value the Asahi Tec preferred
    stock included: the present value of future dividends, present
    value of redemption rights, fair value of conversion rights and
    the discount rate based on credit spreads for Japanese-issued
    preferred securities (approximately 600 basis points at
    December 31, 2009) and other market factors.

During 2010, the Company sold 481,000 shares of its
    investment in TriMas common stock for cash of $10 million.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

It is
    not practicable for the Company to estimate a fair value for
    private equity funds and other private investments because there
    are no quoted market prices, and sufficient information is not
    readily available for the Company to utilize a valuation model
    to determine the fair value for each fund. These investments are
    evaluated, on a non-recurring basis, for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an
    event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.

Impairment indicators the Company considers include the
    following: whether there has been a significant deterioration in
    earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a
    significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or
    technological environment; a significant adverse change in the
    general market condition or geographic area in which the
    investment operates; industry and sector performance; current
    equity and credit market conditions; and any bona fide offers to
    purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. The
    Company also considers specific adverse conditions related to
    the financial health of and business outlook for the fund,
    including industry and sector performance. The significant
    assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment include current economic conditions, market analysis
    for specific funds and performance indicators in the residential
    and commercial construction, bio-technology, health care and
    information technology sectors in which the applicable
    funds’ investments operate. Since there is no active
    trading market for these investments, they are for the most part
    illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also have a
    relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial
    leverage, than other financial investments. Future changes in
    market conditions, the future performance of the underlying
    investments or new information provided by private equity fund
    managers could affect the recorded values of such investments
    and the amounts realized upon liquidation. Due to the
    significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements
    used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3 input.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

Financial

The remaining private equity investments in 2010 and 2009 with
    an aggregate carrying value of $104 million and
    $92 million, respectively, were not reviewed for
    impairment, as there were no indicators of impairment or
    identified events or changes in circumstances that would have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.

Realized Gains (Losses) and Impairment
    Charges.

During 2010, based on information from
    the fund manager, the Company determined that the decline in the
    estimated value of three private equity funds (with an aggregate
    carrying value of $6 million prior to impairment) was

other-than-temporary

and, accordingly, recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges of $4 million. During 2010, the Company also
    determined that the decline in the estimated value of one
    private investment was

other-than-temporary

and, accordingly, recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charge of $2 million. The Company did not have any
    transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets
    in 2010 or 2009.

During 2009, the Company determined that the decline in the
    estimated value of five private equity funds, with an aggregate
    carrying value of $41 million prior to impairment, was

other-than-temporary.

Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of
    $10 million.

During 2008, based upon its review of marketable securities, the
    Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of
    $31 million related to its investment in TriMas Corporation
    (“TriMas”) common stock (NYSE: TRS) and
    $1 million related to its investment in Asahi Tec
    Corporation (“Asahi Tec”) common stock (Tokyo Stock
    Exchange: 5606.T). During 2008, the Company determined that the
    decline in the estimated value of certain private equity fund
    investments, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $66 million prior to the impairment, was

other-than-temporary.

Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of
    $23 million. A review of sector performance and other
    factors specific to the underlying investments in six funds
    having

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, including the Heartland Fund (automotive
    and transportation sector of $10 million) and five other
    funds ($13 million.)

The impairment charges related to the Company’s financial
    investments recognized during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were based
    upon then-current estimates for the fair value of certain
    financial investments; such estimates could change in the
    near-term based upon future events and circumstances.

The fair value of the Company’s short-term and long-term
    fixed-rate debt instruments is based principally upon quoted
    market prices for the same or similar issues or the current
    rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and
    remaining maturities. The aggregate estimated market value of
    short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2010 was
    approximately $4.2 billion, compared with the aggregate
    carrying value of $4.1 billion. The aggregate estimated
    market value of short-term and long-term debt at
    December 31, 2009 was approximately $3.9 billion,
    compared with the aggregate carrying value of $4.0 billion.

DERIVATIVES

At December 31, 2010, the Company, including certain
    European operations, had entered into foreign currency forward
    contracts with notional amounts of $43 million and
    $6 million to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in
    the European euro and the U.S. dollar, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company, including certain European
    operations, had entered into foreign currency forward contracts
    with notional amounts of $55 million and $10 million
    to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in the European euro
    and the U.S. dollar, respectively. Based upon year-end
    market prices, the Company had recorded (losses) gains of
    $(2) million and $(1) million to reflect the contract
    prices at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Gains
    (losses) related to these contracts are recorded in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of income in other income
    (expense), net. In the event that the counterparties fail to
    meet the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts, the
    Company’s exposure is limited to the aggregate foreign
    currency rate differential with such institutions.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had entered into foreign
    currency exchange contracts to hedge currency fluctuations
    related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional
    currencies with notional amounts of $3 million. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had recorded a
    $4 million loss on the foreign

currency exchange contract, which was more than offset by gains
    related to the translation of loans and accounts denominated in
    non-functional currencies.

During 2010, the Company entered into several contracts to
    manage its exposure to increases in the price of copper and
    zinc. Based upon period-end market prices, the Company had
    recorded assets of $7 million to reflect contract prices at
    December 31, 2010. Gains (losses) related to these
    contracts are recorded in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of income in cost of goods sold. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company had recorded gains of
    $7 million related to these contracts.

The fair value of these derivative contracts is estimated on a
    recurring basis, quarterly, using Level 2 inputs
    (significant other observable inputs).

In 2009, the Company recognized a decrease in interest expense
    of $10 million related to the amortization of the gains
    resulting from the terminations (in 2008 and 2004) of two
    interest rate swap agreements. In 2008, the Company recognized a
    decrease in interest expense of $12 million related to the
    interest rate swap agreements.

The Company leases certain equipment and plant facilities under
    noncancellable operating leases. Rental expense recorded in the
    consolidated statements of income totaled approximately
    $111 million, $135 million and $161 million
    during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future minimum lease
    payments at December 31, 2010 were approximately as
    follows: 2011 — $75 million; 2012 —
    $48 million; 2013 — $28 million;
    2014 — $18 million; and 2015 and
    beyond — $76 million.

The Company leases operating facilities from certain related
    parties, primarily former owners (and in certain cases, current
    management personnel) of companies acquired. The Company
    recorded rental expense to such related parties of approximately
    $6 million, $8 million and $10 million in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

During 2010, the Company decided to permanently close and hold
    for sale a cabinet manufacturing facility that had previously
    been idled. As a result of this decision, the Company estimated
    a fair value for the manufacturing facility using a market
    approach, considering the estimated fair values for other
    comparable buildings in the area where the facility is located
    (Level 2 inputs). The Company determined that there had
    been a decline in the estimated value of the facility and,
    accordingly, recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of
    $67 million. The carrying value of the manufacturing
    facility was $99 million prior to impairment.

In the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, the Company completed
    its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets. During each year, and prior
    to the fourth quarter testing, there were no events or
    circumstances that would have indicated potential impairment.

The impairment tests in 2010 and 2009 indicated that goodwill
    recorded for certain of the Company’s reporting units was
    impaired. The Company recognized the non-cash, pre-tax
    impairment charges for goodwill of $711 million
    ($587 million, after tax) and $262 million
    ($180 million, after tax) for 2010 and 2009,

respectively. In 2010, the pre-tax impairment charge in the
    Installation and Other Services segment reflects the
    Company’s expectation that the recovery in the new home
    construction market will be modestly slower than previously
    anticipated. In 2009, the pre-tax impairment charge in the
    Plumbing Products segment relates to a European shower enclosure
    manufacturer; the pre-tax impairment charge in the Other
    Specialty Products segment relates to the Company’s North
    American manufacturer of staple gun tackers and other fastening
    tools. The impairment charges in 2009 reflect the anticipated
    long-term outlook for the reporting units, including declining
    demand for certain products, as well as decreased operating
    profit margins.

Other indefinite-lived intangible assets were $185 million
    and $196 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, and principally included registered trademarks. In
    2010, the impairment test indicated that the registered
    trademark for several small installation service businesses in
    North America in the Installation and Other Services segment and
    the registered trademark for a North American business unit in
    the Plumbing Products segment were impaired due to changes in
    the anticipated long-term outlook for the business units. The
    Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for
    other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $10 million
    ($6 million, after tax) in 2010.

The carrying value of the Company’s definite-lived
    intangible assets was $84 million at December 31, 2010
    (net of accumulated amortization of $75 million) and
    $94 million at December 31, 2009 (net of accumulated
    amortization of $67 million) and principally included
    customer relationships and non-compete agreements, with a
    weighted average amortization period of 15 years in both
    2010 and 2009. Amortization expense related to the
    definite-lived intangible assets was $11 million,
    $11 million and $16 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2010, amortization expense related to the
    definite-lived intangible assets during each of the next five
    years was as follows: 2011 — $11 million;
    2012 — $10 million; 2013 —
    $9 million; 2014 — $9 million; and
    2015 — $9 million.

DEBT – (Continued)

The Company retired $300 million of floating rate notes on
    March 12, 2010, the scheduled maturity date.

During 2010, the Company repurchased $59 million of
    5.875% Notes due July 2012, in open-market transactions.
    The Company paid a premium of $2 million over par value on
    the purchase of the notes; this cost was included in interest
    expense.

In July 2001, the Company issued $1.9 billion principal
    amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
    2031 (“Old Notes”), resulting in gross proceeds of
    $750 million. The issue price per Note was $394.45 per
    $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented a yield
    to maturity of 3.125% compounded semi-annually. In December
    2004, the Company completed an exchange of the outstanding Old
    Notes for Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes Series B due
    July 2031 (“New Notes or Notes”). The Company will not
    pay interest in cash on the Notes prior to maturity, except in
    certain circumstances, including possible contingent interest
    payments that are not expected to be material. Holders of the
    Notes have the option to require that the Notes be repurchased
    by the Company on July 20, 2011 and every five years
    thereafter. Upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will pay
    the principal return, equal to the lesser of (1) the
    accreted value of the Notes in only cash, and (2) the
    conversion value, as defined, which will be settled in cash or
    shares of Company common stock, or a combination of both, at the
    option of the Company. The Notes are convertible if the average
    price of Company common stock for the 20 days immediately
    prior to the conversion date exceeds 117%, declining by 1/3%
    each year thereafter, of the accreted value of the Notes divided
    by the conversion rate of 12.7317 shares for each $1,000
    principal amount at maturity of the Notes. Notes also become
    convertible if the Company’s credit rating is reduced to
    below investment grade, or if certain actions are taken by the
    Company. The Company may at any time redeem all or part of the
    Notes at their then accreted value. On January 20, 2007,
    holders of $1.8 billion (94 percent) principal amount
    at maturity of the Notes required the Company to repurchase
    their Notes at a cash value of $825 million.

A credit rating agency (i.e., Moody’s or Standard and
    Poor’s) is an entity that assigns credit ratings for
    issuers of certain types of debt obligations. In December 2008,
    one rating agency reduced the credit rating on the
    Company’s debt to below investment grade; as a result, the
    Notes are convertible on demand. The Company does not anticipate
    conversion of the Notes since, based on the terms, it would not
    currently be profitable for holders of the Notes to exercise the
    option to convert the Notes.

At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were outstanding
    $108 million principal amount at maturity of Notes, with an
    accreted value of $57 million and $55 million,
    respectively, which has been reclassified to short-term debt.

On June 21, 2010, the Company entered into a Credit
    Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a bank group,
    with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion with a
    maturity date of January 10, 2014. The Company’s

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of November 5, 2004, as
    amended, was terminated at that time.

The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit
    facility available to the Company and one of its foreign
    subsidiaries, in U.S. dollars, European euros and certain
    other currencies. Borrowings under the revolver denominated in
    euros are limited to $500 million, equivalent. The Company
    can also borrow swingline loans up to $150 million and
    obtain letters of credit of up to $250 million. Any
    outstanding Letters of Credit reduce the Company’s
    borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2010, the Company had
    $99 million of outstanding and unused Letters of Credit,
    reducing the Company’s borrowing capacity by such amount.

Revolving credit loans bear interest under the Credit Agreement,
    at the Company’s option: at (A) a rate per annum equal
    to the greatest of (i) prime rate, (ii) the Federal
    Funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.0%
    (the “Alternative Base Rate”); plus an applicable
    margin based upon the then-applicable corporate credit ratings
    of the Company; or (B) LIBOR plus an applicable margin
    based upon the then-applicable



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

K.

DEBT – (Concluded)

corporate credit ratings of the Company. The foreign currency
    revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR
    plus an applicable margin based upon the then-applicable
    corporate credit ratings of the Company.

The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the
    Company to maintain (A) a maximum debt to total
    capitalization ratio of 65 percent, and (B) a minimum
    interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than (i) 2.25
    to 1.0 through the quarter ending on September 30, 2011 and
    (ii) 2.50 to 1.0 thereafter. The debt to total
    capitalization ratio allows the add-back, if incurred, of up to
    the first $500 million of certain non-cash charges,
    including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment
    charges, occurring from and after April 1, 2010, that would
    negatively impact shareholders’ equity.

Based on the limitations of the debt to total capitalization
    covenant (before the amendment discussed below), at
    December 31, 2010, the Company had additional borrowing
    capacity, subject to availability, of up to $113 million.
    Alternatively, at December 31, 2010, the Company could
    absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately
    $61 million, and remain in compliance with the debt to
    total capitalization covenant.

In order to borrow under the Credit Agreement, there must not be
    any default in the Company’s covenants in the Credit
    Agreement (i.e., in addition to the two financial covenants,
    principally limitations on subsidiary debt, negative pledge
    restrictions, legal compliance requirements and maintenance of
    properties and insurance) and the Company’s representations
    and warranties in the Credit Agreement must be true in all
    material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no
    material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a
    material adverse change, since December 31, 2009, in each
    case, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance and no
    material tax deficiency).

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company was in
    compliance with the requirements of the New Credit Agreement and
    the Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as applicable.

There were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the
    Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, as applicable.

Subsequent Event.

On February 11, 2011,
    the Company entered into an amendment (deemed to be effective
    and applicable as of December 31, 2010) of the Credit
    Agreement with its bank group (the “Amendment”). The
    Amendment provides for the add-back to shareholders’ equity
    in the Company’s maximum debt to capitalization covenant of
    (i) certain non-cash charges (including impairment charges
    for financial investments and goodwill and other intangible
    assets) and (ii) changes to the valuation allowance on the
    Company’s deferred tax assets included in income tax
    expense, each taken in 2010, which aggregate $986 million
    after tax. The Amendment also permits the Company to add-back,
    if incurred, up to $350 million in the aggregate of future
    non-cash charges. We currently have borrowing capacity
    approximating $1 billion available under the Credit
    Agreement.

At December 31, 2010, the maturities of long-term debt
    during each of the next five years were as follows:
    2011 — $66 million; 2012 —
    $808 million; 2013 — $201 million;
    2014 — $1 million; and 2015 —
    $501 million.

Interest paid was $241 million, $226 million and
    $232 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) provides for the issuance of stock-based
    incentives in various forms to employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. At December 31, 2010, outstanding
    stock-based incentives were in the form of long-term stock
    awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock
    appreciation rights.

    and options) related to the retirement from full-time employment
    of the Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board of
    Directors; he continues to serve as a non-executive,
    non-employee Chairman of the Board of Directors.

At December 31, 2010, a total of 11,860,100 shares of
    Company common stock were available under the 2005 Plan for the
    granting of stock options and other long-term stock incentive
    awards.

Long-Term
    Stock Awards

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and
    non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share
    dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of
    repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open
    market.

    shares which vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to key employees of the Company. The
    exercise price equals the market price of the Company’s
    common stock at the grant date. These options generally become

Phantom
    Stock Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights
    (“SARs”)

The Company grants phantom stock awards and SARs to certain

non-U.S. employees.

Phantom stock awards are linked to the value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant and are settled
    in cash upon vesting, typically over 5 to 10 years. The
    Company accounts for phantom stock awards as liability-based
    awards; the compensation expense is initially measured as the
    market price of the Company’s common stock at the grant
    date and is recognized over the vesting period. The liability is
    remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period
    until the awards are fully-vested and paid to the employees. The
    Company recognized expense (income) of $2 million,
    $3 million and $(2) million related to the valuation
    of phantom stock awards for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company granted 299,650 shares,
    318,920 shares and 234,800 shares, respectively, of
    phantom stock awards with an aggregate fair value of
    $4 million, $3 million and $5 million,
    respectively, and paid $1 million, $1 million and
    $2 million of cash in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to
    settle phantom stock awards.

SARs are linked to the value of the Company’s common stock
    on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon exercise. The
    Company accounts for SARs using the fair value method, which
    requires outstanding SARs to be classified as liability-based
    awards and valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model at
    the grant date; such fair value is recognized as compensation
    expense over the vesting period, typically five years. The
    liability is remeasured and adjusted at the end of each
    reporting period until the SARs are exercised and payment is
    made to the employees or the SARs expire. The Company recognized
    expense (income) of $1 million, $4 million and
    $(3) million related to the valuation of SARs for 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company granted SARs for 429,300 shares,
    438,200 shares and 597,200 shares, respectively, with
    an aggregate fair value of $2 million, $1 million and
    $2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

EMPLOYEE
    RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors qualified defined-benefit and
    defined-contribution retirement plans for most of its employees.
    In addition to the Company’s qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans, the Company has unfunded non-qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans covering certain employees, which
    provide for benefits in addition to those provided by the
    qualified pension plans. Substantially all salaried employees
    participate in non-contributory defined-contribution retirement
    plans, to which payments are determined annually by the
    Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. Aggregate charges to earnings under the
    Company’s defined-benefit and defined-contribution
    retirement plans were $37 million and $47 million in
    2010, $63 million and $35 million in 2009 and
    $38 million and $30 million in 2008, respectively.

In March 2009, based on management’s recommendation, the
    Board of Directors approved a plan to freeze all future benefit
    accruals under substantially all of the Company’s domestic
    qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans. The
    freeze was effective January 1, 2010. As a result of this
    action, the liabilities for the plans impacted by the freeze
    were remeasured and the Company recognized a curtailment charge
    of $8 million in the first quarter of 2009.

    $16 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

The Company’s qualified defined-benefit pension plans have
    adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes
    a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. Accounting guidance defines fair
    value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date.”

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used
    for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in
    the methodologies used at December 31, 2010.

Common and preferred stocks, debt securities and short-term
    and other investments:

Valued at the closing
    price reported on the active market on which the individual
    securities are traded.

Limited Partnerships:

Valued based on an
    estimated fair value. There is no active trading market for
    these investments and they are for the most part illiquid. Due
    to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value
    measurements are a Level 3 input.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation
    that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective
    of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes
    its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other
    market participants, the use of different methodologies or
    assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial
    instruments could result in a different fair value measurement
    at the reporting date.

The discount rate for obligations for 2010 was based upon the

    liabilities matched to the December 31, 2010 Towers Watson
    Rate Link Curve. Such rates for the Company’s defined
    benefit pension plans ranged from 2.30 percent to
    5.55 percent, with the most significant portion of the
    liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of
    5.0 percent or higher at

December 31, 2010. The decline in the weighted average
    discount rate to 5.3 percent in 2010 from 5.8 percent
    in 2009 was principally the result of lower long-term interest
    rates in the bond market in 2010. The discount rate for
    obligations for 2009 was based upon the expected duration of
    each defined-benefit plan’s liabilities matched to the
    widely used Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and Liability index
    for December 31, 2009. The weighted average discount rates
    in 2010 and 2009 were also affected by the freezing of all
    future benefit accruals for substantially all of the
    Company’s domestic qualified and non-qualified
    defined-benefit plans, which shortened the period of future
    payments.

The Company determined the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets of 7.25 percent based upon an analysis of
    expected and historical rates of return of various asset classes
    utilizing the current and long-term target asset allocation of
    the plan assets. The projected asset return at December 31,
    2010 also considered near term returns, including current market
    conditions and also that pension assets are long-term in nature.
    The actual annual rate of return on the Company’s pension
    plan assets was 4.3 percent and 3.3 percent for the

10-year

periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Although these rates of return are less than the Company’s
    current expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the
    Company notes that these

10-year

periods include two significant declines in the equity markets.
    Accordingly, the Company believes a 7.25 percent expected
    long-term rate of return is reasonable.

The investment objectives seek to minimize the volatility of the
    value of the Company’s plan assets relative to pension
    liabilities and to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay plan
    benefits. The Company, based upon discussions with its pension
    investment advisor, reduced its equity allocation to
    70 percent from 80 percent; increased its fixed-income
    allocation to 25 percent from 10 percent and allocated
    5 percent to alternative investments. The revised asset
    allocation of the investment portfolio was developed with the
    objective of achieving the Company’s expected rate of
    return and reducing volatility of asset returns, and considered
    the freezing of future benefits. The equity portfolios are
    invested in individual securities or funds that are expected to
    mirror broad market returns for equity securities. The
    fixed-income portfolio is invested in corporate bonds, bond
    index funds or U.S. Treasury securities. The increased
    allocation to fixed-income securities partially matches the
    bond-like and long-term nature of the pension liabilities. In
    2010, the pension investment advisor recommended that, longer
    term, the Company should achieve the following targeted asset
    portfolio: 45 percent equities, 25 percent
    fixed-income, 15 percent global assets (combination of
    equity and fixed-income) and 15 percent alternative
    investments (such as private equity, commodities and hedge
    funds). The Company expects to achieve this allocation by
    December 31, 2011. This targeted portfolio is expected to
    yield a long-term rate of return of 7.25 percent.

The fair value of the Company’s plan assets is subject to
    risk including significant concentrations of risk in the
    Company’s plan assets related to equity, interest rate and
    operating risk. In order to ensure plan assets are sufficient to
    pay benefits, a portion of plan assets is allocated to equity
    investments that are expected, over time, to earn higher returns
    with more volatility than fixed-income investments which more
    closely match pension liabilities. Within equity, risk is
    mitigated by targeting a portfolio that is broadly diversified
    by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size,
    investment style and process.

In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the
    liabilities, a portion of plan assets are allocated to
    fixed-income investments that are exposed to interest rate risk.
    Rate increases generally will result in a decline in
    fixed-income assets, while reducing the present value of the
    liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed
    income assets, partially offsetting the related increase in the
    liabilities.

The Company has targeted alternative investments such as hedge
    funds, private equity funds and commodities that are expected to
    comprise 15 percent of the pension assets. It is expected
    that the alternative investments would have a higher rate of
    return than the targeted overall long-term return of
    7.25 percent. However, these investments are subject to
    greater volatility, due to their nature, than a portfolio

of equities and fixed-income investments, and would be less
    liquid than financial instruments that trade on public markets.

Potential events or circumstances that could have a negative
    effect on estimated fair value include the risks of inadequate
    diversification and other operating risks. To mitigate these
    risks, investments are diversified across and within asset
    classes in support of investment objectives. Policies and
    practices to address operating risks include ongoing manager
    oversight, plan and asset class investment guidelines and
    instructions that are communicated to managers, and periodic
    compliance and audit reviews to ensure adherence to these
    policies. In addition, the Company periodically seeks the input
    of its independent advisor to ensure the investment policy is
    appropriate.

    otherwise. At December 31, 2010, the Company had remaining
    authorization to repurchase up to 27 million shares. During
    2010, the Company repurchased and retired three million shares
    of Company common stock, for cash aggregating $45 million
    to offset the dilutive impact of the 2010 grant of three million
    shares of long-term stock awards. The Company repurchased and
    retired two million common shares in 2009 and nine million
    common shares in 2008 for cash aggregating $11 million and

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION – (Continued)

The Company’s segments are based upon similarities in
    products and services and represent the aggregation of operating
    units, for which financial information is regularly evaluated by
    the Company’s corporate operating executives in determining
    resource allocation and assessing performance and is
    periodically reviewed by the Board of Directors. Accounting
    policies for the segments are the same as those for the Company.
    The Company primarily evaluates performance based upon operating
    profit (loss) and, other than general corporate expense,
    allocates specific corporate overhead to each segment. The
    evaluation of segment operating profit also excludes the charge
    for defined-benefit plan curtailment, the charge for litigation
    settlements, the accelerated stock compensation expense and the
    (loss) on corporate fixed assets, net.

Q.

INCOME
    TAXES – (Continued)

The accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the
    future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the
    existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods.
    Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in
    carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable
    temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability,
    tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in
    excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and
    projected future taxable income.

If, based upon all available evidence, both positive and
    negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent
    likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a
    valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to
    positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A
    company’s three-year cumulative loss position is
    significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred
    tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts
    the amount of reliance the Company can place on projected
    taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax
    assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a
    $371 million valuation allowance against its
    U.S. Federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to
    income tax expense. In reaching this conclusion, the Company
    considered the weaker retail sales of certain of its building
    products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the
    U.S. housing market which led to U.S. operating losses
    and significant U.S. goodwill impairment charges, that
    primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing the
    Company to be in a three-year cumulative U.S. loss
    position. These factors negatively impacted the Company’s
    ability to utilize previously identified tax-planning strategies
    that included the potential sale of certain non-core operating
    assets to support the realization of its U.S. Federal
    deferred tax assets, since current year losses are heavily
    weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the
    carryforward period to realize the benefit of the strategies.

Recording the valuation allowance does not restrict the
    Company’s ability to utilize the future deductions and net
    operating losses associated with the deferred tax assets
    assuming taxable income is recognized in future periods.

A rebound in the U.S. housing market from the current
    historic lows and retail sales of building products improving
    from their current levels should have a positive impact on the
    Company’s operating results in the U.S. A return to
    sustained profitability in the U.S. should result in
    objective positive evidence thereby warranting consideration of
    our previously identified tax-planning strategies and the
    potential reversal of all or a portion of the valuation
    allowance.

The $228 million of deferred tax assets at
    December 31, 2010, for which there is no valuation
    allowance recorded, is anticipated to be realized through the
    future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences
    recorded as deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2010.

The valuation allowance of $43 million as of
    December 31, 2009 consisted of certain state and foreign
    net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax asset
    balances that the Company believes would not be realized in
    future periods primarily due to the recent history of losses of
    certain subsidiaries.

Of the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss and
    tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    $143 million and $65 million will expire between 2019
    and 2030 and $5 million and $4 million is unlimited,
    respectively. The capital loss carryforward of $3 million
    at December 31, 2010 will expire in 2015.

A $9 million deferred tax liability has been provided at
    December 31, 2009 on the undistributed earnings of certain
    foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are intended to be
    repatriated in the foreseeable future. A tax provision has not
    been provided at December 31, 2010 for U.S. income
    taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately
    $60 million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign
    subsidiaries that are considered to be permanently reinvested.
    It is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred tax

During 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax impairment charges for
    goodwill and other intangible assets of $721 million
    ($593 million after-tax) that increased the effective tax
    rate as a portion of the impairment charges did not provide a
    tax benefit. In addition, the Company recorded a
    $371 million income tax expense related to a valuation
    allowance on its U.S. Federal deferred tax assets.
    Excluding the effects of these items, the Company’s
    effective tax rate in 2010 was approximately a 32% tax benefit
    on its 2010 pre-tax loss.

During 2009, the Company reversed an accrual for uncertain tax
    positions of approximately $8 million related to a
    withholding tax issue from a formerly held European company due
    to a favorable court decision which resulted in a decrease in
    the effective tax rate. In addition, the Company recorded
    pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill of $262 million
    ($180 million after-tax) in 2009 that increased the
    effective tax rate as a portion of the impairment charges did
    not provide a tax benefit. Excluding the effects of these items,
    the Company’s effective tax rate in 2009 was approximately
    37 percent.

During 2008, the Company made a substantial repatriation of
    low-taxed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to fully
    utilize the existing foreign tax credit carryforward by
    December 31, 2008. Although the majority of the current
    U.S. tax on this substantial repatriation was offset by the
    foreign tax credit carryforward, the Company’s tax expense
    was increased by approximately $65 million. Also during
    2008, the Company recorded pre-tax impairment charges for
    goodwill and other intangibles of $467 million
    ($445 million after-tax) that significantly increased the
    Company’s effective tax rate as the majority of the
    impairment charges did not provide a tax benefit. Excluding the
    effects of the substantial repatriation of low-taxed earnings
    and the impairment charges, the Company’s effective tax
    rate in 2008 was approximately 33 percent.

Income taxes paid were $47 million, $25 million and
    $117 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

If recognized, $47 million and $44 million of the
    liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, net of any U.S. Federal tax
    benefit, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $97 and $87 million of
    the total liability for uncertain tax positions, including
    related interest and penalties, is recorded in deferred income
    taxes and other, $5 and $8 million is recorded in accrued
    liabilities and $8 and $9 million is recorded in other
    assets, respectively.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal
    jurisdiction, and various local, state and foreign
    jurisdictions. The Company continues to participate in the
    Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). CAP is a
    real-time audit of the U.S. Federal income tax return that
    allows the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), working
    in conjunction with the Company, to determine tax return
    compliance with the U.S. Federal tax law prior to filing
    the return. This program provides the Company with greater
    certainty about its tax liability for a given year within
    months, rather than years, of filing its annual tax return and
    greatly reduces the need for recording a liability for
    U.S. Federal uncertain tax positions. The IRS has completed
    their examination of the Company’s consolidated
    U.S. Federal tax returns through 2009. With few exceptions,
    the Company is no longer subject to state or foreign income tax
    examinations on filed returns for years before 2000.

As a result of tax audit closings, settlements and the
    expiration of applicable statutes of limitations in various
    jurisdictions within the next 12 months, the Company
    anticipates that it is reasonably possible the liability for
    uncertain tax positions could be reduced by approximately
    $7 million.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted accounting
    guidance regarding determining whether instruments granted in
    share-based payment transactions are participating securities.
    This new accounting guidance clarifies that share-based payment
    awards that entitle their holders to receive non-forfeitable
    dividends prior to vesting should be considered participating
    securities. The Company has granted restricted stock awards that
    contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends on unvested shares;
    such unvested restricted stock awards are considered
    participating securities. As participating securities, the
    unvested shares are required to be included in the calculation
    of the Company’s basic earnings per common share, using the
    “two-class method.” The two-class method of computing
    earnings per common share is an allocation method that
    calculates earnings per share for each class of common stock and
    participating security according to dividends declared and
    participation rights in undistributed earnings. Unvested
    restricted stock awards were previously included in the
    Company’s diluted share calculation using the treasury
    stock method. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008, the Company allocated dividends to the unvested
    restricted stock awards (participating securities).

At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not
    include any common shares related to the Zero Coupon Convertible
    Senior Notes (“Notes”) in the calculation of diluted
    earnings per common share, as the price of the Company’s
    common stock at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 did not
    exceed the equivalent accreted value of the Notes.

Additionally, 37 million common shares, 36 million
    common shares and 31 million common shares for 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively, related to stock options were excluded
    from the computation of diluted earnings per common share due to
    their antidilutive effect.

Common shares outstanding included on the Company’s balance
    sheet and for the calculation of earnings per common share do
    not include unvested stock awards (10 million and nine
    million common shares at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively); shares outstanding for legal requirements
    included all common shares that have voting rights (including
    unvested stock awards).

OTHER
    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary
    course of business.

Early in 2003, a suit was brought against the Company and a
    number of its insulation installation companies in the federal
    court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleging that certain practices
    violate provisions of federal and state antitrust laws. The
    plaintiff publicized the lawsuit with a press release and stated
    in that release that the U.S. Department of Justice was
    investigating the business practices of the Company’s
    insulation installation companies. Although the Company was
    unaware of any investigation at that time, the Company was later
    advised that an investigation had been commenced but was
    subsequently closed without any enforcement action recommended.
    Two additional lawsuits were subsequently brought in Virginia
    making similar claims under the antitrust laws. Both of these
    lawsuits have since been dismissed without any payment or
    requirement for any change in business practices.

During the second half of 2004, the same counsel who commenced
    the initial action in Atlanta filed six additional lawsuits on
    behalf of several of Masco’s competitors in the insulation
    installation business. The plaintiffs then dismissed all of
    these lawsuits and, represented by the same counsel, filed
    another action in the same federal court as a putative class
    action against the Company, a number of its insulation
    installation companies and certain of their suppliers. All of
    the Company’s suppliers, who were co-defendants in this
    lawsuit, have settled this case. On February 9, 2009, the
    federal court in Atlanta issued an Opinion in which the Court
    certified a class of 377 insulation contractors. In its Opinion,
    the Court also ruled on various other motions. Two additional
    lawsuits, seeking class action status and alleging
    anticompetitive conduct, were filed against the Company and a
    number of its insulation suppliers. One of these lawsuits was
    filed in a Florida state court and has been dismissed by the
    court with prejudice. The other lawsuit was filed in federal
    court in northern California and was subsequently transferred to
    federal court in Atlanta, Georgia. This case has been
    administratively stayed by the court. The Company is vigorously
    defending the pending active case. Based upon the advice of its
    outside counsel, the Company believes that the conduct of the
    Company and its insulation installation companies, which has
    been the subject of the above-described lawsuits, has not
    violated any antitrust laws. The Company is unable at this time
    to reliably estimate any potential liability which might occur
    from an adverse judgment. There cannot be any assurance that the
    Company will ultimately prevail in the remaining lawsuits or, if
    unsuccessful, that the ultimate liability would not be material
    and would not have a material adverse effect on its businesses
    or the methods used by its insulation installation companies in
    doing business.

Warranty

Certain of the Company’s products and product finishes and
    services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in
    material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to
    the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any
    changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
    servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted
    accordingly.

Investments

With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity
    funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2010, commitments
    to contribute up to $33 million of additional capital to
    such funds representing the Company’s aggregate capital
    commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to
    date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional
    capital contributions to certain of its private equity funds
    upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. The
    Company has no control over when or if the capital calls will
    occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in
    an increase in the carrying value of the Company’s
    investment in the private equity fund when paid.

Other
    Matters

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and
    customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries
    in which it operates. Such indemnifications include customer
    claims against builders for issues relating to the
    Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with
    divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally
    provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to
    various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal
    and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and
    asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material
    amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the
    probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately
    records an estimated liability when probable.

Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure.

Not applicable.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of
    its disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange
    Act

Rules 13a-15(b)

and

15d-15(b)

as
    of December 31, 2010. Based on this evaluation, the
    Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting.

Management’s report on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) is included in this Report under
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under
    the heading, “Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting” and is incorporated herein by
    reference. The report of our independent registered public
    accounting firm is also included under Item 8, under the
    heading, “Report of Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm” and is incorporated herein by reference.

(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

The Company continued a phased deployment of a new Enterprise
    Resource Planning (“ERP”) system at Masco Contractor
    Services, one of the Company’s larger business units. This
    new system represents a process improvement initiative and is
    not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In February 2010, the Company announced plans to combine Masco
    Builder Cabinet Group and Masco Retail Cabinet Group to
    form Masco Cabinetry. The Company has combined these
    business units in order to realize planned efficiency gains.

The system implementation and business integration are designed,
    in part, to enhance the overall system of internal control over
    financial reporting through further automation and integration
    of various business processes. However, these business process
    initiatives are significant in scale and complexity and have
    resulted in modifications to certain internal controls.

Item 9B.

Other
    Information.

On February 11, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment
    (deemed to be effective and applicable as of December 31,
    2010) of its Credit Agreement with its bank group (the
    “Amendment”). The Amendment provides for the add-back
    to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s maximum debt
    to capitalization covenant of (i) certain non-cash charges
    (including impairment charges for financial investments and
    goodwill and other intangible assets) and (ii) changes to
    the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax
    assets included in income tax expense, each taken in 2010, which
    aggregate $986 million after tax. The Amendment also
    permits the Company to add-back, if incurred, up to
    $350 million in the aggregate of future non-cash charges.
    We currently have borrowing capacity approximating
    $1 billion available under the Credit Agreement.

Affiliates of The Bank of New York Mellon, a lender under the
    Credit Agreement, act as the Company’s transfer agent and
    as trustee under the Company’s indentures. In the ordinary
    course of their respective businesses, various lenders that are
    parties to the Credit Agreement or their affiliates have
    performed investment banking, commercial banking and other
    financial services for the Company and its affiliates, including
    acting as lenders under various loan facilities and as
    underwriters in offerings of the Company’s securities.
