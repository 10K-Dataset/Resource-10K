Cabinets and
    Related Products

In North America, the Company manufactures and sells economy,
    stock, semi-custom, assembled and

ready-to-assemble

cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home
    entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price
    points. In Europe, the Company manufactures and sells assembled
    and

ready-to-assemble

kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home entertainment
    cabinetry. These products are sold under a number of trademarks
    including
    KRAFTMAID

®

,
    MILL’S
    PRIDE

®

and
    TVILUM-SCANBIRK

tm

primarily to dealers and home centers, and under the names
    BLUESTONE

    MERILLAT

®

,
    MOORES

tm

and QUALITY
    CABINETS

®

primarily to distributors and directly to builders for both the
    home improvement and new home construction markets.

The cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States and
    Europe is highly competitive, with several large and hundreds of
    smaller competitors. The Company believes that it is the largest
    manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinetry in North America
    based on 2006 sales volume. Significant North American
    competitors include American Woodmark, Aristokraft, Diamond,
    Homecrest, Omega and Schrock.

The Company is significantly increasing the manufacturing
    capacity of North American assembled cabinet operations.

Plumbing
    Products

In North America, the Company manufactures and sells a wide
    variety of faucet and showering devices under several brand
    names. The most widely known of these are the
    DELTA

®

,
    PEERLESS

®

,
    BRIZO

®

,
    BRASSTECH

®

and NEWPORT
    BRASS

®

single and double handle faucets used in kitchen and lavatory
    sinks and in bath and shower applications. The Company’s
    faucets are sold by manufacturers’ representatives and
    Company sales personnel to major retail accounts and to
    distributors who sell the faucets to plumbers, building
    contractors, remodelers, smaller retailers and others.
    Showerheads, handheld showers and valves are sold under the
    brand names
    ALSONS

®

,
    DELTA, PEERLESS and PLUMB
    SHOP

®

    The Company manufactures kitchen and bath faucets, showering
    devices and various other plumbing products for European markets
    under the brand names
    AXOR

,
    DAMIXA

®

,
    GUMMERS

and
    NEWTEAM

tm

,
    which are sold through multiple distribution channels. In
    addition, AXOR and HANSGROHE products are sold in North America
    and the Far East through retailers and wholesalers.

Masco believes that its faucet operations are among the leaders
    in sales in the North American market, with American Standard,
    Kohler, Moen and Price Pfister as major brand competitors. The
    Company also has several major competitors, including Friedrich
    Grohe, among the European manufacturers of faucets and
    accessories, primarily in Germany and Italy. The Company also
    faces significant competition from private label products
    (including house brands sold by certain of the Company’s
    customers). Many of the faucet and showering device products
    with which the Company’s products compete are manufactured
    in Asia. As part of the Company’s strategy for its
    products, the Company’s North American businesses have been
    reducing the volume of products manufactured domestically and
    increasing the manufacturing and sourcing of products from Asia.

Other plumbing products manufactured and sold by the Company
    include AQUA
    GLASS

®

and
    MIROLIN

®

acrylic and gelcoat bath and shower units, which are sold

Installation and
    Other Services

The Company’s Installation and Other Services segment sells
    installed building products and distributes building products,
    primarily to the new home construction industry in North
    America. Historically, the Company has concentrated on the
    installation and distribution of insulation, which comprised
    approximately 15 percent of the Company’s consolidated
    net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004. Our offering of installed building products
    includes insulation, cabinetry, fireplaces, gutters and garage
    doors. Collaboration with other Company businesses has increased
    installed sales of Company products, such as cabinets, bath
    accessories, windows and paint. Distributed products include
    insulation, insulation accessories, cabinetry, roofing, gutters
    and drywall. Net sales of non-insulation products (both
    installed and distributed) in 2006 represented approximately
    41 percent of the segment’s net sales. Installed
    products are sold primarily to custom home builders and
    production home builders by over 280 installation branch
    locations throughout most of the United States and in Canada.
    Distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and
    dealers by over 60 distribution centers throughout the United
    States.

The Company’s competitors in this segment include several
    regional contractors and lumber yards, as well as numerous local
    contractors.

Decorative
    Architectural Products

The Company manufactures architectural coatings including
    paints, specialty paint products, stains, varnishes and
    waterproofing products. The products are sold under the brand
    names

and
    KILZ

®

and various other brand names, as well as private labels in the
    United States and Canada primarily to the
    “do-it-yourself” market through home centers and other
    retailers. Net sales of architectural coatings comprised
    approximately 11 percent of the Company’s consolidated
    net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. Competitors in the architectural
    coatings market include large international brands such as
    Benjamin Moore, Glidden, Pittsburgh Paint, Sherwin-Williams and
    Valspar, as well as many regional and national competitors.

The Company maintains customer kiosks in all of the
    approximately 2,000 The Home Depot stores throughout the United
    States and Canada. These COLOR
    SOLUTIONS

Discontinued
    Operations

As part of its strategic planning, the Company continues to
    review all of its businesses to determine which businesses may
    not be core to the Company’s long-term growth strategy. In
    2004, the Company determined that several European businesses
    were not core to the Company’s long-term growth strategy
    and, accordingly, embarked on a plan of disposition that was
    completed in early 2005. In addition, the Company sold two
    businesses in 2005 and one business in 2006. The businesses sold
    during 2004, 2005 and 2006 were included in discontinued
    operations and had combined 2004 net sales of approximately
    $640 million. Additional information is set forth in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” included in
    Item 7 of this Report.

Additional
    Information

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may
    affect our Company. These risks and uncertainties could cause
    future results to differ from past performance or expected
    results, including results described in statements elsewhere in
    this Report that constitute “forward-looking
    statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
    Act of 1995. The impact on our Company of certain of these risk
    factors is discussed below under Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.” Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently
    believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact our Company.
    Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events,
    these developments could have material adverse effects on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. These
    risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the
    following, which we consider to be most relevant to our specific
    business activities.

A significant
    portion of our business relies on residential construction
    activity.

Our results of operations are affected by levels of home
    improvement and residential construction activity, including
    repair, remodeling and new home construction, principally in
    North America and Europe. Significant factors that impact demand
    for home improvement and residential construction include
    interest rates, energy costs, consumer confidence, general and
    regional economic conditions, weather conditions and natural
    disasters. The ability of contractors and builders to supply
    construction projects and the timing of such projects, and
    thereby their purchases of our products and services, can be
    affected significantly by the availability of building materials
    and skilled labor. Demographic factors, such as changes in
    population growth and household formation, affect levels of home
    improvement and residential construction over the longer term.
    We have increased our emphasis on new product development in
    recent years and we have reduced our prior focus on growth
    through acquisitions and are concentrating instead on organic
    growth. Consequently, our financial performance will, in part,
    reflect our success in implementing our growth strategies in our
    existing markets and in introducing new products or entering new
    geographic markets. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
    under Item 7 of this Report for discussion of the impact of
    residential construction activities on the Company’s
    operating results.

We rely on key
    customers.

The size and importance of individual customers has increased
    because customers in our major distribution channels have
    consolidated. Larger customers can effect significant changes in
    their volume



of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the terms
    and conditions on which we do business. These customers are
    increasing their purchases of products directly from
    manufacturers for sale as private label and house brand
    merchandise. As some of our customers expand their markets and
    targeted customers, conflicts occur and in some instances we may
    also become their competitor. Sales of our home improvement and
    building products to home center retailers are substantial. In
    2006, sales to the Company’s largest customer, The Home
    Depot, were $2.5 billion (approximately 20 percent of
    net sales). Although builders, dealers and other retailers
    represent other channels of distribution for the Company’s
    products, the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to The
    Home Depot would have a material adverse impact on the Company.

We face
    significant competition in the U.S. and global
    markets.

The major markets for our products and services are highly
    competitive and in recent years global competition has increased
    significantly. Competition in home improvement and building
    product lines is based largely on performance, quality, brand
    reputation, style, delivery, customer service, exclusivity and
    price. Competition in the markets for our service businesses is
    based primarily on price, customer service, scope of
    capabilities, installation quality and financial strength.
    Although the relative importance of such factors varies between
    customers and among product categories, price is often a primary
    factor. Home center retailers, which have historically
    concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and small
    contractors, may in the future intensify their marketing efforts
    directly to professional homebuilders. Our ability to maintain
    our leadership positions in the markets we serve and to grow the
    businesses depends to a large extent upon our success in
    maintaining our relationships with major customers, managing our
    cost structure and introducing new products that appeal to
    changing consumer preferences.

Our operating
    results are affected by the cost and availability of labor and
    materials.

When we incur cost increases for raw materials, such as copper,
    brass and particle board, and for energy and other commodities,
    it may be difficult for us to completely offset the impact with
    price increases on a timely basis due to outstanding commitments
    to customers, competitive considerations and our customers’
    resistance to accepting such price increases. Some of our
    operations, including the Installation and Other Services
    segment, encounter shortages or unusual price increases in raw
    materials, including insulation,  from time to time. A
    substantial decrease in the availability of raw materials from
    suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could
    adversely impact our results of operations.

Although the availability of qualified employees is important
    throughout the entire Company, this is particularly applicable
    to our Installation and Other Services segment, because of its
    labor-intensive installation business. Significant changes in
    federal, state and local regulations addressing immigration and
    wages, as well as collective bargaining arrangements affecting
    wages and working conditions, could adversely affect the
    performance of our businesses.

International
    developments have an increasing impact on our
    business.

Over 17 percent of our sales are derived outside of North
    America (principally in Europe) and are transacted in currencies
    other than U.S. dollars (principally European euros and
    Great Britain pounds). Our international business faces risks
    associated with changes in political, monetary, economic and
    social environments, local labor conditions and practices, the
    laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, cultural
    differences and differences in enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights. U.S. laws affecting
    activities of U.S. companies abroad, including tax laws and
    laws regulating various business practices, also impact our
    international business. Our international operating results have
    been adversely influenced in the past when compared to our North
    American results, in part due to relative softness in the
    European markets and competitive pricing pressures on certain
    products.

Increasingly, we are sourcing products from outside North
    America, principally in Asia, and selling products in
    international markets. Differing international business
    practices, shipping and delivery requirements, and laws and
    regulations applicable to our business in these markets have
    raised the



complexity of managing our supply chain logistics and the
    potential for interruptions in our production scheduling.

Our operating results can fluctuate based on changes in currency
    exchange rates, which presents difficulty in comparing operating
    performance from period to period.

We have financial
    commitments and investments in financial assets, including
    assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial
    risk.

We have maintained investments in marketable securities and a
    number of private equity funds. Since there is no active trading
    market for investments in private equity funds, they are for the
    most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also
    have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including
    financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future
    changes in market conditions, the future performance of the
    underlying investments or new information provided by private
    equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such
    investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. In
    addition, we have commitments that require us to contribute
    additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of
    a capital call from the private equity fund.

Product liability
    claims and other litigation could be costly.

Increasingly, homebuilders, including our customers, are subject
    to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary
    course of their business. Our contractual commitments to these
    customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them
    against liability for the performance of our products or
    services or the performance of other products that we install.

We are also subject to product safety regulations, recalls and
    direct claims for product liability, including putative class
    actions. Product liability claims can result in significant
    liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly
    to defend. Also, we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to
    provide us with products or components for products we sell.
    Because we do not have direct control over the quality of such
    products, we are exposed to the risks relating to the quality of
    such products and to limitations on our recourse against such
    suppliers.

See Note T to the consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 of this Report for additional
    information about litigation involving our businesses.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The financial and business analysis below provides information
    which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and
    understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis
    should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
    statements and related notes.

The following discussion and certain other sections of this
    Report contain statements reflecting the Company’s views
    about its future performance and constitute
    “forward-looking statements” under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve
    risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and,
    accordingly, the Company’s actual results may differ
    materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking
    statements. Readers should consider that various factors,
    including those discussed in Item 1A “Risk
    Factors” of this Report, the “Executive
    Level Overview,” “Critical Accounting Policies
    and Estimates” and “Outlook for the Company”
    sections, may affect the Company’s performance. The Company
    undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
    statements as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise.

Executive
    Level Overview

The Company manufactures, distributes and installs home
    improvement and building products. These products are sold to
    the home improvement and home construction markets through mass
    merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, builders,
    distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors.

Factors that affect the Company’s results of operations
    include the levels of home improvement and residential
    construction activity principally in North America and Europe
    (including repair and remodeling and new home construction), the
    importance of and the Company’s relationships with key
    customers (including The Home Depot, which represented
    approximately 20 percent of the Company’s net sales in
    2006), the Company’s ability to maintain its leadership
    positions in its U.S. and global markets in the face of
    increasing competition, the Company’s ability to
    effectively manage its overall cost structure and the cost and
    availability of labor and materials. The Company’s
    international business faces political, monetary, economic and
    other risks that vary from country to country, as well as
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Further, the Company
    has financial commitments and investments in financial assets
    that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk.
    In addition, product liability claims and other litigation could
    be costly. These and other factors are discussed in more detail
    in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Report.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial
    condition and results of operations are based upon the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have
    been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
    these financial statements requires the Company to make certain
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. The Company regularly reviews its estimates and
    assumptions, which are based upon historical experience and
    various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
    the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

The Company believes that the following critical accounting
    policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates
    used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.



Revenue
    Recognition and Receivables

The Company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of
    loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered.
    The Company records revenue for unbilled services performed
    based upon estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and
    Other Services segment; such amounts are recorded in
    Receivables. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue
    for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special
    pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions
    and other volume-based incentives. Allowances for doubtful
    accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses
    resulting from the inability of customers to make required
    payments.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable
    inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of
    inventories and their estimated market value based upon
    assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an
    ongoing basis, the Company monitors these estimates and records
    adjustments for differences between estimates and actual
    experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly
    deviated from those determined using these estimates.

Financial
    Investments

The Company has maintained investments in marketable securities
    and a number of private equity funds, which aggregated
    $72 million and $211 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2006. Investments in marketable securities are
    carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses (that are
    deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect,
    through shareholders’ equity, as a component of other
    comprehensive income. The Company records an impairment charge
    to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in
    value that is deemed to be

other-than-temporary.

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for
    potential impairment when impairment indicators are present, or
    when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may
    have a significant adverse affect on the fair value of the
    investment. Impairment indicators the Company considers include
    the following: whether there has been a significant
    deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business
    prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory,
    economic or technological environment; a significant adverse
    change in the general market condition or geographic area in
    which the investment operates; and, any bona fide offers to
    purchase for less than the carrying value. Since there is no
    active trading market for these investments, they are for the
    most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also
    have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including
    financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future
    changes in market conditions, the future performance of the
    underlying investments or new information provided by private
    equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such
    investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation.

In November 2000, the Company reduced its common equity
    ownership in Metaldyne Corporation (“Metaldyne”)
    (formerly MascoTech, Inc.) through a recapitalization merger
    with an affiliate of Heartland Industrial Partners, L.P.
    (“Heartland”), a private equity fund in which the
    Company had a remaining investment of $17 million at
    December 31, 2006 (representing less than five percent of
    the fund). The Company in that transaction retained six percent
    of the common equity of Metaldyne. At December 31, 2006,
    the Company also held preferred stock of Metaldyne, which
    accrues dividends at the annual rate of 15 percent.
    Additionally, the Company owned an approximate 10 percent
    investment in TriMas Corporation (“TriMas”) common
    stock. Investments in Metaldyne and TriMas are accounted for on
    the cost basis.

During 2006, based upon a review of new information from the
    Heartland fund concerning fund investments and the continued
    deterioration of conditions in the automotive supplier and
    transportation products markets served by Metaldyne and TriMas,
    the Company determined that the decline in the estimated value
    of certain of its financial investments was

other-than-temporary.

Accordingly, in the



second quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a non-cash,
    pre-tax impairment charge aggregating $78 million for its
    investments in Metaldyne ($40 million), TriMas
    ($6 million), the Heartland fund ($29 million) and
    another fund ($3 million) which invested in automotive and
    transportation-related suppliers, including Metaldyne and
    TriMas. Additionally, based upon the Company’s review, the
    Company considered the decline in the fair value of certain of
    its other private equity fund investments and other investments
    to be

other-than-temporary

and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of
    $13 million and $15 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
    received new information related to its TriMas investment and
    determined that the additional decline in the estimated value
    for this investment was

other-than-temporary.

Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
    recognized an additional non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of
    $10 million related to its investment in TriMas.

On January 11, 2007, the acquisition of Metaldyne by Asahi
    Tec Corporation, a Japanese automotive supplier, was finalized.
    The combined fair value of Asahi Tec common and preferred stock
    received in exchange for the Company’s investment in
    Metaldyne (common and preferred stock) approximates
    $74 million and the Company’s carrying value of the
    Metaldyne investment was $57 million at December 31,
    2006. As a result, a gain of approximately $17 million will
    be recognized in the first quarter of 2007. Any unrealized gains
    or losses subsequent to January 11, 2007, will be
    recognized, net of tax, through shareholders’ equity, as a
    component of other comprehensive income, in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet beginning in the first quarter of
    2007.

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair
    value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill
    or other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
    in the fourth quarter of each year, or as an event occurs or
    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying
    amount, the Company completes the impairment testing of goodwill
    utilizing a discounted cash flow method. Determining market
    values using a discounted cash flow method requires the Company
    to make significant estimates and assumptions, including
    long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and
    appropriate discount rates. The Company’s judgments are
    based upon historical experience, current market trends,
    consultations with external valuation specialists and other
    information. While the Company believes that the estimates and
    assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable,
    different estimates and assumptions could result in a different
    outcome. In estimating future cash flows, the Company relies on
    internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating
    profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to
    three percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows
    for periods after the five-year forecast. The Company generally
    develops these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent
    sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product
    launches, estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling
    estimates for existing homes.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company estimated that future
    discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting
    business units were greater than the carrying values. Any
    increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no
    impact on the reported value of goodwill.

If the carrying amount of a reporting business unit exceeds its
    fair value, the Company measures the possible goodwill
    impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair
    value of the reporting business unit to all of the underlying
    assets and liabilities of the reporting business unit, including
    any previously unrecognized intangible assets. The excess of the
    fair value of a reporting business unit over the amounts
    assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value
    of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that
    a reporting business unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the
    implied fair value of goodwill. This test for 2006 indicated
    that goodwill principally related to certain European business
    units was impaired.



The Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for
    goodwill of $331 million ($331 million, after tax) in
    2006. The pre-tax impairment charges recorded in 2006 were as
    follows: Cabinets and Related Products – $316 million;
    Plumbing Products – $1 million; and Decorative
    Architectural Products – $14 million. These charges,
    principally related to the Company’s European manufacturer
    of

ready-to-assemble

cabinets (Tvilum-Scanbirk), reflect the long-term outlook for
    that business unit, including declining demand for certain
    products, as well as decreased operating profit margins.

The impairment charge for goodwill related to Tvilum-Scanbirk
    resulted from two significant changes impacting the business
    unit throughout the year, but particularly in the fourth quarter
    of 2006. First, there was a fundamental shift in the European

ready-to-assemble

raw materials supply market; the change affected the cost
    structure for raw materials. Second, the Company determined that
    the business unit’s ability to increase selling prices and
    maintain revenue growth into the future has become more limited.
    In the fourth quarter of 2006, as part of the annual goodwill
    impairment testing, the Company determined that these changes
    and the impact on operating profit and operating profit margins
    were permanent in nature.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances
    change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard
    to the reporting unit. The Company considers the implications of
    both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local
    economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales, profit
    margins and expected product growth) factors and their potential
    impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the
    near- and long-term.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the
    remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible
    assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and
    circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of
    amortization.

Employee
    Retirement Plans

Accounting for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating
    the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon
    vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the
    time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations
    of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent
    in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation,
    expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation
    increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses. The
    Company considers current market conditions, including changes
    in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in
    assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension
    costs and obligations within the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements in any given period.

In 2006, the Company increased its discount rate for obligations
    to an average of 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent. The
    discount rate for obligations was based on the expected duration
    of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities matched
    to the December 31, 2006 Citigroup Pension Discount Curve.
    Such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension plans
    ranged from 4.00 percent to 6.00 percent, with the
    most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount
    rate for obligations of 5.50 percent or higher. The assumed
    asset return was primarily 8.50 percent, reflecting the
    expected long-term return on plan assets.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R,”
    (“SFAS No. 158”). Among other things,
    SFAS No. 158 requires companies to prospectively
    recognize a net liability or asset and to report the funded
    status of their defined-benefit pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans on their balance sheets, with an offsetting
    adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income; such
    recognition did not affect the Company’s consolidated
    statements of income. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 was
    effective for the year ended December 31, 2006, and the
    effect was included in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet.



The Company’s underfunded amount for its qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans, the difference between the
    projected benefit obligation and plan assets, decreased to
    $186 million at December 31, 2006 from
    $231 million at December 31, 2005, primarily due to
    asset returns above projections; in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158, the 2006 unfunded amount has been
    recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2006. Qualified domestic pension plan assets
    in 2006 had a net return of approximately 11 percent equal
    to average returns of 11 percent for the largest 1,000 Plan
    Benchmark.

The Company’s projected benefit obligation for its unfunded
    non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans was
    $144 million at December 31, 2006 compared with
    $143 million at December 31, 2005; in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158, the 2006 unfunded amount has been
    recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2006.

The Company expects pension expense for its qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans to decrease by $9 million in
    2007 compared with 2006. If the Company assumed that the future
    return on plan assets was one-half percent lower than the
    assumed asset return, the 2007 pension expense would only
    decrease by $6 million. The Company expects pension expense
    for its non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans to decrease
    by $1 million in 2007 compared with 2006.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) replaced the 1991 Long Term Stock
    Incentive Plan (the “1991 Plan”) in May 2005 and
    provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various
    forms. At December 31, 2006, outstanding stock-based
    incentives were in the form of restricted long-term stock
    awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock
    appreciation rights. Additionally, the Company’s 1997
    Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (the “1997 Plan”)
    provides for the payment of part of the compensation to
    non-employee Directors in Company common stock.

The Company elected to begin recording expense for stock options
    granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2003.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,”
    (“SFAS No. 123R”) using the Modified
    Prospective Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method
    requires the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock
    options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through
    the remaining vesting periods. The MPA method does not require
    the restatement of prior-year information. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut
    method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
    options at December 31, 2006.

For 2006, the Company recognized additional pre-tax expense of
    $15 million ($9 million or $.02 per common share,
    after tax), related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.
    In addition, during 2006, the Company recognized expense of
    $3 million (net of income tax benefit of $2 million)
    as a cumulative effect of accounting change, net, related to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R and the change from the
    intrinsic value method to the fair value method of accounting
    for stock appreciation rights.

Restricted
    Long-Term Stock Awards

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and
    non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share
    dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of
    repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open
    market. There was $195 million (9 million common
    shares) of total unrecognized compensation expense related to
    unvested stock awards at December 31, 2006, which was
    included as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings.
    Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized
    ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock
    awards, typically 10 years (except for stock awards held by
    grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or
    the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible
    at age 65. For stock awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized over the
    vesting period of the stock awards, typically 10 years, or
    for executive grantees that are, or will become,
    retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the expense is
    being recognized over five years, or immediately upon a
    grantee’s retirement. Pre-tax compensation expense for the
    annual vesting of long-term stock awards was $52 million
    for 2006.



Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market
    price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date.
    These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over
    five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
    grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant
    date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration
    stock options, except for restoration options resulting from
    options granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration stock options
    become exercisable six months from the date of grant.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock options
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is
    being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of
    time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123.
    For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, such
    expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of
    the stock options, typically five years, or immediately upon a
    grantee’s retirement.

The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    assumptions for 2006: risk-free interest rate – 4.89%,
    dividend yield – 3.1%, volatility factor – 34.0% and
    expected option life – 7 years. For
    SFAS No. 123R calculation purposes, the weighted
    average grant date fair value of option shares, including
    restoration options, granted in 2006 was $8.24 per option
    share.

If the Company increased its assumptions for the risk-free
    interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the
    expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in
    2006 would increase 47 percent. If the Company decreased
    its assumptions for the risk-free interest rate and the
    volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the
    fair value of stock options granted in 2006 would decrease
    59 percent.

Income
    Taxes

The Company has considered potential sources of future foreign
    taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a
    valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets related to
    its after-tax foreign tax credit carryforward of
    $61 million at December 31, 2006. Should the Company
    determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of
    its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance
    would be recorded in the period such determination is made.

Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Certain of the Company’s products and product finishes and
    services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in
    material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to
    the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any
    changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
    servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted
    accordingly.

A significant portion of the Company’s business is at the
    consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers.
    A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
    warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not
    distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when
    they claim a return deduction from the Company. The
    Company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account
    this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are
    recorded at the time of sale.

The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims (including income taxes) with respect to matters
    generally arising in the ordinary course of business.
    Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require
    estimates and judgments based upon the professional knowledge
    and experience of



management and its legal counsel. When estimates of the
    Company’s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims meet the criteria for recognition under
    SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,”
    amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate
    resolution of any such exposure to the Company may differ due to
    subsequent developments. See Note T to the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements for information regarding
    certain legal proceedings involving the Company.

Corporate
    Development Strategy

In past years, acquisitions have enabled the Company to build
    strong positions in the markets it serves and have increased the
    Company’s importance to its customers. The Company’s
    focus includes the rationalization of its business units,
    including consolidations, as well as pursuing synergies among
    the Company’s business units. The Company expects to
    maintain a more balanced growth strategy with emphasis on
    organic growth, share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with
    increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital.
    As part of its strategic planning, the Company continues to
    review all of its businesses to determine which businesses may
    not be core to the Company’s long-term growth strategy.

In 2004, the Company determined that several European business
    units were not core to the Company’s long-term growth
    strategy and, accordingly, embarked on a plan of disposition
    (the “2004 Plan”). During 2004, in separate
    transactions, the Company completed the sale of its Jung Pumpen,
    The Alvic Group, Alma Kuchen, E. Missel and SKS Group business
    units in Europe. During 2005, in separate transactions, the
    Company completed the sale of its Gebhardt Consolidated, GMU
    Group and Aran Group business units in Europe, as well as its
    Zenith Products business unit in North America.

In 2006, the Company completed the sale of Computerized Security
    Systems (“CSS”). This disposition was completed
    pursuant to the Company’s determination that this business
    unit was not core to the Company’s long-term growth
    strategy. CSS supplies electronic locksets primarily to
    hospitality markets in the United States and Europe and was
    included in the Other Specialty Products segment. As a result of
    the sale, the Company reclassified the net sales and results of
    operations related to CSS to discontinued operations. Total
    gross proceeds from the sale were $92 million; the Company
    recognized a pre-tax net gain (included in discontinued
    operations) on the disposition of CSS of $51 million.

The sales, results of operations and the gains from the 2006,
    2005 and 2004 discontinued operations are included in income
    (loss) from discontinued operations, net, in the consolidated
    statements of income.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the
    Company accounted for the business units which were sold in
    2006, 2005 and 2004, except as noted below, as discontinued
    operations. There were no businesses held for sale at
    December 31, 2006.

During 2006, the Company completed the sale of Gamco Products,
    General Accessory, Cambridge Brass and Faucet Queens, relatively
    small businesses, the results of which are included in
    continuing operations through the date of sale. These businesses
    had combined net sales and operating profit of $16 million
    and $5 million, respectively, in 2006 through the
    respective dates of sale and combined net sales and operating
    profit of $55 million and $12 million, respectively,
    in 2005. Gross proceeds from the sale of these businesses were
    $72 million; the Company recognized a net gain of
    $1 million in 2006 included in other, net, in continuing
    operations.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through
    cash provided by a combination of its operations, long-term bank
    debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by
    the issuance of Company common stock, including issuances for
    certain mergers and acquisitions.

Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of
    funds. At December 31, 2006, the Company had a
    $2.0 billion

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of banks syndicated in
    the



United States and internationally, which expires in February
    2011. This agreement allows for borrowings denominated in
    U.S. dollars or European euros with interest payable based
    upon various floating-rate options as selected by the Company.

The

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, contains limitations on
    additional borrowings; at December 31, 2006, the Company
    had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of
    up to $1.7 billion. The

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, also contains a
    requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at
    December 31, 2006, the Company’s net worth exceeded
    such requirement by $1.1 billion.

At December 31, 2006, the amount of debt and equity
    securities issuable under the Company’s unallocated shelf
    registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission was $500 million.

The Company had cash and cash investments of $1,958 million
    at December 31, 2006 as a result of strong cash flows from
    operations, proceeds from the disposition of certain businesses
    and financial investments, and the issuance of fixed-rate debt.

The Company has maintained investments in marketable securities
    and a number of private equity funds, principally as part of its
    tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of
    tax capital losses, including significant capital losses
    resulting from the exit of certain businesses over the past
    several years. The Company determined that the longer maturity
    of private equity funds would be advantageous to the Company and
    complement the Company’s investment in more liquid,
    publicly traded marketable securities to balance risk. Since the
    Company has significantly reduced tax capital losses in part by
    generating capital gains from investments and other sources, the
    Company has and will continue to reduce its investments in
    financial assets.

In 2006, the Company increased its quarterly common stock
    dividend 10 percent to $.22 per common share. This
    marks the 48th consecutive year in which dividends have
    been increased.

Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the
    Company’s financial strategies. The Company’s total
    debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to
    53 percent at December 31, 2006 from 49 percent
    at December 31, 2005. On October 3, 2006, the Company
    issued $1 billion of fixed-rate 6.125% notes due 2016
    in anticipation of the 2007 debt maturities, including the put
    option related to the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes.
    Repurchases and retirement of Company common stock also
    contributed to the increase in the total debt to total
    capitalization ratio. The Company’s working capital ratio
    was 1.5 to 1 and 1.8 to 1 at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The decline in the working capital ratio is
    primarily due to the reclassification to current liabilities of
    $823 million of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes, as a
    result of the put option date of January 20, 2007,
    $300 million of floating-rate notes due March 2007 and
    $300 million of 4.625% notes due August 2007.

On January 20, 2007, holders of $1.8 billion
    (94 percent) principal amount at maturity of the Zero
    Coupon Convertible Senior Notes (“Notes”) required the
    Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash value of
    $825 million. As a result of this repurchase, a
    $93 million deferred income tax liability will be payable
    in June 2007. Subsequent to the repurchase, there were
    outstanding $108 million principal amount at maturity of
    such Notes with an accreted value of $51 million, which has
    been included in long-term debt at December 31, 2006, as
    the next put option date is July 20, 2011. The Company may,
    at any time on or after January 25, 2007, redeem all or
    part of the Notes at their accreted value.

The derivatives used by the Company during 2006 consist of
    interest rate swaps entered into in 2004, for the purpose of
    effectively converting a portion of fixed-rate debt to
    variable-rate debt. Generally, under interest rate swap
    agreements, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange
    the difference between fixed-rate and variable-rate interest
    amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal
    amount. The derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy
    institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. The
    interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair-value
    hedges, and the interest rate differential on interest rate
    swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment
    to interest expense over the term of the agreement. For
    fair-value hedge transactions,



changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the
    fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining
    earnings.

The average variable interest rates are based upon the London
    Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus fixed adjustment
    factors. The average effective rate for 2006 on the interest
    rate swaps was 6.787%. At December 31, 2006, the interest
    rate swap agreements covered a notional amount of
    $850 million of the Company’s fixed-rate debt due
    July 15, 2012 at an interest rate of 5.875%. The hedges are
    considered 100 percent effective because all of the
    critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match
    those of the hedged item. Accordingly, no gain or loss on the
    value of the hedges was recognized in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of income for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. In 2006, the Company recognized
    an increase in interest expense of $8 million related to
    this swap agreement, due to increasing interest rates.

Certain of the Company’s European operations also entered
    into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of
    managing exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to
    the European euro and the Great Britain pound.

The Company’s cash and cash investments decreased
    $6 million to $1,958 million at December 31,
    2006, from $1,964 million at December 31, 2005.

Net cash provided by operations of $1.2 billion consisted
    primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash and certain other
    items, including depreciation and amortization expense of
    $244 million, net gain on disposition of businesses of
    $51 million, net gain on disposition of financial
    investments of $31 million, a $331 million charge for
    the impairment of goodwill, a $101 million charge for the
    impairment of financial investments and other non-cash items,
    including stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense
    related to in-store displays and interest expense on the Zero
    Coupon Convertible Senior Notes, as well as a net increase in
    working capital of $57 million.

The Company continues to emphasize balance sheet management,
    including working capital management and cash flow generation.
    Days sales in accounts receivable were 50 days at
    December 31, 2006 compared with 48 days at
    December 31, 2005, and days sales in inventories were
    49 days at



December 31, 2006 compared with 46 days at
    December 31, 2005. Accounts payable days improved to
    39 days from 36 days at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Working capital (defined as accounts
    receivable and inventories less accounts payable) as a percent
    of sales was 16.1 percent and 15.9 percent at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Net cash used for financing activities was $1.0 billion,
    and included cash outflows of $349 million for cash
    dividends paid, $827 million for the retirement of notes
    and $854 million for the acquisition and retirement of
    29 million shares of Company common stock in open-market
    transactions. Cash provided by financing activities primarily
    included $988 million from the issuance of notes (net of
    issuance costs) and $28 million from the issuance of
    Company common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock
    options.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had remaining Board of
    Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to an additional
    36 million shares of its common stock in open-market
    transactions or otherwise. In January 2007, the Company
    repurchased an additional one million shares of Company common
    stock and expects to continue its share repurchase program
    throughout 2007.

Net cash used for investing activities was $226 million,
    and included $388 million for capital expenditures and
    $28 million for acquisitions. Cash provided by investing
    activities included $160 million of net proceeds from the
    disposition of businesses and $71 million from the net sale
    of financial investments.

The Company continues to invest in automating its manufacturing
    operations and increasing its capacity and its productivity to
    more efficiently produce and to improve customer service.
    Capital expenditures for 2006 were $388 million, compared
    with $282 million for 2005 and $310 million for 2004;
    for 2007, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2007
    acquisitions, are expected to approximate $300 million.
    Depreciation and amortization expense for 2006 totaled
    $244 million, compared with $241 million for 2005 and
    $237 million for 2004; for 2007, depreciation and
    amortization expense, excluding any potential 2007 acquisitions,
    is expected to approximate $255 million. Amortization
    expense totaled $14 million, $28 million and
    $26 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with
    existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor in
    the opinion of the Company are they expected to have, a material
    effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, financial
    position or results of operations.

The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash
    flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near-term
    working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes
    that its longer-term working capital and other general corporate
    requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from
    operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings,
    future financial market activities and proceeds from asset sales.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in
    the United States. However, the Company believes that certain
    non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the
    business may provide users of this financial information with
    additional meaningful comparisons between current results and
    results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and
    ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an
    alternative for, the Company’s reported results.

Sales and
    Operations

Net sales for 2006 were $12.8 billion, representing an
    increase of two percent over 2005. Excluding results from
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales
    increased one percent compared



with 2005. The following table reconciles reported net sales to
    net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency

Net sales for 2006 were adversely affected by an accelerating
    decline in the new home construction market in the last six
    months of the year and a moderation in consumer spending for
    certain “big ticket” home improvement items, such as
    cabinets, partially offset by selling price increases.

The Company’s gross profit margins were 27.5 percent,
    28.5 percent and 30.9 percent in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The decrease in the 2006 and 2005 gross profit
    margins reflects additional increased commodity, energy and
    freight costs, as well as a less favorable product mix, offset
    in part by increased selling prices for certain products. The
    2004 gross profit margins reflected increased sales volume and
    increased selling prices, offset in part by initial increases in
    commodity costs, as well as sales in segments with somewhat
    lower gross margins.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
    sales were 16.1 percent in 2006 compared with
    15.5 percent in 2005 and 16.8 percent in 2004.
    Increased selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006
    reflect increased stock-based compensation expense, in part
    reflecting the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and
    increased information systems implementation costs and other
    expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005
    reflect lower compensation costs resulting from business unit
    consolidations and reduced Company financial performance related
    to incentive compensation, as well as reduced outside
    professional fees including fees associated with complying with
    Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. Selling, general and administrative
    expenses in 2004 include the benefit of lower promotion and
    advertising costs offset by higher costs and expenses associated
    with complying with Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and increased
    expenses associated with stock options.

Operating profit in 2006 and 2005 includes $47 million and
    $12 million, respectively, of costs and charges related to
    the Company’s profit improvement programs, principally in
    the Plumbing Products segment. Operating profit in 2006, 2005
    and 2004 includes $331 million, $69 million and
    $112 million, respectively, of impairment charges for
    goodwill. Operating profit in 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes
    $1 million, $6 million and $30 million,
    respectively, of income regarding the Behr litigation
    settlement. Operating profit margins, as reported, were
    8.8 percent, 12.5 percent and 13.4 percent in
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating profit margins,
    excluding the items above, were 11.8 percent,
    13.1 percent and 14.1 percent in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively
    affected by an accelerating decline in the new home construction
    market and a moderation in consumer spending for certain
    “big ticket” home improvement items, such as cabinets,
    in the last half of 2006, both of which negatively impacted the
    sales volume of certain products, as well as the continuing
    negative impact of higher commodity costs. These items were
    partially offset by certain selling price increases. Operating
    profit margins in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased
    commodity, energy, freight and other petroleum-based product
    costs, which had only been partially offset by selling price
    increases. Operating profit margins in 2004 were positively
    affected by increased sales volume, partially offset by
    increased commodity costs.

Other Income
    (Expense), Net

During 2006, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges aggregating $88 million for its investments related
    to Metaldyne ($40 million), TriMas ($16 million), the
    Heartland fund



($29 million) and another fund ($3 million) which
    invested in automotive and transportation-related suppliers,
    including Metaldyne and TriMas. Additionally, during 2006, based
    upon the Company’s review, the Company considered the
    decline in the fair value of certain of its other private equity
    fund investments and other investments to be

other-than-temporary

and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of
    $13 million.

Other, net, for 2006 included $4 million of realized gains,
    net, from the sale of marketable securities, $10 million of
    dividend income and $27 million of income from other
    investments, net. Other, net, for 2006 also included currency
    transaction gains of $14 million and other miscellaneous
    items.

During 2005, the Company recognized an impairment charge of
    $30 million primarily related to its investment in
    Furniture Brands International common stock. Also during 2005,
    based upon the Company’s review of its private equity
    funds, the Company considered the decline in the fair value of
    certain of its private equity fund investments to be

other-than-temporary

and, accordingly, recognized an impairment charge of
    $15 million.

Other, net, for 2005 included $30 million of realized
    gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities,
    $16 million of dividend income and $68 million of
    income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2005 also
    included currency transaction losses of $25 million and
    other miscellaneous items.

During 2004, the Company recognized an impairment charge of
    $21 million related to its investment in Furniture Brands
    International common stock.

Other, net, for 2004 included $50 million of realized
    gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities,
    $27 million of dividend income and $42 million of
    income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2004 also
    included currency transaction gains of $26 million and
    other miscellaneous items.

Interest expense was $240 million, $247 million and
    $217 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily the result of
    the repayment of $800 million of 6.75% notes in March
    2006, partially offset by the issuance of $1 billion of
    6.125% notes in October 2006, as well as the impact of
    increasing interest rates. The increase in interest expense in
    2005 is primarily due to the issuance of fixed-rate notes in
    June 2005, as well as the impact of increasing interest rates.

Income and
    Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing
    Operations

Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing
    operations for 2006 were $461 million and $1.15 per
    common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations
    for 2006 included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for
    goodwill of $331 million ($331 million or
    $.83 per common share, after tax). Income and diluted
    earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2005
    were $866 million and $2.01 per common share,
    respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2005
    included non-cash,

pre-tax

impairment charges for goodwill of $69 million
    ($69 million or $.16 per common share, after tax) and
    income regarding the litigation settlement of $6 million
    pre-tax ($4 million or $.01 per common share, after
    tax). Income and diluted earnings per common share from
    continuing operations for 2004 were $944 million and $2.07
    per common share, respectively. Income from continuing
    operations for 2004 included non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges for goodwill of $112 million ($104 million or
    $.23 per common share, after tax) and income regarding the
    litigation settlement of $30 million pre-tax
    ($19 million or $.04 per common share, after tax).

The Company’s effective tax rate for income from continuing
    operations was 46 percent in 2006 and 37 percent in
    both 2005 and 2004. The increased effective tax rate in 2006 is
    primarily due to an increase in impairment charges for goodwill
    not being deductible for tax purposes. The Company estimates
    that its effective tax rate should approximate 35 to
    36 percent for 2007.



Outlook for the
    Company

The Company’s 2006 results were adversely affected by an
    accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a
    moderation in consumer spending for certain “big
    ticket” home improvement items, such as cabinets, and the
    continuing negative impact of higher commodity costs, partially
    offset by profit improvement programs and selling price
    increases.

New home construction has declined dramatically in the last
    12 months due to previous excessive speculative buying,
    rapidly rising home prices in recent years reducing the
    affordability and less attractive mortgage terms. Housing starts
    declined by 13 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 to
    approximately 1.8 million units. Late in 2006, housing
    starts declined even further to an annual run rate of
    approximately 1.5 million to 1.6 million units, which
    is more than 20 percent below the 2005 levels. Even with
    the recent decline in single-family housing starts, the
    inventory of unsold new homes has increased to unprecedented
    levels.

The Company is proactively managing its business for the current
    difficult economic times in our markets by pursuing a variety of
    initiatives to further reduce costs and improve operating
    profits. Initiatives already started include headcount
    reductions, sourcing programs, restructuring of certain
    businesses including consolidations, manufacturing
    rationalization and other profit improvement programs. While the
    Company’s earnings outlook for 2007 incudes costs related
    to these initiatives, as well as start-up costs related to plant
    capacity additions, system implementation costs, higher interest
    expense and as yet unrecovered commodity cost increases, the
    Company believes that implementing these initiatives should
    improve the Company’s earnings outlook for 2008 and beyond.

The Company remains committed to its long-term growth strategy,
    concentrating on organic sales growth, improving return on
    invested capital and generating significant returns to
    shareholders. We continue to drive our growth initiatives,
    including leveraging installation services, developing new
    channels of distribution, pursuing new markets in emerging
    economies and emphasizing new product development.

Business Segment
    Results Discussion

Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business
    Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general
    corporate expense, net, gains on sale of corporate fixed assets,
    net, income regarding the litigation settlement, and impairment
    charges for goodwill in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Profit
    Improvement Programs

As part of its profit improvement programs, the Company has been
    focused on the rationalization of its Plumbing Products segment.
    As a result, in 2005, the Company incurred approximately
    $12 million pre-tax of charges related to headcount
    reductions and the discontinuance of a product line. In
    addition, the Company announced a plant closure in the Plumbing
    Products segment in January 2006. During 2006, the Company
    incurred $39 million pre-tax of costs and charges
    (primarily accelerated depreciation and severance expense)
    related to this plant closure and other profit improvement
    programs in the Plumbing Products segment.

The Company originally estimated that costs and charges for
    profit improvement programs related to its Plumbing Products
    segment would approximate $70 million pre-tax compared with
    the actual charges of $39 million pre-tax. The reduced
    amount reflects the fourth quarter sale of a manufacturing
    facility in the Plumbing Products segment which was originally
    planned for closure.

In addition, in 2006, the Company incurred $8 million
    pre-tax of costs and charges (including the write-down of
    inventories and accelerated depreciation) related to the closure
    of a relatively small

ready-to-assemble

cabinet manufacturing facility in the Cabinets and Related
    Products segment.

Cabinets and
    Related Products

Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased in 2006
    primarily due to lower sales of

ready-to-assemble

cabinets in North American and Europe, which more than offset
    certain selling price increases and sales volume increases of
    assembled cabinets in North America in the first half of 2006. A
    weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 also had a positive effect on
    the translation of local currencies of European operations
    included in this segment. The 2005 sales increases in this
    segment were primarily attributable to increased sales volume in
    the new construction market, as well as certain selling price
    increases.

The operating profit margins in this segment include the
    negative effect of $8 million of costs and charges related
    to the closure of a relatively small

ready-to-assemble

cabinet manufacturing facility in 2006. Excluding such charges,
    the operating profit margin was 13.6 percent in 2006.
    Operating profit margins in this segment were negatively
    affected by a decline in sales volume in the last half of 2006,
    as well as increased commodity, freight and plant

start-up

costs, offset in part by selling price increases. Operating
    profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by
    lower European operating results, particularly due to lower
    sales volume of ready-to-assemble cabinets and increased
    commodity costs. Operating profit margins in 2005 reflect
    increased commodity and freight costs and manufacturing and
    distribution inefficiencies in North America, as well as a shift
    to a less favorable product mix, which offset the positive
    impact of higher unit sales volume. Operating profit margins in
    2004 reflect the positive impact of higher unit sales volume, as
    well as certain profit improvement initiatives.

Plumbing
    Products

Net sales of Plumbing Products increased in 2006 primarily due
    to increased sales volume of certain European operations, as
    well as increased sales volume through the Company’s North
    American wholesale distribution channel. These results were
    offset in part by declining sales volume to certain retail
    customers. A weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 also had a positive
    effect on the translation of local currencies of European
    operations included in this segment. Net sales of Plumbing
    Products increased in 2005 principally due to increased sales
    through the Company’s wholesale distribution channel and
    the increased sales of certain European operations included in
    this segment.



The operating profit margins in this segment were adversely
    affected by costs and charges aggregating $39 million and
    $12 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to
    certain profit improvement initiatives; excluding such charges,
    operating profit margins in this segment would have been
    9.7 percent and 12.2 percent in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2006
    were negatively affected by increased commodity costs, as well
    as a less favorable product mix and declining sales volume to
    certain retail customers. The operating profit margins in 2005
    were adversely affected by increased commodity costs, which were
    not offset by selling price increases and a less favorable
    product mix, which more than offset increased sales volume in
    the wholesale distribution channel. The operating profit margins
    in 2004 reflect an increase in European sales, as well as
    increased material costs and an increase in sales volume.

The Company’s Plumbing Products segment continues to be
    negatively impacted by import competition, as well as a product
    mix shift towards lower-margin faucets within the North American
    retail channels. As part of the Company’s strategic review
    of its businesses, the Company determined that in order to
    remain competitive, it is necessary to increase off-shore
    sourcing at lower costs, while consolidating and reducing
    manufacturing operations in North America. Consistent with this
    determination, in January 2006, the Company announced a North
    American plant closure in this segment; costs associated with
    this plant closure are included in the profit improvement costs
    above.

Installation
    and Other Services

Net sales of Installation and Other Services increased in 2006
    primarily due to increased sales volume of non-insulation
    products and selling price increases in the first half of 2006.
    However, the continued slowdown in the new home construction
    market significantly reduced sales in the second half of 2006
    compared with 2005, particularly in the fourth quarter. Net
    sales in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to
    increased selling prices, as well as increased sales volume of
    non-insulation products and continued strength in the new home
    construction market.

The 2006 operating profit margin decline in this segment was
    primarily attributable to increased sales volume of generally
    lower-margin, non-insulation products, as well as increased
    operating costs to support the segment’s continued growth
    in non-insulation products, new product development and
    technology initiatives. The slight decline in operating profit
    margins in 2005 was primarily attributable to continued
    increases in sales of generally lower-margin, non-insulation
    products, as well as the time lag in implementing selling price
    increases related to material cost increases, partially offset
    by the favorable impact of higher sales volume. The decline in
    operating profit margins in 2004 reflect an increase in sales of
    non-insulation products.

While the Company experienced constrained availability of
    fiberglass insulation through the first half of 2006 due to
    planned availability programs implemented by its vendors, the
    continued slowdown in new residential construction has now
    resulted in fiberglass insulation becoming readily available to
    the Company. At the current time, the Company believes that it
    will be able to source adequate quantities of insulation
    materials to meet its needs during 2007.

Decorative
    Architectural Products

Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased in 2006
    primarily due to selling price increases of paints and stains.
    Net sales in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to
    increased sales volume for paints and stains.

The operating profit margins in this segment improved in 2006
    due to increased selling prices of paints and stains, which
    partially offset commodity cost increases experienced in late
    2004 and during 2005. The operating profit margins in this
    segment in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased material
    and freight costs, which were not completely offset by increased
    selling prices related to paints and stains. The operating
    profit margins in 2004 include the effect of increased sales
    volume of paints and stains and increased sales volume and
    improved operating performance of the Company’s decorative
    hardware businesses, offset in part by increased material and
    promotion costs.



Other
    Specialty Products

Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased in 2006
    principally due to lower sales volume of windows and doors,
    resulting from a slowdown in the new home construction market,
    particularly in the Western United States. A weaker
    U.S. dollar in 2006 had a positive effect on the
    translation of local currencies of European operations included
    in this segment. Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased
    in 2005 principally due to increased sales volume and certain
    selling price increases of doors and windows to the North
    American new home construction markets, which were partially
    offset by reduced sales of European operations included in this
    segment.

The operating profit margins in this segment declined in 2006
    due to lower sales volume of windows and doors, which offset
    improved European operating results. Operating profit margins in
    this segment in 2005 were negatively affected by increased
    commodity costs and the lower results of European operations,
    reflecting charges related to profit improvement initiatives,
    offset in part by reduced state use tax expense. The operating
    profit margins in 2004 were primarily attributable to increased
    sales volume of windows.

Geographic Area
    Results Discussion

North
    America

Net sales from North American operations increased slightly in
    2006 benefiting from relatively stronger market conditions in
    the first half of 2006, as well as increased selling prices. An
    accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a
    moderation in consumer spending reduced sales volume in the
    second half of 2006 particularly for assembled cabinets, windows
    and doors and sales of insulation products. Net sales from North
    American operations increased in 2005 primarily due to strength
    in the new home construction market and increased sales volume
    of cabinets, installation sales of insulation and non-insulation
    products, and sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio
    doors, as well as increased selling prices for certain products.

Operating profit margins include charges related to the
    Company’s profit improvement programs, principally in the
    Plumbing Products segment, of $45 million and
    $12 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding such
    charges, operating profit margins from North American operations
    were 14.0 percent and 15.1 percent in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The operating profit margin decline in North
    American operations is primarily due to sales volume declines in
    the second half of 2006 of

ready-to-assemble

cabinets, windows and doors and the installation of insulation
    products, as well as increased commodity costs, partially offset
    by selling price increases. Operating profit margins in 2005
    were negatively impacted by continued increases in commodity,
    energy, freight and other petroleum-based product costs, which
    were only partially offset by selling price increases, and
    increased sales volume of cabinets, installation services and
    windows and patio doors to the new home construction market.
    Operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by
    increases in sales volume of assembled cabinets, faucets, paints
    and stains, vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors and
    installed sales of insulation and non-insulation products.
    Operating profit margins in 2004 were negatively impacted by
    increased commodity costs, which offset lower sales promotion
    costs.

International,
    Principally Europe

Net sales from International operations increased in 2006
    primarily due to increased sales of plumbing products, which
    more than offset lower sales volume of

ready-to-assemble

cabinets. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the
    translation of European results in 2006, increasing European net
    sales in 2006 by one percent. Net sales from International
    operations increased in 2005 primarily due to increased local
    currency sales of exported plumbing products and

ready-to-assemble

cabinets, offset in part by declining sales of windows and other
    plumbing products.

Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by the
    lower operating results for European

ready-to-assemble

cabinets, which more than offset the positive effect of
    increased sales



volume of plumbing products and improved operating results of
    other European operations. Operating profit margins in 2005 were
    negatively affected by increased commodity costs and costs
    associated with certain profit improvement initiatives, as well
    as a less favorable product mix. Operating profit margins in
    2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of
    plumbing products,

ready-to-assemble

cabinets and windows.

    Matters

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

Information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company is
    set forth in Note T to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Other
    Commitments

With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity
    funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2006, commitments
    to contribute up to $60 million of additional capital to
    such funds, representing the Company’s aggregate capital
    commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to
    date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional
    capital contributions to its private equity funds upon receipt
    of a capital call from the private equity fund. The Company has
    no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital
    calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in
    the carrying value of the Company’s investment in the
    private equity fund when paid.

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and
    customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries
    in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims made
    against builders by homeowners for issues relating to the
    Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with
    divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally
    provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to
    various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks;
    legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns;
    and asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a
    material amount related to these indemnifications, and evaluates
    the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately
    records an estimated liability when probable.

Recently Issued
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission
    released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    “Quantifying Financial Statement Misstatements,”
    (“SAB 108”). Historically, the Company evaluated
    financial statement misstatements using an
    “iron-curtain” method, which primarily focused on the
    effect of correcting the period-end balance sheet with less
    emphasis on the reversing effects of prior-year errors on the
    statement of income. SAB 108 clarified that the evaluation
    of financial statement misstatements must be made based upon all
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors; this is referred
    to as a “dual approach.” SAB 108 is effective for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have an effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,”
    (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 is effective January 1,
    2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the
    provisions of SFAS No. 157 will have on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement 109,”
    (“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48 allows
    the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a
    greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon
    examination by the taxing authorities. FIN No. 48 also
    provides guidance on classification, interest and



penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition. The adoption of FIN No. 48 is effective
    January 1, 2007.

Historically, the Company has established reserves for tax
    contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,”
    (“SFAS No. 5”). Under this standard,
    reserves for tax contingencies are established when it is
    probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 48 establishes a
    lower threshold for recognizing reserves for income tax
    contingencies on uncertain tax positions than the thresholds
    under SFAS No. 5. Therefore, although the Company has
    not completed its evaluation of the impact of
    FIN No. 48 on its consolidated financial statements,
    it currently estimates that its reserves for income tax
    contingencies net of any federal tax benefit will increase by
    approximately $25 million to $45 million, as of the
    date of adoption. The cumulative effect of applying
    FIN No. 48 will be recorded as a reduction to
    beginning retained earnings in 2007. The Company believes that,
    in future years, there will be a greater potential for
    volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower
    threshold allows changes in the income tax environment to affect
    the tax reserve computation to a greater degree than
    SFAS No. 5.

In addition, the Company expects to reclassify the majority of
    its reserves for income tax contingencies from current to
    non-current liabilities in accordance with the provisions of
    FIN No. 48.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting
    Release No. 48, “Disclosure of Accounting Policies for
    Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity
    Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative
    Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial
    Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative
    Commodity Instruments.”

The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest
    rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course
    of business and to market price fluctuations related to its
    marketable securities and other investments. The Company has
    limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and
    uses such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure
    to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency
    fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information regarding the
    Company’s derivative instruments.

The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 consist of interest rate swap agreements
    entered into in 2004 for the purpose of effectively converting a
    portion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The Company,
    including certain European operations, also entered into foreign
    currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency
    fluctuations related primarily to the European euro and the
    Great Britain pound.

At December 31, 2006, the Company performed sensitivity
    analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of
    market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical
    change of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a
    10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a
    10 percent decline in the market value of the
    Company’s long-term investments. Based upon the analyses
    performed, such changes would not be expected to materially
    affect the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Masco Corporation is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Masco Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

The management of Masco Corporation assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 using the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in “Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework.” Based on this assessment, management has
    determined that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of Masco
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which expressed
    unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and the
    effectiveness of Masco Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. Additionally,
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the Company’s 2006 consolidated financial statements. This
    report appears under Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data under the heading Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Masco Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of Masco Corporation’s
    consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
    audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Masco
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note M to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    stock-based compensation in 2006. In addition, as discussed in
    Note N to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans effective
    December 31, 2006.

Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 8, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and



performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
    consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations
    of variable interest entities, for which the Company is the
    primary beneficiary, in accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 46 – Revised, “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities.”

Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of
    Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to
    make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
    these estimates and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue
    as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to
    customers or when services are rendered, net of applicable
    provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. The Company
    records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon
    estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other
    Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables.
    Amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in net
    sales, while costs incurred for shipping and handling are
    included in cost of sales.

Customer Promotion Costs.

The Company records
    estimated reductions to revenue for customer program and
    incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative
    advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based
    incentives. In-store displays that are owned by the Company and
    used to market the Company’s products are included in other
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized
    using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of
    three years; related amortization expense is classified as a
    selling expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Foreign Currency.

The financial statements of the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local
    currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
    these subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates as of the
    balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at
    average exchange rates in effect during the year. The resulting
    cumulative translation adjustments have been recorded in the
    other comprehensive income component of shareholders’
    equity. Realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses
    are included in the consolidated statements of income in other
    income (expense), net.

Cash and Cash Investments.

The Company considers all
    highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three
    months or less to be cash and cash investments.

Receivables.

The Company does significant
    business with a number of customers, including certain home
    centers. The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and
    records related allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are
    estimated based upon specific customer balances, where a risk of
    default has been identified, and also include a provision for
    non-customer specific defaults based upon historical collection,
    return and write-off activity. A separate allowance is recorded
    for customer incentive rebates and is generally based upon sales
    activity. Receivables are presented net of certain allowances
    (including allowances for doubtful accounts) of $84 million
    and $78 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Receivables include unbilled revenue related to
    the Installation and Other Services segment of $40 million
    and $57 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment,
    including significant betterments to existing facilities, are
    recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal, the cost and
    accumulated depreciation

    POLICIES – (Continued)

are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included
    in the consolidated statements of income. Maintenance and repair
    costs are charged against earnings as incurred.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense is computed
    principally using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets. Annual depreciation rates are as
    follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10 percent,
    and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation
    expense was $230 million, $208 million and
    $204 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” requires
    goodwill and other intangible assets to be tested for impairment
    annually and under certain circumstances. The Company performs
    such testing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or
    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying
    amount. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting
    business units to the carrying value of the reporting business
    units for goodwill impairment testing. Fair value is determined
    using a discounted cash flow method.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances
    change that indicate the assets may be impaired. The Company
    considers the implications of both external (e.g., market
    growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal
    (e.g., product sales, profit margins and expected product
    growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related
    to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using
    the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The
    Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable
    identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to
    determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to
    the remaining periods of amortization. See Note H for
    additional information regarding Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Derivative
    Instruments.

The carrying value of financial
    instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets for
    current assets, current liabilities and long-term floating-rate
    debt approximates fair value. The fair value of financial
    instruments that are carried as non-current investments is based
    principally upon information from investment fund managers and
    other assumptions, on quoted market prices for those or similar
    investments, by estimating the fair value of consideration to be
    received or by discounting future cash flows using a discount
    rate that reflects the risk of the underlying investments. The
    fair value of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate debt
    instruments is based principally upon quoted market prices for
    the same or similar issues or the current rates available to the
    Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
    The aggregate market value of non-current investments and
    long-term debt at December 31, 2006 was approximately
    $246 million and $3,616 million, compared with the
    aggregate carrying value of $246 million and
    $3,533 million, respectively. The aggregate market value of
    non-current investments and long-term debt at December 31,
    2005 was approximately $367 million and
    $3,654 million, compared with the aggregate carrying value
    of $395 million and $3,915 million, respectively.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage
    certain exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows
    resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
    interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability
    measured at fair value. For each derivative instrument that is
    designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss
    on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or
    gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are
    recognized in determining current earnings during the period of
    the change in fair values. For derivative instruments not
    designated as hedging instruments,

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Continued)

the gain or loss is recognized in determining current earnings
    during the period of the change in fair value.

Warranty.

At the time of sale, the Company accrues a
    warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products,
    parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction
    of warranty obligations. The Company’s estimate of costs to
    service its warranty obligations is based upon historical
    experience and expectations of future conditions.

A significant portion of the Company’s business is at the
    consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers.
    A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
    warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not
    distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when
    they claim a return deduction from the Company. The
    Company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account
    this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are
    recorded at the time of sale.

Product Liability.

The Company provides for expenses
    associated with product liability obligations when such amounts
    are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are
    adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change
    that would effect the estimated liability.

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company elected to
    change its method of accounting for stock-based compensation and
    implemented the fair value method prescribed by
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation,” effective January 1, 2003. The Company
    used the prospective method, as defined by
    SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation – Transition and Disclosure –
    an amendment to SFAS No. 123,” for determining
    stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, options granted,
    modified or settled subsequent to January 1, 2003 were
    accounted for using the fair value method, and options granted
    prior to January 1, 2003 were accounted for using the
    intrinsic value method.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,”
    (“SFAS No. 123R”) using the Modified
    Prospective Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method
    requires the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock
    options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through
    the remaining vesting periods. The MPA method does not require
    the restatement of prior-year information. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut
    method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
    options at December 31, 2006.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior-year amounts have

    consolidated financial statements. The results of operations
    related to 2006, 2005 and 2004 discontinued operations have been
    reclassified and separately stated in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income for 2006, 2005 and 2004. In
    the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, the
    cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately
    classified.

Other Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In
    September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission released
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Quantifying
    Financial Statement Misstatements,”
    (“SAB 108”). Historically, the Company evaluated
    financial statement misstatements using an
    “iron-curtain” method, which primarily focused on the
    effect of correcting the period-end balance sheet with less
    emphasis on the reversing effects of prior-year errors on the
    statement of income. SAB 108 clarified that the evaluation
    of financial statement misstatements must be made based upon all
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors; this is referred
    to as a “dual approach.” SAB 108 is effective for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have an effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,”
    (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 is effective January 1,
    2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the
    provisions of SFAS No. 157 will have on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement 109,”
    (“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48 allows
    the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a
    greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon
    examination by the taxing authorities. FIN No. 48 also
    provides guidance on classification, interest and



MASCO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Concluded)

penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition. The adoption of FIN No. 48 is effective
    January 1, 2007.

Historically, the Company has established reserves for tax
    contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,”
    (“SFAS No. 5”). Under this standard,
    reserves for tax contingencies are established when it is
    probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 48 establishes a
    lower threshold for recognizing reserves for income tax
    contingencies on uncertain tax positions than the thresholds
    under SFAS No. 5. Therefore, although the Company has
    not completed its evaluation of the impact of
    FIN No. 48 on its consolidated financial statements,
    it currently estimates that its reserves for income tax
    contingencies net of any federal tax benefit will increase by
    approximately $25 million to $45 million, as of the
    date of adoption. The cumulative effect of applying
    FIN No. 48 will be recorded as a reduction to
    beginning retained earnings in 2007. The Company believes that,
    in future years, there will be a greater potential for
    volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower
    threshold allows changes in the income tax environment to affect
    the tax reserve computation to a greater degree than
    SFAS No. 5.

In addition, the Company expects to reclassify the majority of
    its reserves for income tax contingencies from current to
    non-current liabilities in accordance with the provisions of
    FIN No. 48.

B.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
    (“SFAS No. 144”) addresses the accounting
    and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
    assets. SFAS No. 144 broadens the presentation of
    discontinued operations to include a component of the Company,
    which comprises operations and cash flows, that can be clearly
    distinguished from the rest of the Company. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, the Company has accounted for the
    business units which were sold in 2006, 2005 and 2004, except as
    noted, as discontinued operations.

In 2004, the Company determined that several European business
    units were not core to the Company’s long-term growth
    strategy and, accordingly, embarked on a plan of disposition
    (the “2004 Plan”). The discontinued operations were
    previously included in each of the Company’s segments,
    except the Installation and Other Services segment. In 2004, the
    Company recognized pre-tax charges of $139 million
    ($151 million including tax effect) for those European
    business units that were expected to be divested at a loss. Any
    gains resulting from the dispositions were recognized when the
    transactions were completed. During 2004, in separate
    transactions, the Company completed the sale of its Jung Pumpen,
    The Alvic Group, Alma Kuchen, E. Missel and SKS Group business
    units in Europe. Total gross proceeds from the dispositions of
    these companies were $199 million, including cash of
    $193 million and notes receivable of $6 million. The
    Company recognized a pre-tax net gain (principally related to
    the sale of Jung Pumpen) on the dispositions of these businesses
    of $106 million.

During 2005, in separate transactions, the Company completed the
    sale of its Gebhardt Consolidated and GMU Group business units
    in Europe, as part of the Company’s 2004 Plan, as well as
    its Zenith Products and Aran Group businesses. Total gross
    proceeds from the sale of these businesses were
    $319 million; the Company recognized a pre-tax net gain
    (principally related to the sale of Gebhardt Consolidated and
    Zenith Products) on the disposition of these businesses of
    $59 million. During 2005, the Company recorded as gain on
    disposal of discontinued operations, approximately
    $4 million related to the reversal of certain fee and
    expense accruals that were recorded in 2004, as part of the 2004
    Plan. In 2005, the Company also recorded as income from
    discontinued operations $3 million related to the reversal
    of severance accruals that were recorded in 2004.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS – (Concluded)

In 2006, the Company completed the sale of Computerized Security
    Systems (“CSS”). This disposition was completed
    pursuant to the Company’s determination that this business
    unit was not core to the Company’s long-term growth
    strategy. CSS supplies electronic locksets primarily to
    hospitality markets in the United States and Europe and was
    included in the Other Specialty Products segment. As a result of
    the sale, the Company reclassified the net sales and results of
    operations related to CSS to discontinued operations. Total
    gross proceeds from the sale were $92 million; the Company
    recognized a pre-tax net gain on the disposition of CSS of
    $51 million.

Gains from the 2006, 2005 and 2004 discontinued operations
    discussed above were included in income (loss) from discontinued
    operations, net, in the consolidated statements of income.

Selected financial information for the discontinued operations
    during the period owned by the Company, were as follows, in

    for 2006 was the gain related to CSS, as well as additional
    expenses, net of gains reflecting the receipt of final purchase
    price payments, related to businesses disposed in 2005.

Included in income taxes above was income tax related to income
    from discontinued operations of $4 million,
    $15 million and $7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Income (loss) before income taxes above includes
    non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of
    $56 million for 2004.

The unusual relationship between income taxes and income (loss)
    before income taxes in 2004 (including the impairment charge for
    assets held for sale and the net gain on disposals) resulted
    primarily from certain losses providing no current tax benefit
    and from the reversal of deferred tax assets of the discontinued
    operations which were no longer expected to be realized.

During 2006, the Company also completed the sale of Gamco
    Products, General Accessory, Cambridge Brass and Faucet Queens,
    relatively small businesses, the results of which are included
    in continuing operations through the date of sale. These
    businesses had combined net sales and operating profit of
    $16 million and $5 million, respectively, in 2006
    through the respective dates of sale and combined net sales and
    operating profit of $55 million and $12 million,
    respectively, in 2005. Gamco Products is a supplier of plumbing
    products in North America and was included in the Plumbing
    Products segment. General Accessory is a supplier of bathroom
    accessories in North America and was included in the Decorative
    Architectural Products segment. Cambridge Brass is a supplier of
    plumbing fittings in North America and was included in the
    Plumbing Products segment. Faucet Queens is a supplier of home
    hardware and repair products to food and drug stores in North
    America and was included in the Other Specialty Products
    segment. Gross proceeds from the sale of these businesses were
    $72 million; the Company recognized a net gain of
    $1 million in 2006 included in other, net, in continuing
    operations.

Investments in marketable securities are accounted for as

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, the Company records these investments at fair
    value, and unrealized gains and losses (that are deemed to be
    temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect, through
    shareholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income. Realized gains and losses and charges for

other-than-temporary

impairments are included in determining net income, with related
    purchase costs based upon specific identification.

The Company had investments in 18 different marketable
    securities at December 31, 2006. The Company reviews
    industry analyst reports, key ratios and statistics, market
    analyses and other factors for each investment to determine if
    an unrealized loss is

other-than-temporary.

Based upon this review, in 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized
    impairment charges of $28 million and $21 million,
    respectively, related to its then investment in four million
    shares of Furniture Brands International common stock.

At December 31, 2006, no marketable securities were in an
    unrealized loss position for more than twelve months.

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for
    potential impairment when impairment indicators are present, or
    when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may
    have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    investment. Impairment indicators the Company considers include
    the following: whether there has been a significant
    deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business
    prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory,
    economic or technological environment; a significant adverse
    change in the general market condition or geographic area in
    which the investment operates; and, any bona fide offers to
    purchase for less than the carrying value. Since there is no
    active trading market for these investments, they are for the
    most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also
    have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including
    financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future
    changes in market conditions, the future performance of the
    underlying investments or new information provided by private
    equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such
    investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation.

    smaller established businesses, principally in the areas of
    information technology, bio-technology and healthcare. Of the 49
    funds there are seven funds with a carrying value greater than
    $10 million that aggregate $112 million of carrying
    value. It is not practicable for the Company to estimate a fair
    value because the private equity funds have no quoted market
    price and sufficient information is not readily available for
    the Company to utilize a valuation model to determine a fair
    value for each fund.

In November 2000, the Company reduced its common equity
    ownership in Metaldyne Corporation (“Metaldyne”)
    (formerly MascoTech, Inc.) through a recapitalization merger
    with an affiliate of Heartland Industrial Partners, L.P.
    (“Heartland”), a private equity fund in which the
    Company had a remaining investment of $17 million at
    December 31, 2006 (representing less than five percent of
    the fund). The Company in that transaction retained six percent
    of the common equity of Metaldyne. At December 31, 2006,
    the Company also held preferred stock of Metaldyne, which
    accrues dividends at the annual rate of 15 percent.
    Additionally, the Company owned an approximate 10 percent
    investment in TriMas Corporation (“TriMas”) common
    stock. Investments in Metaldyne and TriMas are accounted for on
    the cost basis.

During 2006, based upon a review of new information from the
    Heartland fund concerning fund investments and the continued
    deterioration of conditions in the automotive supplier and
    transportation products markets served by Metaldyne and TriMas,
    the Company determined that the decline in the estimated value
    of certain of its financial investments was

other-than-temporary.

Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2006, the Company
    recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge aggregating
    $78 million for its investments in Metaldyne
    ($40 million), TriMas ($6 million), the Heartland fund
    ($29 million) and another fund ($3 million) which
    invested in automotive and transportation-related suppliers,
    including Metaldyne and TriMas. Additionally, based upon the
    Company’s review, the Company considered the decline in the
    fair value of certain of its other private equity fund
    investments and other investments to be

other-than-temporary

and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of
    $13 million and $15 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
    received new information related to its TriMas investment and
    determined that the additional decline in the estimated value
    for this investment was

other-than-temporary.

Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
    recognized an additional non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of
    $10 million related to its investment in TriMas.

In 2005, the Company reviewed its portfolio of private equity
    funds and determined that there were impairment indicators for
    three funds. As of December 31, 2005, the Company
    determined that the declines in value were temporary based upon
    a review of the fund reports, analysis of investments in the
    funds, analyst reports, industry information, length of time the
    funds have been in existence, the remaining amounts of available
    capital commitments that the fund manager could utilize to
    support its investments and the Company’s ability and
    intent to hold the investments in these funds for a reasonable
    period of time sufficient for the forecasted recovery of fair
    value.

The remaining private equity investments in 2006 and 2005 with
    an aggregate carrying value of $211 million and
    $191 million, respectively, were not evaluated for
    impairment, as there were no indicators of impairment or
    identified events or changes in circumstances that would have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.

Subsequent Event:

On January 11, 2007, the
    acquisition of Metaldyne by Asahi Tec Corporation, a Japanese
    automotive supplier, was finalized. The combined fair value of
    Asahi Tec common and preferred stock received in exchange for
    the Company’s investment in Metaldyne (common and preferred
    stock) approximates $74 million and the Company’s
    carrying value of the Metaldyne investment was $57 million
    at December 31, 2006. As a result, a gain of approximately
    $17 million will be recognized in the first quarter of
    2007. Any unrealized gains or losses subsequent to
    January 11, 2007, will be recognized, net of tax, through
    shareholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
    beginning in the first quarter of 2007.

F. DERIVATIVES

During 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap
    agreements for the purpose of effectively converting a portion
    of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. In 2004, the Company
    terminated two interest rate swaps relating to $850 million
    of fixed-rate debt. These swap agreements were accounted for as
    fair value hedges. The gain of approximately $45 million
    from the termination of these swaps is being amortized as a
    reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the
    debt, through July 2012.

In early 2004, the Company entered into two new interest rate
    swap agreements for the purpose of effectively converting a
    portion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The derivative
    contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions, thereby
    minimizing the risk of credit loss. The interest rate swap
    agreements are designated as fair-value hedges, and the interest
    rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing
    debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the
    term of the agreement. The average variable interest rates are
    based upon LIBOR plus fixed adjustment factors. The average
    effective rate on the interest rate swaps was 6.787% in 2006. At
    December 31, 2006, the interest rate swap agreements
    covered a notional amount of $850 million of the
    Company’s fixed-rate debt due July 15, 2012 with an
    interest rate of 5.875%. The hedges are considered
    100 percent effective.

In 2006, the Company recognized an increase in interest expense
    of $8 million related to this swap agreement, due to
    increasing interest rates. The amount recognized as a reduction
    of interest expense was $3 million and $22 million in
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

At December 31, 2006, the Company, including certain
    European operations, had entered into foreign currency forward
    contracts with notional amounts of $72 million and
    $51 million to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in
    the European euro and the Great Britain pound, respectively. At
    December 31, 2005, the Company, including certain European
    operations, had entered into foreign currency forward contracts
    with notional amounts of $12 million, $10 million and
    $4 million to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in
    the United States dollar, Great Britain pound and various other
    currencies, respectively. Based upon year-end market prices, no
    asset or liability was recorded at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, as the forward prices were substantially the same as the
    contract prices. Gains (losses) related to these contracts are
    recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of income
    in other income (expense), net. The counterparties to the
    Company’s forward contracts are major financial
    institutions. In the unlikely event that the counterparties fail
    to meet the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts, the
    Company’s exposure is limited to the aggregate foreign
    currency rate differential with such institutions.

    quarters of 2006 and 2005. This test indicated that other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired; however,
    goodwill recorded for certain of the Company’s European
    business units was impaired. The Company recognized the related
    non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill of
    $331 million ($331 million, after tax) and
    $69 million ($69 million, after tax)

for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The pre-tax impairment charge,
    recognized in 2006 in the Cabinets and Related Products segment
    related to the Company’s European manufacturer of

ready-to-assemble

cabinets (Tvilum-Scanbirk); and reflects the long-term outlook
    for that business unit, including declining demand for certain
    products, as well as decreased operating profit margins.

Other indefinite-lived intangible assets were $246 million
    and $254 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, and principally included registered trademarks.
    The carrying value of the Company’s definite-lived
    intangible assets was $60 million at December 31, 2006
    (net of accumulated amortization of $51 million) and
    $53 million at December 31, 2005 (net of accumulated
    amortization of $58 million) and principally included
    customer relationships and non-compete agreements, with a
    weighted average amortization period of 13 years and
    12 years in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amortization
    expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets was
    $10 million, $22 million and $20 million in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

At December 31, 2006, amortization expense related to the
    definite-lived intangible assets during each of the next five
    years was as follows: 2007 – $10 million;
    2008 – $8 million; 2009 –

During 2006, the Company retired $800 million of
    6.75% notes due March 2006. During 2006, the Company
    reclassified to current liabilities from long-term debt,
    $823 million of Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes, as
    the next put option date was January 20, 2007,
    $300 million of floating-rate notes due March 2007 and
    $300 million of 4.625% notes due August 2007. On
    October 3, 2006, the Company issued $1 billion of
    fixed-rate 6.125% notes due 2016, resulting in net proceeds
    of $988 million. The Note offering was in anticipation of
    the 2007 debt maturities, including the put option related to
    the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes.

In July 2001, the Company issued $1.9 billion principal
    amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
    2031 (“Old Notes”), resulting in gross proceeds of
    $750 million. The issue price per Note was $394.45 per
    $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented a yield
    to maturity of 3.125% compounded semi-annually. In December
    2004, the Company completed an exchange of the outstanding Old
    Notes for Zero Coupon Convertible Senior
    Notes Series B due July 2031 (“New Notes” or
    “Notes”). The Company exchanged the Notes as a result
    of EITF

No. 04-08

that would have required the total number of shares underlying
    the Old Notes to be included in the calculation of diluted
    earnings per common share, whether or not the Old Notes were
    convertible according to their terms. At December 31, 2006,
    over 99 percent of the outstanding Notes were New Notes.

The New Notes have substantially the same terms as the Old
    Notes, except for the form of consideration payable upon
    conversion. Upon conversion of the Old Notes, the Company would
    have delivered shares of its common stock at the applicable
    conversion rate. Upon conversion of the New Notes, the Company
    will pay the principal return, equal to the lesser of
    (1) the accreted value of the Notes in only cash, and
    (2) the conversion value, as defined, which will be settled
    in cash or shares of Company common stock, or a combination of
    both, at the option of the Company. Similar to the Old Notes,
    the New Notes are convertible if the average price of Company
    common stock for the 20 days immediately prior to the
    conversion date exceeds


/


%,
    declining by 1/3% each year thereafter, of the accreted value of
    the New Notes ($467.03 per $1,000 principal amount at
    maturity as of December 31, 2006) divided by the
    conversion rate of 12.7317 shares for each $1,000 principal
    amount at maturity of the New Notes or $43.41 per common
    share at December 31, 2006. The New Notes, similar to the
    Old Notes, also become convertible if the Company’s credit
    rating is reduced to below investment grade, or if certain
    actions are taken by the Company.

Similar to the Old Notes, the Company will not pay interest in
    cash on the Notes prior to maturity, except in certain
    circumstances, including possible contingent interest payments
    that are not expected to be material. Similar to the Old Notes,
    holders of the New Notes have the option to require that the
    Notes be repurchased by the Company on January 20, 2007,
    July 20, 2011 and every five years thereafter.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had a $2.0 billion

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of banks syndicated in
    the United States and internationally, which expires in February
    2011. This agreement allows for borrowings denominated in
    U.S. dollars or European euros with interest payable based
    upon various floating-rate options as selected by the Company.
    There were no borrowings under the

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

In February 2006, the Company amended the terms of the
    $2.0 billion

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement; the amendment primarily affected the
    requirement for the Company to maintain certain levels of net
    worth. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s net worth
    exceeded such requirement by $1.1 billion. The

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, also contains
    limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2006,
    the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to
    availability, of up to $1.7 billion.

At December 31, 2006, the maturities of long-term debt
    during each of the next five years were as follows:
    2007 – $1,447 million (including
    $825 million related to the Zero Coupon Senior Convertible
    Notes, the accreted value at the next put option date of
    January 20, 2007); 2008 – $112 million;
    2009 – $13 million; 2010 –

At December 31, 2006, the amount of debt and equity
    securities issuable under the Company’s unallocated shelf
    registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission was $500 million.

Interest paid was $238 million, $246 million and
    $219 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Subsequent Event:

On January 20, 2007, holders
    of $1.8 billion (94 percent) principal amount at
    maturity of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes
    (“Notes”) required the Company to repurchase their
    Notes at a cash value of $825 million. As a result of this
    repurchase, a $93 million deferred income tax liability
    will be payable in June 2007. Subsequent to the repurchase,
    there were outstanding $108 million principal amount at
    maturity of such Notes, with an accreted value of
    $51 million, which has been included in long-term debt at
    December 31, 2006, as the next put option date is
    July 20, 2011. The Company may, at any time on or after
    January 25, 2007, redeem all or part of the Notes at their
    accreted value.

The Company owned 64 percent of Hansgrohe AG. The aggregate
    minority interest, net of dividends, of $108 million and

    respectively, was recorded in deferred income taxes and other
    liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 148. Accordingly, options granted, modified
    or settled subsequent to January 1, 2003 have been
    accounted for using the fair value method and options granted
    prior to January 1, 2003 were accounted for using the
    intrinsic value method.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, using the Modified Prospective
    Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method requires
    the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that
    were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through the remaining
    vesting periods. The MPA method does not require the restatement
    of prior-year information. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut
    method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
    options at December 31, 2006.

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) replaced the 1991 Long Term Stock
    Incentive Plan (the “1991 Plan”) in May 2005 and
    provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various
    forms. At December 31, 2006, outstanding stock-based
    incentives were in the form of restricted long-term stock
    awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock
    appreciation rights. Additionally, the Company’s 1997
    Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (the “1997 Plan”)
    provides for the payment of part of the compensation to
    non-employee Directors in Company common stock.

    after tax), related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.
    In addition, during 2006, the Company recognized expense of
    $3 million (net of income tax benefit of $2 million)
    as a cumulative effect of accounting change, net, related to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R and the change from the
    intrinsic value method to the fair value method of accounting
    for stock appreciation rights.

At December 31, 2006, a total of 19,975,100 shares and
    303,400 shares of Company common stock were available under
    the 2005 Plan and the 1997 Plan, respectively, for the granting
    of stock options and other restricted long-term stock incentive
    awards.

Restricted
    Long-Term Stock Awards

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and
    non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share
    dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of
    repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open
    market.

The Company’s long-term stock award activity was as

The Company continues to measure compensation expense for stock
    awards at the market price of the Company’s common stock at
    the grant date. Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is
    being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period
    of the stock awards, typically 10 years (except for stock
    awards held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over
    five years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes
    retirement-eligible at age 65. For stock awards granted
    prior to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized
    over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically
    10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will
    become, retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the
    expense is being recognized over five years. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company had remaining
    $21 million of

unrecognized compensation expense related to stock awards
    granted prior to January 1, 2006 to grantees that will or
    have become retirement-eligible before such awards will have
    been fully expensed; such expense will be recognized over the
    next six years, or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement.

There was $185 million of unrecognized compensation
    expense, which was included as a reduction of shareholders’
    equity, at December 31, 2005; such expense was reclassified
    to common stock and retained earnings on January 1, 2006 in
    accordance with SFAS No. 123R. At January 1,
    2006, the Company estimated a forfeiture rate for long-term
    stock awards and applied that rate to all previously expensed
    stock awards; such application did not result in a change in the
    expense to be recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting
    change. At December 31, 2006, there was $195 million
    of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock
    awards; such awards had a weighted average remaining vesting
    period of seven years.

The total market value (at the vesting date) of stock award
    shares which vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
    $51 million, $60 million and $45 million,
    respectively.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market
    price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date.
    These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over
    five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
    grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant
    date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration
    stock options, except for restoration options resulting from
    options previously granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration
    stock options become exercisable six months from the date of
    grant.

The Company granted 4,317,000 of stock option shares, including
    restoration stock option shares, during 2006 with a grant date
    exercise price range of $26 to $33 per share. During 2006,
    922,000 stock option shares were forfeited (including options
    that expired unexercised).

Aggregate intrinsic value is calculated using the Company’s

    (grant date price) multiplied by the number of shares.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock options
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is
    being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of
    time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123.
    For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, such
    expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of
    the stock options, typically five years. At December 31,
    2006, the Company had $16 million of unrecognized
    compensation expense related to stock options granted prior to
    January 1, 2006 to grantees that will or have become
    retirement-eligible before such options will have been fully
    expensed; such expense will be recognized over the next four
    years, or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement.

At December 31, 2006, there was $90 million of
    unrecognized compensation expense (using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model) related to unvested stock options; such
    options had a weighted average remaining vesting period of three
    years. At January 1, 2006, the Company estimated a
    forfeiture rate for stock options and applied that rate to all
    previously expensed stock options; such application did not
    result in a change in the expense to be recorded as a cumulative
    effect of accounting change.

The Company received cash of $28 million, $33 million

Phantom Stock
    Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights
    (“SARs”)

The Company grants phantom stock awards and SARs to certain

non-U.S. employees.

Phantom stock awards are linked to the value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant and are settled
    in cash upon vesting, typically over 10 years. The Company
    continues to account for phantom stock awards as liability-based
    awards; the compensation expense is initially measured as the
    market price of the Company’s common stock at the grant
    date and is recognized over the vesting period. The liability is
    remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period
    until the awards are fully-vested and paid to the employees. For
    2006, the Company granted 175,000 shares of phantom stock
    awards with an aggregate fair value of $5 million and paid
    $4 million in cash to settle phantom stock awards.

SARs are linked to the value of the Company’s common stock
    and are settled in cash upon exercise. On January 1, 2006,
    the Company changed its method of accounting for SARs, in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, from
    the intrinsic value method to the fair value method. The fair
    value method requires outstanding SARs to be classified as
    liability-based awards and valued using a Black-

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION – (Concluded)

Scholes option pricing model at the grant date; such fair value
    is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period,
    typically five years. The liability is remeasured and adjusted
    at the end of each reporting period until the SARs are exercised
    and payment is made to the employees or the SARs expire. As a
    result of implementing this change, during 2006, the Company
    recognized expense of $3 million (net of income tax benefit
    of $2 million) as a cumulative effect of accounting change,
    net. The Company also recognized expense of $400,000 related to
    the valuation of SARs for 2006. During 2006, the Company granted
    SARs for 422,300 shares with an aggregate fair value of
    $4 million.

N. EMPLOYEE
    RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors qualified defined-benefit and
    defined-contribution retirement plans for most of its employees.
    In addition to the Company’s qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans, the Company has unfunded non-qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans covering certain employees, which
    provide for benefits in addition to those provided by the
    qualified pension plans. Substantially all salaried employees
    participate in non-contributory defined-contribution retirement
    plans, to which payments are determined annually by the
    Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. Aggregate charges to earnings under the
    Company’s defined-benefit and defined-contribution
    retirement plans were $54 million and $44 million in
    2006, $51 million and $42 million in 2005 and
    $55 million and $42 million in 2004, respectively.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),”
    (“SFAS No. 158”). Among other things,
    SFAS No. 158 requires companies to prospectively
    recognize a net liability or asset and to report the funded
    status of their defined-benefit pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans on their balance sheets, with an offsetting
    adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income; such
    recognition did not affect the Company’s consolidated
    statements of income. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 was
    effective for the year ended December 31, 2006, and the
    effect was included in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet.

Adjustments made to the Company’s recorded assets and

The investment objectives of the Company’s qualified

    of fees, greater than or equal to the expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets; 2) to diversify the portfolio among
    various asset classes with the goal of reducing volatility of
    return and reducing principal risk; and 3) to maintain
    liquidity sufficient to meet Plan obligations. Long-term target
    allocations are: equity securities (85%), debt securities (5%)
    and other investments (10%).

Plan assets included 1.4 million shares of Company common
    stock valued at $42 million and $43 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected
    duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities
    matched to the December 31, 2006 Citigroup Pension Discount
    Curve. Such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension
    plans ranged from 4.00 percent to 6.00 percent, with
    the most significant portion of the liabilities having a
    discount rate for obligations of 5.50 percent or higher at
    December 31, 2006.

The Company determined the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets by reviewing an analysis of expected and historical
    rates of return of various asset classes based upon the current
    asset allocation of the plan assets. The measurement date used
    to determine the defined-benefit pension expense is primarily
    December 31.

The Company sponsors certain post-retirement benefit plans that
    provide medical, dental and life insurance coverage for eligible
    retirees and dependents in the United States based upon age and
    length of service. The aggregate present value of the unfunded
    accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
    $9 million (including $2 million related to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 158) and $7 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Cash

At December 31, 2006, the Company expected to contribute

    of $2 million and $8 million, respectively to
    participants of its unfunded qualified and non-qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans in 2007.

At December 31, 2006, the benefits expected to be paid in

In May 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase for retirement of up to 50 million shares of
    the Company’s common stock in open-market transactions or
    otherwise, replacing a previous Board of Directors authorization

The Company made dividend distributions of accumulated earnings
    from certain of its foreign subsidiaries from 2004 to 2006.
    These dividend distributions generated significant foreign tax
    credits that were used to offset the majority of the
    U.S. tax on the dividend distributions and created a
    $61 million and $50 million foreign tax credit
    carryforward at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

EARNINGS PER
    COMMON SHARE – (Concluded)

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company did not include
    any common shares related to the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior
    Notes (“Notes”) in the calculation of diluted earnings
    per common share, as the price of the Company’s common
    stock at December 31, 2006 and 2005 did not exceed the
    equivalent accreted value of the Notes. At December 31,
    2004, the Company included approximately one million common
    shares related to the Notes in the calculation of diluted
    earnings per common share, as the price of the Company’s
    common stock at December 31, 2004 exceeded the equivalent
    accreted value of the Notes.

Additionally, 16 million common shares, 13 million
    common shares and one million common shares for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively, related to stock options were excluded from
    the computation of diluted earnings per common share due to
    their antidilutive effect.

Common shares outstanding included on the Company’s balance
    sheet and for the calculation of earnings per common share do
    not include unvested stock awards (nine million common shares at
    December 31, 2006); shares outstanding for legal
    requirements include all common shares that have voting rights
    (including unvested stock awards).

T.

OTHER COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary
    course of business.

As the Company reported in previous filings, late in the second
    half of 2002, the Company and its subsidiary, Behr Process
    Corporation, agreed to two Settlements (the National Settlement
    and the Washington State Settlement) to resolve all class action
    lawsuits pending in the United States involving certain exterior
    wood coating products formerly manufactured by Behr. The
    evaluation, processing and payment of claims for both the
    National Settlement and the Washington State Settlement were
    completed in 2006 except for a small number of administrative
    appeals of claim awards, which should be resolved in the first
    half of 2007.

Early in 2003, a suit was brought against the Company and a
    number of its insulation installation companies in the federal
    court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleging that certain practices
    violate provisions of federal and state antitrust laws. The
    plaintiff publicized the lawsuit with a press release and stated
    in that release that the U.S. Department of Justice was
    investigating the business practices of the Company’s
    insulation installation companies. Although the Company was
    unaware of any investigation at that time, the Company was later
    advised that an investigation had been commenced but was
    subsequently closed without any enforcement action recommended.
    Two additional lawsuits were subsequently brought in Virginia
    making similar claims under the antitrust laws. Both of these
    lawsuits have since been dismissed without any payment or
    requirement for any change in business practices. During the
    second half of 2004, the same counsel who commenced the initial
    action in Atlanta filed six additional lawsuits on behalf of
    several of Masco’s competitors in the insulation
    installation business. The plaintiffs then dismissed all of
    these lawsuits and, represented by the same counsel, filed
    another action in the same federal court as a putative class
    action against the Company, a number of its insulation
    installation companies and certain of their suppliers. All of
    the Company’s suppliers who are co-defendants in this
    lawsuit have agreed in principle with the plaintiffs to settle
    this matter. This suit currently seeks class representation for
    residential insulation contractors (other than the defendants
    and their affiliates) that have directly purchased fiberglass
    insulation suitable for residential installation from certain
    insulation manufacturers. The Company is opposing certification
    of this lawsuit which seeks to proceed on a class

representation basis. An additional lawsuit, seeking class
    action status and alleging anticompetitive conduct, was filed in
    a Florida state court against the Company and a number of its
    insulation suppliers. This lawsuit was recently dismissed by the
    court with prejudice. Based upon the advice of its outside
    counsel, the Company believes that the conduct of the Company
    and its insulation installation companies, which has been the
    subject of the above-described lawsuits, has not violated any
    antitrust laws. There cannot, however, be any assurance that the
    Company will ultimately prevail in the remaining lawsuits or, if
    unsuccessful, that the ultimate liability would not be material.
    The Company is unable at this time to reliably estimate any
    potential liability which might occur from an adverse judgment
    but does not believe that any adverse judgment would have a
    material adverse effect on its businesses or the methods used by
    its insulation installation companies in doing business.

In February 2003, a suit was served upon the Company’s
    subsidiary, Milgard Manufacturing, in the Solano County,
    California Superior Court, alleging design defects in certain of
    Milgard’s aluminum windows. The complaint requests class
    action status for all owners of homes in California in which the
    windows are installed, and seeks replacement costs and other
    damages. Milgard denies that the windows are defective and is
    vigorously defending the case. In August 2006 the trial court
    denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
    Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the California Court of
    Appeals. Based upon the advice of its outside counsel, Milgard
    believes that the trial court ruling should be affirmed by the
    appellate court.

In 2004, the Company learned that European governmental
    authorities were investigating possible anticompetitive business
    practices relating to the plumbing and heating industries in
    Europe. The investigations involve a number of European
    companies, including certain of the Company’s European
    manufacturing divisions and a number of other large businesses.
    As part of its broadened governance activities, the Company,
    with the assistance of its outside counsel, completed a review
    of the competition practices of its European divisions,
    including those in the plumbing and heating industries, and the
    Company is cooperating fully with the European governmental
    authorities. Several private antitrust lawsuits have been filed
    in the United States as putative class actions against, among
    others, the Company and certain of the other companies being
    investigated relating to the defendants’ plumbing
    operations. These appear to be an outgrowth of the
    investigations being conducted by European governmental
    authorities. These lawsuits have been dismissed; however, the
    Company has been notified that a notice of appeal has been filed
    in one of these lawsuits. Based upon the advice of its outside
    counsel, the review of the competition practices of its European
    divisions referred to above and other factors, the Company
    believes that it will not incur material liability as a result
    of the matters that are the subject of these investigations.

Warranty

Certain of the Company’s products and product finishes and
    services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in
    material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to
    the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any
    changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
    servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted
    accordingly.

Acquisition-Related
    Commitments

As part of the agreement relating to the Company’s
    acquisition of an additional 37 percent equity ownership of
    Hansgrohe AG in December 2002 (increasing such ownership to
    64 percent), certain minority shareholders of Hansgrohe AG,
    representing four percent of Hansgrohe outstanding shares, hold
    an option expiring in December 2007 to require the Company to
    purchase such shares in Hansgrohe either with cash or Company
    common stock. The put option can only be exercised once by each
    minority shareholder and only with respect to all of such
    shares. The fair value of the put option is not material. The
    amount payable under the put option to acquire shares is based
    upon Hansgrohe’s operating results (principally a multiple
    of operating earnings which is designed to reflect the
    appropriate fair value of the shares) and, if exercised at
    December 31, 2006, would have approximated $42 million
    if settled in cash; if the put option were settled in stock, the
    common shares to be issued at December 31, 2006 would have
    been 1,588,300. Such shares were included in the Company’s
    diluted share count for computation of earnings per common share.

The Company, as part of certain acquisition agreements, provided
    for the payment of additional consideration in either cash or
    Company common stock, contingent upon whether certain conditions
    are met, including the operating performance of the acquired
    business and the price of the Company’s common stock. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company had additional consideration
    payable in cash of $6 million contingent upon the operating
    performance of the acquired businesses.

Stock Price
    Guarantees

During 2005, the Company settled the guarantee related to the
    value of 1.6 million shares of Company common stock for a
    stock price of $40 per share related to a 2001 divestiture.
    The guarantee was settled for cash and stock aggregating
    approximately $12 million. At December 31, 2006 and
    2005, there were no outstanding stock price guarantees.

Investments

With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity
    funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2006, commitments
    to contribute up to $60 million of additional capital to
    such funds representing the Company’s aggregate capital
    commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to
    date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional
    capital contributions to certain of its private equity funds
    upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. The
    Company has no control over when or if the capital calls will
    occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in
    an increase in the carrying value of the Company’s
    investment in the private equity fund when paid.

OTHER COMMITMENTS

Residual Value
    Guarantees

The Company has residual value guarantees resulting from
    operating leases, primarily related to certain of the
    Company’s trucks and other vehicles, in the Installation
    and Other Services segment. The operating leases are generally
    for a minimum term of 18 to 24 months and are renewable
    monthly after the initial term. After the end of the initial
    term, if the Company cancels the leases, the Company must pay
    the lessor the difference between the guaranteed residual value
    and the fair market value of the related vehicles. The value of
    lease-related guarantees, including the obligation payable under
    the residual value guarantees, assuming the fair value at lease
    termination is zero, was approximately $88 million at
    December 31, 2006.

For all operating leases that contain residual value guarantee
    provisions (principally related to vehicles), the Company
    calculates the amount due under the guarantees and compares such
    amount to the fair value of the leased assets. If the amount
    payable under the residual value guarantee exceeds the fair
    value at lease termination, the Company would record a liability
    equal to such excess with a corresponding charge to earnings. At
    December 31, 2006, the estimated fair market value exceeded
    the amount payable under the residual value guarantees and no
    liability was recorded.

Other
    Matters

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and
    customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries
    in which it operates. Such indemnifications include customer
    claims against builders for issues relating to the
    Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with
    divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally
    provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to
    various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal
    and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and
    asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material
    amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the
