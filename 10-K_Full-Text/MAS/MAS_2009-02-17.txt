2008 Annual Report on

Form 10-K




PART I

Item 1. Business.

Masco Corporation (the “Company”) manufactures,
    distributes and installs home improvement and building products,
    with emphasis on brand name consumer products and services
    holding leadership positions in their markets. The Company is
    among the largest manufacturers in North America of a number of
    home improvement and building products, including faucets,
    cabinets, architectural coatings and windows and is one of the
    largest installers of insulation for the new home construction
    market. The Company generally provides broad product offerings
    in a variety of styles and price points and distributes products
    through multiple channels including home builders and wholesale
    and retail channels. Approximately 78 percent of the
    Company’s 2008 sales were generated by North American
    operations.

Over the past several years, the Company has been focused on the
    strategic rationalization of its businesses, including business
    consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system
    implementations and other initiatives. As a result of the recent
    dramatic downturn in the home improvement and new home
    construction markets, the Company has implemented several plant
    closures. In addition, the Company has idled two cabinet plants
    and one window plant. Since 2006, the Company has closed over 80
    locations formerly operated by its Installation and Other
    Services segment, including closing 29 such locations in 2008.

The Company reports its results in five business segments
    arranged by similarity in products and services. The following
    table sets forth, for the three years ended December 31,
    2008, the contribution of the Company’s segments to net
    sales and operating profit. Additional financial information
    concerning the Company’s operations by segment and by
    geographic regions, as well as general corporate expense, as of
    and for the three years ended December 31, 2008, is set
    forth in Note Q to the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Cabinets and
    Related Products

In North America, the Company manufactures and sells economy,
    stock, semi-custom, assembled and

ready-to-assemble

cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home
    entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price
    points. In Europe, the Company manufactures and sells assembled
    and

ready-to-assemble

kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home entertainment
    cabinetry. These products are sold under a number of trademarks
    including
    KRAFTMAID

®

,

    DISTINCTIONS

®

,

    TVILUM-SCANBIRK

tm

and
    WOODGATE

®

primarily to dealers and home centers, and under the names
    MERILLAT

®

,

    MOORES

tm

and QUALITY
    CABINETS

®

primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the home
    improvement and new home construction markets. Cabinet sales are
    significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home
    construction and retail consumer spending, particularly spending
    for major home improvement products. A significant portion of
    our sales for the home improvement market is made through home
    center retailers.

Recently, the Company has intensified its focus on lean
    manufacturing principles and is moving toward a more flexible
    and scalable manufacturing capability. The related goal of the
    Cabinet and Related Products segment is to be able to
    manufacture a common base cabinet at all of its plants that
    principally manufacture cabinets for the new home construction
    market. This approach is intended to allow the Company to
    strengthen cabinet production efficiencies at lower volumes and
    to respond effectively to increased demand when the new home
    construction market improves.

The cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States and
    Europe is highly competitive, with several large competitors and
    numerous local and regional competitors. In addition to price,
    the Company believes that competition in this industry is based
    largely on product quality, responsiveness to customer needs,
    product features and selection. Significant North American
    competitors include American Woodmark Corporation, Fortune
    Brands, Inc. and Cardell Cabinetry.

Plumbing
    Products

The Company sells a wide variety of faucet and showering devices
    that are manufactured by or for the Company. The Company’s
    plumbing products are sold in North America and Europe under
    various brand names including
    DELTA

®

    PEERLESS

    Products include single- and double-handle faucets, showerheads,
    handheld showers and valves, which are sold by
    manufacturers’ representatives and Company sales personnel
    to major retail accounts and to distributors who sell these
    products to plumbers, building contractors, remodelers, smaller
    retailers and others.

Masco believes that its faucet operations are among the leaders
    in sales in the North American market, with American Standard,
    Kohler, Moen and Price Pfister as major brand competitors. The
    Company also has several major competitors among the European
    manufacturers, primarily in Germany and Italy, including
    Friedrich Grohe. The Company faces significant competition from
    private label



products (including house brands sold by certain of the
    Company’s customers). Many of the faucet and showering
    products with which the Company’s products compete are
    manufactured in Asia. The businesses in the Company’s
    Plumbing Products segment source products from Asia and
    manufacture products in the United States, Europe, the United
    Kingdom and Asia.

Other plumbing products manufactured and sold by the Company
    include AQUA
    GLASS

®

,

    MIROLIN

®

and AMERICAN SHOWER &
    BATH

tm

acrylic and gelcoat bath and shower enclosure units, shower
    trays and laundry tubs, which are sold primarily to wholesale
    plumbing distributors and home center retailers for the North
    American home improvement and new home construction markets. The
    Company’s spas are manufactured and sold under HOT
    SPRING

®

,

    CALDERA

®

and other trademarks directly to independent dealers. Major
    competitors include Kohler, Lasco, Maax and Jacuzzi.
    HÜPPE

®

and
    BREUER

tm

shower enclosures are sold by the Company through wholesale
    channels and home centers primarily in western Europe.
    HERITAGE

tm

ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally
    sold in the United Kingdom directly to selected retailers.

Also included in the Plumbing Products segment are brass and
    copper plumbing system components and other plumbing
    specialties, which are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware
    wholesalers and to home center retailers, hardware stores,
    building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These
    products are marketed in North America for the wholesale trade
    under the
    BRASSCRAFT

®

and BRASSTECH trademarks and for the “do-it-yourself”
    market under the MASTER
    PLUMBER

®

and PLUMB SHOP trademarks and are also sold under private label.

In addition to price, the Company believes that competition in
    its Plumbing Products markets is based largely on brand
    reputation, product quality, product features, and breadth of
    product offering.

A substantial portion of the Company’s plumbing products
    are made from brass, the major components of which are copper
    and zinc. From time to time, the Company has encountered
    volatility in the price of brass. The Company is considering a
    hedging strategy to attempt to minimize the impact of commodity
    price volatility. In addition, legislation enacted in California
    and Vermont to become effective in January 2010 mandates new
    standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold
    in those states. Similar legislation may be considered by other
    states. Faucet and water supply valve manufacturers, including
    the Company, will be required to obtain adequate supplies of
    lead-free brass or suitable alternative materials for continued
    production of faucets. An increase in the demand for lead-free
    brass may cause a shortage of supply and resulting price
    increases and could adversely impact this segment’s
    operating results.

In 2008, the Company’s Delta Faucet business introduced a
    new water delivery system known as
    DIAMOND

tm

Seal Technology.
    DIAMOND

tm

Seal Technology, which replaces existing valve technology,
    reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet,
    simplifies installation and satisfies the legislation enacted in
    California and Vermont regulating the acceptable lead content in
    plumbing products. Delta Faucet, in the near term, plans to
    incorporate
    DIAMOND

tm

Seal Technology into its domestically manufactured single-handle
    faucets and, in the future, plans to expand the application of
    the technology to most other Delta faucets. The success of
    DIAMOND

tm

Seal Technology depends on many factors, including the
    performance of the technology and the market’s acceptance
    of the technology as well as Delta’s ability to integrate
    successfully the technology into its most popular faucets.

Installation and
    Other Services

The Company’s Installation and Other Services segment sells
    installed building products and distributes building products
    primarily to the new home construction market, and to a lesser
    extent, the commercial construction market, throughout the
    United States. In light of the current economic environment in
    the new home construction industry, the Company has decided to
    de-emphasize the installation of certain non-insulation building
    products that are not core to its service offering, including
    windows and paint. In addition to insulation, our current
    offering of installed building products primarily consists of
    gutters, fireplaces, garage doors and framing components. The
    installation and distribution of insulation comprised
    approximately 11 percent, 12 percent and
    15 percent of the



Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Distributed
    products include insulation, insulation accessories, gutters,
    roofing and fireplaces. Installed building products are supplied
    primarily to custom and production homebuilders by the
    Company’s network of branches located in most major markets
    throughout the United States. Distributed products are sold
    primarily to contractors and dealers from distribution centers
    in various parts of the United States.

In addition to price, the Company believes that competition in
    this industry is based largely on customer service and the
    quality of installation service. The Company believes that it is
    the largest national provider of installed insulation in the new
    home construction industry in the United States. Competitors
    include several regional contractors, as well as numerous local
    contractors and lumber yards. The Company believes that its
    financial resources are substantial compared to regional and
    local contractors.

The Installation and Other Services segment is a labor-intensive
    business. Significant changes in federal, state and local
    regulations addressing immigration and wages, as well as
    collective bargaining arrangements affecting wages and working
    conditions, could adversely affect the financial performance of
    the Company’s business.

Decorative
    Architectural Products

The Company manufactures architectural coatings including
    paints, specialty paint products, stains, varnishes and
    waterproofing products. The products are sold in the United
    States and Canada under the brand names
    BEHR

®

,

    KILZ

®

,

    CASUAL
    COLORS

®

and
    EXPRESSIONS

®

to the “do-it-yourself” and professional markets
    through home centers, paint stores and other retailers. Net
    sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately
    15 percent, 13 percent and 12 percent of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Competitors
    in the architectural coatings market include large national and
    international brands such as Benjamin Moore, Glidden, Olympic,
    Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Zinsser, as well as many regional
    and other national brands. In addition to price, the Company
    believes that competition in this industry is based largely on
    product quality, technology and product innovation, customer
    service and brand reputation.

The BEHR brand is sold through The Home Depot, the
    segment’s and the Company’s largest customer. The
    paint departments at The Home Depot stores include the Behr
    color center and computer kiosk with the COLOR SMART BY
    BEHR

®

computerized color-matching system that enables consumers to
    select and coordinate their paint-color selection. The loss of
    the segment’s sales to The Home Depot would have a material
    adverse effect on the segment’s business and on the Company
    as a whole.

Titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of
    paint. Shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium
    dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand
    and from production capacity limitations. Petroleum products are
    also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings.
    Significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas
    lead to higher raw material costs (e.g., for resins, solvents
    and packaging, as well as titanium dioxide), which can adversely
    affect the segment’s results of operations.

The Decorative Architectural Products segment also includes
    LIBERTY

®

cabinet, door, window and other hardware, which is manufactured
    for the Company and sold to home centers, other retailers,
    original equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets. Key
    competitors in North America include Amerock, Belwith, Umbra and
    Stanley. Decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are
    sold under the brand names FRANKLIN
    BRASS

®

and DECOR
    BATHWARE

®

to distributors, home center retailers and other retailers.
    Competitors include Moen and Globe Union.

Other Specialty
    Products

The Company manufactures and sells vinyl, fiberglass and
    aluminum windows and patio doors under the
    MILGARD

®

brand name to the new home construction and home improvement
    markets,



principally in the western United States. MILGARD products are
    sold primarily through dealers and, to a lesser extent, direct
    to production homebuilders and through lumberyards and home
    center retailers. The segment’s competitors in North
    America include national brands, such as Jeld-Wen, Simonton,
    Pella and Andersen, and numerous regional brands. In the United
    Kingdom, the Company manufactures and sells windows, related
    products and components under several brand names including
    GRIFFIN

tm

,

    CAMBRIAN

tm

,

    PREMIER

tm

and
    DURAFLEX

tm

.

    Sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the
    repair and remodeling markets, although the Company’s
    Duraflex business is also a supplier to other window
    fabricators. United Kingdom competitors include many small and
    mid-sized firms and a few large, vertically integrated
    competitors. In addition to price, the Company believes that
    competition in this industry is based largely on customer
    service and product quality.

The Company manufactures and sells a complete line of manual and
    electric staple gun tackers, staples and other fastening tools
    under the brand names
    ARROW

®

and
    POWERSHOT

®

.

    These products are sold through various distribution channels
    including home centers and other retailers and wholesalers. The
    principal North American competitor in this product line is
    Stanley.

Additional
    Information

•

The Company holds United States and foreign patents, patent
    applications, licenses, trademarks and trade names. As a
    manufacturer and distributor of brand name products, we view our
    trademarks and other proprietary rights as important, but do not
    believe that there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of
    such rights that would have a material adverse effect on our
    present business as a whole.

•

All of the Company’s operating segments, except the
    Plumbing Products segment, normally experience stronger sales
    during the second and third calendar quarters, corresponding
    with the peak season for new home construction and remodeling.

•

The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. The Company accrues for expenses
    associated with environmental remediation obligations in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States. In addition to responsibilities relating to
    environmental remediation, the Company’s businesses are
    subject to other requirements regarding protection of the
    environment and worker health and safety. Examples include the
    Cabinet and Related Products segment, which is subject to laws
    and regulations relating to formaldehyde emissions which may
    impact the manufacturing process for particleboard as well as
    requirements relating to the emission of volatile organic
    compounds which may require special equipment to be installed in
    manufacturing facilities; the Decorative Architectural Products
    segment is subject to laws and regulations relating to volatile
    organic compounds which may require, from time to time, the
    reformulation of paint products; and the Plumbing Products
    segment which is subject to restrictions on lead content in some
    of its plumbing products. Compliance with such laws and
    regulations could significantly affect product performance as
    well as production costs. The Company monitors applicable laws
    and regulations relating to the protection of the environment
    and worker health and safety, and incurs ongoing expense
    relating to compliance. Compliance with the federal, state and
    local regulations relating to the discharge of materials into
    the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
    environment and worker health and safety, is not expected to
    result in material capital expenditures by the Company or to
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s earnings or
    competitive position.

•

The Company does not consider backlog orders to be material.

•

At December 31, 2008, the Company employed approximately
    39,000 people. Satisfactory relations have generally
    prevailed between the Company and its employees.

Item 1A. Risk
    Factors.

There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that have
    affected and may continue to affect our business. These risks
    and uncertainties have negatively impacted our current results
    and could cause future results to differ from past performance
    or expected results, including results described in statements
    elsewhere in this Report that constitute “forward-looking
    statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
    Act of 1995. The effect on us of certain of these risk factors
    is discussed below under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.” Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be
    immaterial, also may adversely impact our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. These risks and
    uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following,
    which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business
    activities.

A significant
    portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home
    construction activity levels, both of which are experiencing a
    significant downturn.

A significant portion of our business relies on home improvement
    (including repair and remodeling) and new home construction
    activity levels, principally in North America and Europe. The
    new home construction market, which is cyclical in nature, is
    undergoing a significant downturn marked by declines in the
    demand for new homes, an oversupply of new and existing homes on
    the market and a reduction in the availability of financing for
    homebuyers. The oversupply of existing homes has been
    exacerbated by a growing number of home mortgage foreclosures,
    which is further contributing to downward pressure on home
    prices.

Unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction
    in which we did not experience comparable declines in our home
    improvement businesses, the current economic decline is
    adversely affecting our home improvement businesses as well. Low
    levels of consumer confidence and the downward pressure on home
    prices have made it much more difficult for homeowners to make
    additional investments in existing homes, such as kitchen and
    bath remodeling projects. Further, recent disruptions in credit
    markets have limited the ability of consumers to finance home
    improvements.

Although we believe the long-term outlook for the home
    improvement and new home construction markets is favorable, we
    cannot provide any assurances that current market conditions
    will not deteriorate further and we cannot predict the timing or
    strength of a recovery in these markets. Continued depressed
    activity levels in consumer spending for home improvement and
    new home construction will continue to adversely affect our
    results of operations and our financial position. Furthermore,
    continued economic turmoil may cause unanticipated shifts in
    consumer preferences and purchasing practices and in the
    business models and strategies of our customers. Such shifts may
    alter the nature and prices of products demanded by the end
    consumer and our customers and could adversely affect our
    operating performance.

Continued
    disruption in the financial markets could harm our
    business.

We, our customers and end consumers rely on stable and efficient
    financial markets. The credit markets and the financial services
    industry have experienced significant disruptions, characterized
    by



the bankruptcy and failure of several financial institutions and
    severe limitations on credit availability. The disruptions in
    the financial markets have adversely affected, and could
    continue to adversely affect, our operations in a variety of
    ways. The financial stability of certain of our customers has
    been negatively impacted, which has resulted in increased bad
    debt expense for us. A prolonged continuation of adverse
    economic conditions would cause additional financial distress
    for our customers and could compromise the financial condition
    of our suppliers, which could result in non-performance by
    certain of our suppliers. In addition, our own borrowing costs
    are increasing and our access to capital markets may be reduced.
    In December 2008, our senior debt ratings were lowered by two
    credit rating agencies, including by one agency to below
    investment grade. As a result of the general deterioration in
    financial markets, as well as the lowering of our credit
    ratings, costs under our existing credit facilities have
    increased and may continue to increase, and it may become more
    difficult for us to obtain financing to fund operations or to
    refinance our existing debt obligations. Further, the dramatic
    deterioration in general economic conditions over the past
    several months has resulted in the decline in the value of our
    investments in debt and equity securities, including the assets
    held in our pension plans.

A prolonged
    economic downturn would reduce our financial resources and
    flexibility.

The valuation of assets on our balance sheet, particularly
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is largely
    dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our
    businesses. The reduced expectations of future performance have
    caused us to recognize impairment charges for certain long-lived
    assets, including goodwill, and a continuation of the adverse
    conditions in our markets may result in additional impairment
    charges and a reduction in our shareholders’ equity in the
    future.

Such a reduction in our shareholders’ equity and other
    adverse effects of a prolonged economic downturn on our results
    of operations and financial position would reduce our financial
    resources and flexibility and increase the relative impact on
    the Company of other developments that otherwise affect us.

We rely on key
    customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our
    distribution channels.

The size and importance of individual customers to our
    businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution
    channels have consolidated or exited the business. Larger
    customers can effect significant changes in their volume of
    purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we
    receive for our products and services, our costs of doing
    business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do
    business. Further, as discussed above, during downturns in our
    markets, declines in the financial condition and
    creditworthiness of customers may impact the volume of our
    business, the credit risk involved and our terms of doing
    business with them. Sales of our home improvement and building
    products to home center retailers are substantial. In 2008,
    sales to our largest customer, The Home Depot, were
    $2.1 billion (approximately 21 percent of our
    consolidated net sales). Lowe’s is our second largest
    customer. In 2008, our sales to Lowe’s were less than
    10 percent of our consolidated net sales. Although
    homebuilders, dealers and other retailers represent other
    channels of distribution for our products and services, the loss
    of a substantial portion of our sales to The Home Depot or the
    loss of our sales to Lowe’s would have a material adverse
    effect on our business.

As some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted
    customers, conflicts between our existing distribution channels
    have occurred, and will continue to occur. In addition, we may
    undermine the business relationships we have with customers who
    purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as
    we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our
    larger customers. In addition, our large retail customers are
    increasingly requesting product exclusivity, which may affect
    the products we can offer to other customers.



Our principal
    markets are highly competitive.

The major geographic markets for our products and services are
    highly competitive and, in recent years, competition has
    intensified significantly. Competition is further exacerbated
    during economic downturns. Home center retailers are increasing
    their purchases of products directly from manufacturers,
    particularly low-cost suppliers in Asia, for sale as private
    label and house brand merchandise. Also, home center retailers,
    which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on
    retail consumers and remodelers, are increasingly turning their
    marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and
    installers. We believe that competition in our industries is
    based largely on price, product and service quality, brand
    reputation, customer service and product features and
    innovation. Although the relative importance of such factors
    varies among customers and product categories, price is often a
    primary factor.

In addition to the challenges we are facing as a result of the
    current economic downturn, our ability to maintain our
    competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses
    depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our
    relationships with major customers, implementing growth
    strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic
    markets, capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names,
    managing our cost structure, accommodating shorter life-cycles
    for our products and product development and innovation.

The cost and
    availability of materials and the performance of our supply
    chain affect our operating results.

It has been, and likely will continue to be, difficult for us to
    pass on to customers cost increases for commodities or other
    materials that are major components of our products or services.
    In addition, we may incur substantial costs as part of our
    strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain
    commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase
    supplies at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices.
    Delays in adjusting, or in our inability to adjust, selling
    prices may be due to factors such as our existing arrangements
    with customers, competitive considerations and customer
    resistance to price increases. Further, when commodity prices
    decline, we receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices
    for our products and services. Changes in energy costs and
    certain commodities not only impact our production costs, but
    also the cost to transport our products.

We manufacture products in Asia and source products and
    components from third parties in Asia. The distances involved in
    these arrangements, together with differences in business
    practices, shipping and delivery requirements, the limited
    number of suppliers, and laws and regulations, have increased
    the difficulty of managing our supply chain, the complexity of
    our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions
    in our production scheduling.

We rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain
    of our products or key components. If there is an interruption
    in these sources of supply, we may experience difficulty or
    delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be
    disrupted.

International
    political, monetary, economic and social developments affect our
    business.

Over 20 percent of our sales are derived outside of North
    America (principally in Europe) and are transacted in currencies
    other than U.S. dollars (principally European euros and
    Great Britain pounds). In addition, we manufacture products in
    Asia and source products and components from third parties in
    Asia. Our international business faces risks associated with
    changes in political, monetary, economic and social
    environments, labor conditions and practices, the laws,
    regulations and policies of foreign governments, cultural
    differences and differences in enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights. U.S. laws affecting
    activities of U.S. companies doing business abroad,
    including tax laws and laws regulating various business
    practices, also impact our international business. Our
    international operating results may be influenced, when compared
    to our North American results, in part due to relative economic
    conditions in the European markets and due to competitive
    pricing pressures on certain products. The financial reporting
    of our consolidated operating results is affected by
    fluctuations



in currency exchange rates, which may present challenges in
    comparing operating performance from period to period and in
    forecasting future performance.

We have financial
    commitments and investments in financial assets, including
    assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial
    risk.

We have maintained investments in

available-for-sale

securities (including marketable and auction rate securities)
    and a number of private equity funds. Since there is no active
    trading market for investments in private equity funds, they are
    for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature,
    can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk,
    including financial leverage, than other financial investments.
    Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of
    the underlying investments or new information provided by
    private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of
    such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation. In
    addition, we have commitments that require us to contribute
    additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of
    a capital call from the private equity fund.

Product liability
    claims and other litigation could be costly.

We are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and direct
    claims for product liability, including putative class actions.
    Product liability claims can result in significant liability
    and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly to
    defend. Also, we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to
    provide us with products or components for products that we
    sell. As a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality
    of products or components sourced from other manufacturers, we
    are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products
    and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.

We have experienced putative class action lawsuits in recent
    years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations, product
    liability and wage and hour issues. We have generally denied
    liability and have vigorously defended these cases. However,
    even when there is no basis for imposing liability, such
    lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve due to their scope
    and complexity and the potentially significant exposure that is
    alleged.

Increasingly, homebuilders, including our customers, are subject
    to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary
    course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with
    these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify
    them against liability for the performance of our products or
    services or the performance of other products that we install.
    These claims, often asserted several years after completion of
    construction, frequently result in lawsuits against the
    homebuilders and many of their subcontractors, including us, and
    require us to incur defense costs even when our products or
    services are not the principal basis for the claims.

See Note U to the consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 of this Report for additional
    information about litigation involving our businesses.

Government and
    industry responses to environmental and health and safety
    concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating
    results.

Government regulations pertaining to health and safety
    (including protection of employees as well as consumers) and
    environmental concerns continue to emerge, domestically as well
    as internationally. In addition to having to comply with current
    requirements (including requirements that do not become
    effective until a future date), even more stringent requirements
    could be imposed on our industries in the future. Compliance
    with these regulations (such as the restrictions on lead content
    in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and
    formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our
    businesses) may require us to alter our manufacturing and
    installation processes and our sourcing. Such actions could
    adversely impact our operating results, and our ability to
    effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely
    impact our competitive position.



The long-term
    performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract,
    develop and retain talented management.

To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain highly
    qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing
    and product design and innovation and, as we consider entering
    new international markets, skilled personnel familiar with these
    markets. We compete with multinational firms for these employees
    and we invest significant resources in recruiting, developing,
    motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop,
    motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our
    competitive position and our operating results.

On February 10, 2009 there were approximately 6,000 holders
    of record of the Company’s common stock.

The Company expects that its practice of paying quarterly
    dividends on its common stock will continue, although the
    payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the
    Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon the
    Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial
    condition and other factors. Given the continued uncertainty in
    the global economic and financial markets, the Company will
    focus on liquidity preservation. As a result, the Company’s
    management is recommending to the Board of Directors that the
    quarterly dividend be reduced from $.235 per common share ($.94
    per common share annually) to $.075 per common share ($.30 per
    common share annually).

In July 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the purchase of up to 50 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock in open-market transactions or
    otherwise, replacing the May 2006 authorization. The Company
    continues to evaluate its share repurchase program in relation
    to its cash balances, cash flows and market conditions and has
    not repurchased any shares since July 2008 and does not
    anticipate further repurchases under current conditions.
    However, consistent with past practice, the Company anticipates
    repurchasing shares in 2009 to offset any dilution from
    long-term stock awards granted or stock options exercised as
    part of its compensation programs.

Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The financial and business analysis below provides information
    which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and
    understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis
    should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
    statements and related notes.

The following discussion and certain other sections of this
    Report contain statements reflecting the Company’s views
    about its future performance and constitute
    “forward-looking statements” under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve
    risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and,
    accordingly, the Company’s actual results may differ
    materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking
    statements. Readers should consider that various factors,
    including those discussed in Item 1A “Risk
    Factors” of this Report, the “Executive
    Level Overview,” “Critical Accounting Policies
    and Estimates” and “Outlook for the Company”
    sections, may affect the Company’s performance. The Company
    undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
    statements as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise.

Executive
    Level Overview

The Company manufactures, distributes and installs home
    improvement and building products. These products are sold to
    the home improvement and new home construction markets through
    mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, home
    builders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and
    contractors.

During 2008, the Company experienced a significant decline in
    its markets, including a decline in new home construction of
    over 30 percent from 2007, as well as a continued decline
    in consumer spending for home improvement products. The
    Company’s net sales decreased 17 percent in 2008 from
    2007 and the Company’s operating profit (as adjusted to
    exclude impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible
    assets, general corporate expense, net, gains on sale of fixed
    assets, net and 2008 charge for litigation settlement) declined
    to 7.2 percent of sales in 2008 from 11.7 percent of
    sales in 2007.

Factors that affect the Company’s results of operations
    include the levels of home improvement activity and new home
    construction principally in North America and Europe, the
    importance of and the Company’s relationships with key
    customers (including The Home Depot, which represented
    approximately 21 percent of the Company’s net sales in
    2008), the Company’s ability to maintain its leadership
    positions in its U.S. and global markets in the face of
    increasing competition and the Company’s ability to
    effectively manage its overall cost structure, including the
    cost and availability of labor and materials. If the current
    market conditions, including the rate of consumer spending for
    home improvement products and new home construction, continue or
    deteriorate further, the Company’s results of operations
    would continue to be negatively impacted. The Company cannot
    provide any assurances that current market conditions affecting
    the home improvement and new home construction markets will not
    deteriorate further and the Company cannot predict the timing or
    strength of a recovery in these markets. The Company’s
    International businesses face political, monetary, economic and
    other risks that vary from country to country, as well as
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Further, the Company
    has financial commitments and investments in financial assets
    that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk,
    particularly in the current uncertain economic and credit market
    conditions. In addition, product liability claims and other
    litigation could be costly. These and other factors are
    discussed in more detail in Item 1A “Risk
    Factors” of this Report.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial
    condition and results of operations are based upon the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have
    been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
    these financial statements requires the Company to make certain
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of



the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company regularly
    reviews its estimates and assumptions, which are based upon
    historical experience, as well as current economic conditions
    and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

The Company believes that the following critical accounting
    policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates
    used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition and Receivables

The Company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of
    loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered.
    The Company records revenue for unbilled services performed
    based upon estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and
    Other Services segment; such amounts are recorded in
    Receivables. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue
    for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special
    pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions
    and other volume-based incentives. Allowances for doubtful
    accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses
    resulting from the inability of customers to make required
    payments. In addition, the Company monitors its customer
    receivable balances and the credit worthiness of its customers
    on an on-going basis. During downturns in our markets, declines
    in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers
    impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and the
    Company has incurred additional bad debt expense related to
    customer defaults. The Company’s bad debt expense was
    $41 million, $29 million and $16 million at
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In North America, the Company manufactures products (principally
    windows, doors and cabinets) and provides installation of
    insulation and other services to homebuilders. The
    Company’s bad debt expense related to homebuilders was
    $28 million, $23 million and $8 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value, with expense estimates made for obsolescence or
    unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the
    recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value
    based upon assumptions about future demand and market
    conditions. On an on-going basis, the Company monitors these
    estimates and records adjustments for differences between
    estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results
    have not significantly deviated from those determined using
    these estimates.

Financial
    Investments

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,”
    (“SFAS No. 157”) for its financial assets
    and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as “the price
    that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    at the measurement date.” SFAS No. 157 further
    defines a fair value hierarchy for measurement and disclosure of
    the fair value of financial instruments, as follows:
    Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs as
    observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted
    market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs
    that are observable or can be corroborated by market data; and
    Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by
    little or no market activity and that are financial instruments
    whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments
    for which the determination of fair value requires significant
    management judgment or estimation.

Financial investments that are available to be traded on readily
    accessible stock exchanges (domestic or foreign) are considered
    to have active markets and have been valued using Level 1
    inputs. Financial



investments that are not available to be traded on a public
    market or have limited secondary markets, or contain provisions
    that limit the ability to sell the investment are considered to
    have inactive markets and have been valued using Level 2 or
    3 inputs. The Company incorporated credit risk into the
    valuations of financial instruments by estimating the likelihood
    of non-performance by the counterparty to the applicable
    transactions. The estimate included the length of time relative
    to the contract, financial condition of the counterparty and
    current market conditions. The criteria for estimating if a
    market was active or inactive were based on the individual facts
    and circumstances.

The Company has maintained investments in

available-for-sale

securities and a number of private equity funds, which
    aggregated $101 million and $138 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2008. Investments in

available-for-sale

securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains or
    losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of
    tax effect, through shareholders’ equity, as a component of
    other comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet. The fair value of the Company’s investments
    in

available-for-sale

securities is estimated using primarily Level 1 inputs. The
    fair value of the Company’s investment in Asahi Tec
    preferred stock is estimated using a discounted cash flow model
    (Level 3 input). If the Company changed the discount rate
    used in the fair value estimate by 100 basis points, the
    value of the Asahi Tec preferred stock would change by
    approximately four percent.

The Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an
    investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is
    deemed to be

other-than-temporary.

During 2008, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges of $31 million related to its investment in TriMas
    common stock and $1 million related to its investment in
    Asahi Tec common stock.

In the past, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate
    securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities
    that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or
    35 days. At December 31, 2008, the Company’s
    investment in auction rate securities was $22 million; the
    Company has not increased its investment in auction rate
    securities since 2007. The fair value of auction rate securities
    is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model (Level 3
    input). If the Company changed the discount rate used in the
    fair value estimate by 75 basis points, the value of the
    auction rate securities would change by approximately
    $1 million.

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments are carried at cost. It is not practicable
    for the Company to estimate a fair value because the private
    equity funds have no quoted market price and sufficient
    information is not readily available for the Company to utilize
    a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund.
    These investments are evaluated quarterly for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an
    event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.
    Impairment indicators the Company considers include the
    following: whether there has been a significant deterioration in
    earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a
    significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or
    technological environment; a significant adverse change in the
    general market condition or geographic area in which the
    investment operates; industry and sector performance; current
    equity and credit market conditions; and any bona fide offers to
    purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. The
    Company also considers specific adverse conditions related to
    the financial health of and business outlook for the fund,
    including industry and sector performance. The significant
    assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential

other-than-temporary

impairment include current economic conditions, market analysis
    for specific funds and performance indicators in the automotive
    and transportation, residential and commercial construction,
    bio-technology, health care and information technology sectors
    in which the applicable funds’ investments operate.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had investments in 17
    venture capital funds, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $33 million. The venture capital funds invest in

start-up

or
    smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the
    information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors.
    At December 31, 2008, the Company also has investments in
    29 buyout funds, with an aggregate carrying



value of $105 million. The buyout funds invest in
    later-stage, established businesses and, other than the
    Heartland Industrial Partners Fund (“Heartland Fund”)
    which is primarily in the automotive and transportation sector,
    no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector.

Since there is no active trading market for these investments,
    they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their
    nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business
    risk, including financial leverage, than other financial
    investments. The timing of distributions from the funds, which
    depends on particular events related to the underlying
    investments, as well as the funds’ schedules for making
    distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to
    predict. As a result, the amount of income that is recorded from
    these investments can vary substantially from quarter to
    quarter. Future changes in market conditions, the future
    performance of the underlying investments or new information
    provided by private equity fund managers could affect the
    recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized
    upon liquidation.

During 2008, as a result of the Company’s review of its
    private equity investments, the Company determined that the
    Heartland Fund was negatively impacted by the 2008 decline in
    North American automotive production and the expected continued
    decline in automotive production in 2009. In addition, five
    funds with limited exposure to the residential and commercial
    construction markets were negatively impacted by the 2008
    decline in housing starts and the expected continued decline in
    2009, as well as a slow-down in commercial construction; these
    conditions resulted in the impairment of certain investments
    within these five funds. During 2008, the Company recognized
    non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges aggregating
    $23 million related to these investments in private equity
    funds. Therefore, these six funds now have a carrying value of
    $43 million at December 31, 2008. If automotive
    production were to decline further than expected in 2009 or
    continue for a period of time at lower than normal historical
    production rates, the Heartland Fund could have an additional
    impairment charge in a range of $1-$5 million. The Company
    expects that a continued decline in the residential and
    commercial construction markets would not have a significant
    impact on the five private equity funds that recorded an
    impairment charge in 2008, as their remaining investments are
    diversified outside the residential and commercial construction
    sectors.

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair
    value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill
    or other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” in the fourth quarter of each year, or as events
    occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not
    reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
    amount, the Company completes the impairment testing of goodwill
    utilizing a discounted cash flow method. The Company selected
    the discounted cash flow methodology as the Company believes
    that it is comparable to what would be used by other market
    participants. The Company has defined its reporting units and
    completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating
    segment level, as defined by SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information.” The Company’s operating segments are
    reporting units that engage in business activities, for which
    discrete financial information, including five-year forecasts,
    are available.

Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method
    requires the Company to make significant estimates and
    assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows,
    market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The
    Company’s judgments are based upon historical experience,
    current market trends, consultations with external valuation
    specialists and other information. While the Company believes
    that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation
    methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions
    could result in different outcomes. In estimating future cash
    flows, the Company relies on internally generated five-year
    forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital
    expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term
    assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the
    five-year forecast. The Company generally develops these
    forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for
    existing products, planned timing of new product launches,
    estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for
    existing homes.



In 2008, for its reporting units that primarily sell to the new
    home construction market (including those in the Installation
    and Other Services segment), the Company utilized estimated
    housing starts growing from current levels to 1.55 million
    in 2013 (terminal growth year) and operating profit margins
    improving to approximate historical margins for those business
    units by 2013 (terminal growth year). The housing starts
    projections were obtained from independent industry sources and
    discounted by approximately ten percent. In 2007, the Company
    estimated housing starts growing from 1.0 million units in
    2008 to 1.75 million units in 2012 (terminal growth year).
    In 2008 and 2007, the Company generally utilized its weighted
    average cost of capital (discount rate) of approximately nine
    percent to discount the estimated cash flows. Due to the market
    conditions in 2008, the Company increased the discount rate for
    certain of its reporting units, based upon a review of the
    current risks impacting its businesses.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company estimated that future
    discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting units
    were greater than the carrying values. Any increases in
    estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the
    reported value of goodwill.

If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, the Company measures the possible goodwill impairment
    based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the
    reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities
    of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized
    intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair
    value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its
    assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An
    impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting
    unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of
    goodwill.

In 2008, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges for goodwill of $456 million ($438 million,
    after tax). The pre-tax impairment charges, related to three of
    the Company’s United Kingdom manufacturers and
    distributors, recorded in 2008 were as follows: Cabinets and
    Related Products segment – $59 million; Plumbing
    Products segment – $203 million; and Other
    Specialty Products segment – $143 million; these
    impairment charges reflect the anticipated long-term outlook for
    the reporting units, including declining demand for certain
    products, as well as decreased operating profit margins. The
    pre-tax impairment charge in the Installation and Other Services
    segment, related to a small installation service reporting unit
    in North America, was $51 million, and reflects a decline
    in the reporting unit’s anticipated long-term outlook.

A ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s reporting units at December 31, 2008 would
    have resulted in a Step Two Analysis and probable goodwill
    impairment for one reporting unit in the Cabinets and Related
    Products segment, one reporting unit in the Installation and
    Other Services segment and one reporting unit in the Other
    Specialty Products segment.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events
    occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be
    impaired without regard to the reporting unit. The Company
    considers the implications of both external (e.g., market
    growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal
    (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and
    their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible
    asset in both the near- and long-term. In 2008, the Company
    recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets of $11 million
    ($7 million, after tax). The pre-tax impairment charges
    recorded in 2008 were as follows: Installation and Other
    Services segment – $1 million, and Other
    Specialty Products segment – $10 million.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the
    remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible
    assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and
    circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of
    amortization.



Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) provides for the issuance of stock-based
    incentives in various forms to employees and non-employee
    Directors. At December 31, 2008, outstanding stock-based
    incentives were in the form of long-term stock awards, stock
    options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights.

The Company elected to begin recording expense for stock options
    granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2003.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,”
    (“SFAS No. 123R”) using the Modified
    Prospective Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method
    requires the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock
    options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through
    the remaining vesting periods. The MPA method did not require
    the restatement of prior-year information. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut
    method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
    options as of the date of adoption.

Long-Term Stock
    Awards

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and
    non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share
    dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of
    repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open
    market. The Company measures compensation expense for stock
    awards at the market price of the Company’s common stock at
    the grant date. There was $155 million (eight million
    common shares) of total unrecognized compensation expense
    related to unvested stock awards at December 31, 2008,
    which was included as a reduction of common stock and retained
    earnings. Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is being
    recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the
    stock awards, typically 10 years (except for stock awards
    held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five
    years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes
    retirement-eligible at age 65. For stock awards granted
    prior to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized
    over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically
    10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will
    become, retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the
    expense is being recognized over five years, or immediately upon
    a grantee’s retirement. Pre-tax compensation expense for
    the annual vesting of long-term stock awards was
    $43 million for 2008.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market
    price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date.
    These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over
    five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
    grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant
    date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration
    stock options, except for restoration options resulting from
    options granted under the Company’s previous plan.
    Restoration stock options become exercisable six months from the
    date of grant.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock options
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is
    being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of
    time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123.
    For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, such
    expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of
    the stock options, typically five years. Pre-tax compensation
    expense for stock options was $36 million for 2008.

The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    assumptions for 2008: risk-free interest rate – 3.25%,
    dividend yield – 4.96%, volatility factor –
    32.00% and expected option life – 6 years. For
    SFAS No. 123R calculation purposes, the



weighted average grant-date fair value of option shares,
    including restoration options, granted in 2008 was $3.72 per
    option share.

If the Company increased its assumptions for the risk-free
    interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the
    expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in
    2008 would increase 64 percent. If the Company decreased
    its assumptions for the risk-free interest rate and the
    volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the
    fair value of stock options granted in 2008 would decrease
    69 percent.

Employee
    Retirement Plans

Accounting for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating
    the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon
    vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the
    time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations
    of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent
    in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation,
    expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation
    increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses. The
    Company considers current market conditions, including changes
    in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in
    assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension
    costs and obligations within the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In 2008, the Company decreased its discount rate for obligations
    to an average of 6.10 percent from 6.25 percent. The
    discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected
    duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities
    matched to the December 31, 2008 Citigroup Pension Discount
    Curve. Such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension
    plans ranged from 7.50 percent to 2.25 percent, with
    the most significant portion of the liabilities having a
    discount rate for obligations of 6.00 percent or higher.
    The assumed asset return was primarily 8.00 percent,
    reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.

The Company’s net underfunded amount for its qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans, the difference between the
    projected benefit obligation and plan assets, increased to
    $344 million at December 31, 2008 from
    $114 million at December 31, 2007, primarily due to a
    decline in asset values; in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
    132(R),” (“SFAS No. 158”), the
    underfunded amount has been recognized on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007.
    Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2008 had a net loss of
    approximately 33 percent compared to average losses of
    25 percent for the corporate funds universe within the
    Independent Consultant Cooperative.

The Company’s projected benefit obligation for its unfunded
    non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans was
    $147 million at December 31, 2008 compared with
    $138 million at December 31, 2007; in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158, the unfunded amount has been recognized
    on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007.

The Company expects pension expense for its qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans to be $49 million in 2009
    compared with $14 million in 2008. If the Company assumed
    that the future return on plan assets was one-half percent lower
    than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by
    50 basis points, the 2009 pension expense would increase by
    $7 million. The Company expects pension expense for its
    non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be
    $12 million in 2009 compared with $13 million in 2008.

Given the significant market decline in asset values for the
    Company’s qualified defined benefit pension plans, the
    Company has several funding options and credits available and
    anticipates that it will be required to increase its funding to
    meet ERISA requirements by between $16 million and
    $35 million in 2009.



Income
    Taxes

The Company has considered potential sources of future taxable
    income in determining the amount of a valuation allowance
    against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008.
    Should the Company determine that it would not be able to
    realize its deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to
    the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such
    determination is made. The need to maintain a valuation
    allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater
    volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.

Historically, the Company established reserves for tax
    contingencies in accordance with SFAS 5, “Accounting
    for Contingencies,” (“SFAS No. 5”).
    Under this standard, reserves for tax contingencies were
    established when it was probable that an additional tax may be
    owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In July 2006,
    the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109,”
    (“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48 allows
    the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a
    greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon
    examination by the taxing authorities. The adoption of
    FIN No. 48 was effective January 1, 2007.

FIN No. 48 establishes a lower threshold than
    SFAS No. 5 for recognizing reserves for income tax
    contingencies on uncertain tax positions (referred to by
    FIN No. 48 as “unrecognized tax benefits”).
    Therefore, the Company believes that there is a greater
    potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this
    lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and
    the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial
    number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits
    computation to a greater degree than with SFAS No. 5.

While the Company believes it has adequately provided for its
    uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities
    could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits. Accordingly, additional provisions for tax-related
    matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in
    income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or
    the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.

Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Certain of the Company’s products and product finishes and
    services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in
    material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to
    the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any
    changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
    servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted
    accordingly.

The majority of the Company’s business is at the consumer
    retail level through home centers and major retailers. A
    consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
    warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not
    distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when
    they claim a return deduction from the Company. The
    Company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account
    this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are
    recorded at the time of sale.

The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary
    course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these
    matters require estimates and judgments based upon the
    professional knowledge and experience of management and its
    legal counsel. When estimates of the Company’s exposure for
    lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for
    recognition under SFAS No. 5, amounts are recorded as
    charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such
    exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent
    developments. See Note U to the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements for information regarding certain legal
    proceedings involving the Company.



Corporate
    Development Strategy

In past years, acquisitions have enabled the Company to build
    strong positions in the markets it serves and have increased the
    Company’s importance to its customers. The Company’s
    more recent focus includes the rationalization of its business
    units, including consolidations, as well as pursuing synergies
    among the Company’s business units. The Company expects to
    maintain a more balanced growth strategy with emphasis on
    organic growth and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on
    cash flow and return on invested capital. As part of its
    strategic planning, the Company continues to review all of its
    businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to the
    Company’s long-term growth strategy.

During 2008, the Company determined that several European
    business units were not core to the Company’s long-term
    growth strategy and, accordingly, embarked on a plan of
    disposition. In separate transactions, the Company completed the
    sale of three business units in Europe, including two in the
    Plumbing Products segment and one in the Other Specialty
    Products segment. The Company recorded an impairment of assets
    related to these discontinued operations which primarily
    included the write-down of goodwill of $24 million and
    other assets of $21 million. The Company recognized a net
    gain of $3 million in 2008, primarily related to the 2008
    discontinued operations.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the
    Company accounted for the business units which were sold in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, as discontinued operations. There were no
    businesses held for sale at December 31, 2008. See
    Note B to the consolidated financial statements for more
    information.

During 2008, the Company acquired a relatively small countertop
    business (Cabinet and Related Products segment). This business,
    which allows the Company to expand the products and services it
    offers to its customers, had annual sales of over
    $40 million. The results of this acquisition are included
    in the consolidated financial statements from the date of
    acquisition. The aggregate net purchase price for this
    acquisition was $20 million and included cash of
    $18 million and future cash payments of $2 million.

During 2007, the Company acquired several relatively small
    installation service businesses (Installation and Other Services
    segment), as well as Erickson Construction Company and Guy
    Evans, Inc. (Installation and Other Services segment). The
    results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated
    financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through
    cash provided by a combination of its operations, long-term bank
    debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by
    the issuance of Company common stock, including issuances for
    certain mergers and acquisitions.

Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the
    Company’s financial strategies. The Company’s total
    debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to
    58 percent at December 31, 2008 from 50 percent
    at December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily due to the
    decline in shareholders’ equity due to share repurchases,
    the decline in the fair value of pension assets, the effect of
    currency translation and the net loss (including impairment
    charges for goodwill and other intangible assets) in 2008.

Bank credit lines are maintained to provide for the availability
    of funds. At December 31, 2008, the Company had a
    $2.0 billion Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement with a
    group of banks syndicated in the United States and
    internationally, which expires in February 2011. This agreement
    allows for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars or
    European euros with interest payable based upon various
    floating-rate options as selected by the Company. At
    December 31, 2008, there are no amounts outstanding under
    the Five-Year Revolving Credit facility and there are no current
    plans to utilize this facility. In light of the recent financial
    market turmoil, the Company has confirmed with JPMorgan Chase
    Bank, the agent for this facility, that the obligations of
    Merrill Lynch and Wachovia Bank, as participating lenders under
    this facility, have been assumed by Bank of America and Wells
    Fargo Bank, respectively, in



connection with the completion of the transactions to combine
    these entities. Both Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank were
    already participating lenders under the Company’s credit
    facility.

The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, contains
    limitations on additional borrowings, related to the debt to
    total capitalization requirements; at December 31, 2008,
    the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to
    availability, of up to $284 million. The Five-Year
    Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a requirement for
    maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31,
    2008, the Company’s net worth exceeded such requirement by
    $29 million. Based on the credit agreement, the net worth
    covenant is adjusted on an annual basis. On a pro forma basis,
    as of January 1, 2009, the Company’s net worth,
    including the minority interest reclassification of
    $135 million (upon adoption of SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial
    Statements – an Amendment of ARB No. 51,”)
    would have exceeded the requirement by approximately
    $980 million. In addition, at January 1, 2009, the
    Company could borrow approximately $480 million or absorb a
    reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately
    $300 million and remain in compliance with the debt to
    total capitalization covenant.

In order to borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit
    Agreement, there must not be any defaults in the Company’s
    covenants in the credit agreement (i.e., in addition to the two
    financial covenants, principally limitations on subsidiary debt,
    negative pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and
    maintenance of insurance) and the Company’s representations
    and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all
    material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no
    material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a
    material adverse change, in each case since December 31,
    2003, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance and no
    material tax deficiency). The Company was in compliance with all
    debt covenants at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

A credit rating agency (i.e., Moody’s or Standard and
    Poor’s) is an entity that assigns credit ratings for
    issuers of certain types of debt obligations. In December 2008,
    one rating agency reduced the credit rating on the
    Company’s debt to below investment grade. As a result, the
    Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes (“Notes”) are
    convertible on demand and the balance of $54 million has
    been classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2008.
    The Company does not anticipate conversion of the Notes since,
    based on the terms, it would not currently be profitable for
    holders of the Notes to exercise the option to convert the
    Notes. Also, as a result of the downgrade, the costs related to
    the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will be higher.

As a result of the general deterioration in global economic and
    financial market conditions, as well as the lowering of the
    Company’s credit ratings, it may become difficult to obtain
    financing to fund operations or to refinance the Company’s
    existing debt obligations.

The Company had cash and cash investments of $1 billion at
    December 31, 2008 principally as a result of strong cash
    flows from operations.

The Company’s cash and cash investments consist of
    overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit
    accounts, money market mutual funds containing government
    securities and treasury obligations. While the Company attempts
    to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize
    risk, it is possible that the recent global turmoil in the
    financial markets could result in failures of additional
    financial institutions or other events and thereby affect the
    security or availability of these investments.

The Company has maintained investments in

available-for-sale

and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds,
    principally as part of its tax planning strategies, as any gains
    enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax
    losses. The Company determined that the longer maturity of
    private equity funds would be advantageous to the Company and
    complement the Company’s investment in more liquid

available-for-sale

and marketable securities to balance risk. Since the Company has
    significantly reduced its capital tax losses in part by
    generating capital gains from investments and other sources, the
    Company has and will continue to reduce its investments in
    long-term financial assets.



In 2008, the Company increased its quarterly common stock
    dividend two percent to $.235 per common share. Given the
    continued uncertainty in the global economic and financial
    markets, the Company will focus on liquidity preservation. As a
    result, the Company’s management is recommending to the
    Board of Directors that the quarterly dividend be reduced from
    $.235 per common share ($.94 per common share annually) to $.075
    per common share ($.30 per common share annually).

During 2008, the Company retired $100 million of
    5.75% notes due October 15, 2008, the scheduled
    maturity date. The Company has no further scheduled maturities
    of its long-term indebtedness until March 2010 when
    $300 million of its Floating Rate Notes become due.

The Company’s working capital ratio was 2.1 to 1 and 2.0 to
    1 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

During 2004, the Company entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements for the purpose of effectively converting a portion
    of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. In 2008, the Company
    terminated these interest rate swap agreements covering a
    notional amount of $850 million of the Company’s
    fixed-rate debt due July 15, 2012 with an interest rate of
    5.875%, and received cash of $16 million. These swap
    agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges and were
    considered 100 percent effective. The gain of
    $16 million from the termination of these swaps is being
    amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining
    term of the debt, through July 2012.

The Company, including certain European operations, has entered
    into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to
    currency fluctuations, primarily related to the European euro
    and the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2008, the Company
    had also entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to
    hedge currency fluctuations related to intercompany loans
    denominated in non-functional currencies.

The Company’s cash and cash investments increased
    $106 million to $1,028 million at December 31,
    2008, from $922 million at December 31, 2007.



Net cash provided by operations of $797 million consisted
    primarily of net (loss) adjusted for non-cash and certain other
    items, including depreciation and amortization expense of
    $238 million, net loss on disposition of businesses of
    $38 million, a $467 million charge for the impairment
    of goodwill and other intangible assets, a $58 million
    charge for the impairment of financial investments and other
    non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense,
    amortization expense related to in-store displays and interest
    expense on the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes, as well as
    a net decrease in working capital of $161 million.

The Company continues to emphasize balance sheet management,
    including working capital management and cash flow generation.
    Days sales in accounts receivable were 50 days at
    December 31, 2008 compared with 49 days at
    December 31, 2007, and days sales in inventories were
    48 days at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. Accounts
    payable days were 43 days at both December 31, 2008
    and 2007. Working capital (defined as accounts receivable and
    inventories less accounts payable) as a percent of sales was
    14.7 percent and 15.4 percent at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Net cash used for financing activities was $632 million,
    and included cash outflows of $336 million for cash
    dividends paid, $133 million for the retirement of notes
    and $160 million for the acquisition and retirement of nine
    million shares of Company common stock in open-market
    transactions.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had remaining Board of
    Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to an additional
    32 million shares of its common stock in open-market
    transactions or otherwise. The Company continues to evaluate the
    requirements for reinvestment in the business, working capital,
    common stock dividends and common stock repurchases in relation
    to its cash balances, cash flows, financial resources and
    financial market conditions. The Company believes that its
    present cash balance and cash flows from operations are
    sufficient to fund its near-term working capital and other
    investment needs. The Company believes that its longer-term
    working capital and other general corporate requirements will be
    satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent
    necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market
    activities. Further, in connection with this review, given the
    turmoil in the financial markets and challenging new home
    construction and home improvement markets, the Company has not
    repurchased any shares since July 2008 and does not anticipate
    further repurchases under current conditions. However,
    consistent with past practice, the Company anticipates
    repurchasing shares in 2009 to offset any dilution from
    long-term stock awards granted or stock options exercised as
    part of its compensation programs.

Net cash used for investing activities was $13 million, and
    included $200 million for capital expenditures and
    $21 million for acquisitions. Cash provided by investing
    activities included primarily $179 million of net proceeds
    from the disposition of businesses and $58 million from the
    net sale of financial investments.

The Company invests in automating its manufacturing operations
    to increase its productivity to improve customer service and to
    support new product innovation. Capital expenditures for 2008
    were $200 million, compared with $248 million for 2007
    and $388 million for 2006; for 2009, capital expenditures,
    excluding any potential 2009 acquisitions, are expected to
    approximate $175 million. Depreciation and amortization
    expense for 2008 totaled $238 million, compared with
    $248 million for 2007 and $244 million for 2006; for
    2009, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any
    potential 2009 acquisitions, is expected to approximate
    $230 million. Amortization expense totaled
    $17 million, $20 million and $14 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with
    existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor,
    in the opinion of the Company, are they expected to have, a
    material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures,
    financial position or results of operations.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in
    the United States. However, the Company believes that certain
    non-GAAP



performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business,
    may provide users of this financial information with additional
    meaningful comparisons between current results and results in
    prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should
    be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the
    Company’s reported results.

Sales and
    Operations

Net sales for 2008 were $9.6 billion, representing a
    decrease of 17 percent from 2007. Excluding results from
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales
    decreased 18 percent compared with 2007. The following
    table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions:

Net sales for 2008 were adversely affected by an accelerating
    decline in the new home construction market, which reduced sales
    volume by approximately ten percent compared to 2007. Economic
    conditions remain difficult in the new home construction market
    as full-year 2008 housing starts have declined over
    30 percent to 900,000 from 2007. Net sales for 2008 were
    also negatively affected by a continued decline in consumer
    spending for home improvement products, which contributed to
    lower sales volume, reducing net sales by approximately six
    percent compared to 2007. Such declines were partially offset by
    net selling price increases of approximately one percent
    compared to 2007.

The Company’s International operations have also been
    adversely affected by global deterioration in consumer spending
    for home improvement products and new home construction. Net
    sales volume of the Company’s International products
    declined in local currencies and reduced consolidated net sales
    by approximately three percent compared to 2007. A weaker
    U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of
    local currencies of European operations and increased sales by
    one percent compared to 2007.

The Company’s gross profit margins were 24.8 percent,
    27.3 percent and 27.5 percent in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The decrease in the 2008 and 2007 gross
    profit margins reflects declining sales volume and the related
    under-absorption of costs, which more than offset net selling
    price increases and the benefits associated with the
    Company’s business rationalizations and other initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
    sales were 19.1 percent in 2008 compared with
    17.2 percent in 2007 and 16.1 percent in 2006.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
    sales in 2008 reflect lower sales volume and increased bad debt
    and litigation expense, as well as increased plant closure
    costs. The year 2007 includes increased severance costs,
    increased bad debt expense and increased system implementation
    costs, which, on a combined basis, increased $36 million or
    .3 percent of sales compared to 2006.

Operating profit in 2008, 2007 and 2006 includes
    $83 million, $79 million and $47 million,
    respectively, of costs and charges related to the Company’s
    business rationalizations and other initiatives. Operating
    profit in 2008, 2007 and 2006 includes $467 million,
    $119 million and $317 million, respectively, of
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets.
    Operating profit in 2008 and 2006 includes $(9) million and
    $1 million of (charges) income regarding the Masco
    Contractor Services and Behr litigation settlements,
    respectively. Operating profit margins, as reported, were
    .8 percent, 9.1 percent and 8.9 percent



in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating profit margins,
    excluding the items above, were 6.6 percent,
    10.9 percent and 11.8 percent in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Operating profit margins in 2008 were adversely affected by an
    accelerating decline in new home construction and a continued
    decline in consumer spending in North American and International
    markets, both of which negatively impacted the sales volume in
    each of the Company’s segments and negatively impacted
    operating profit margins by approximately two percentage points
    compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in 2007 were
    adversely affected by a continuing decline in new home
    construction and a moderation in consumer spending in North
    America, both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of
    installation and other services, cabinets and windows and doors;
    such sales volume declines negatively impacted operating profit
    margin by approximately two percentage points compared to 2006.
    Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by an
    accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a
    moderation in consumer spending for certain “big
    ticket” home improvement items, such as cabinets, in the
    last half of 2006, as well as the continuing negative impact of
    higher commodity costs partially offset by certain selling price
    increases.

Other Income
    (Expense), Net

During 2008 the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges aggregating $58 million primarily related to
    financial investments in TriMas common stock ($31 million),
    Asahi Tec common stock ($1 million), private equity funds
    ($23 million) and other investments ($3 million).

Other, net, for 2008 included $3 million of realized
    losses, net, from the sale of marketable securities and
    $4 million of income from other investments, net. Other,
    net, for 2008 also included realized currency losses of
    $31 million and other miscellaneous items.

During 2007, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges aggregating $22 million related to financial
    investments in Furniture Brands International common stock
    ($6 million), Asahi Tec common stock ($3 million),
    auction rate securities ($3 million) and private equity
    funds ($10 million).

Other, net, for 2007 included $5 million of realized gains,
    net, from the sale of marketable securities, $6 million of
    dividend income and $38 million of income from other
    investments, net. Other, net, for 2007 also included
    $9 million of realized currency gains and other
    miscellaneous items.

During 2006, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges aggregating $101 million for its investments
    related to Metaldyne ($40 million), TriMas
    ($16 million), the Heartland fund ($29 million) and
    other funds ($16 million).

Other, net, for 2006 included $4 million of realized gains,
    net, from the sale of marketable securities, $10 million of
    dividend income and $30 million of income from other
    investments, net. Other, net, for 2006 also included realized
    currency gains of $14 million and other miscellaneous items.

Interest expense was $228 million, $258 million and
    $240 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    decrease in interest expense in 2008 is primarily due to lower
    interest rates and the retirement of higher fixed-rate debt in
    2007 and 2008. The increase in interest expense in 2007 is
    primarily due to increasing interest rates and the issuance of
    higher interest rate debt of 6.125% notes in October 2006
    and floating-rate notes and 5.85% notes in March 2007.
    These debt issuances were in consideration of the 2007 debt
    payments.

(Loss) Income
    and (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing
    Operations

(Loss) income and diluted (loss) earnings per common share from
    continuing operations for 2008 were $(382) million and
    $(1.08) per common share, respectively. Income and diluted
    earnings per common share from continuing operations for
    2007 were $494 million and $1.32 per common share,
    respectively. Income and diluted earnings per common share from
    continuing operations for 2006 were $458 million and $1.15
    per common share, respectively. (Loss) income from continuing
    operations for



2008 included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill
    and other intangible assets of $467 million
    ($445 million or $1.26 per common share, after tax). Income
    from continuing operations for 2007 included non-cash, pre-tax
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of
    $119 million ($100 million or $.27 per common share,
    after tax). Income from continuing operations for 2006 included
    non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill of
    $317 million ($317 million or $.79 per common share,
    after tax).

The Company’s effective tax rate for the loss from
    continuing operations was 63 percent in 2008 and for income
    from continuing operations was 39 percent and
    46 percent in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    Company’s effective tax rate for income from continuing
    operations, excluding the impairment charges for goodwill and
    other intangible assets, was 60 percent, 36 percent
    and 34 percent in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    increase in the effective tax rate for 2008 reflects the
    additional U.S. tax on a repatriation of low-taxed earnings
    from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to utilize the
    Company’s foreign tax credit carryforward by
    December 31, 2008, combined with a decrease in the
    Company’s 2008 pre-tax income.

Outlook for the
    Company

Business conditions remain difficult in the Company’s
    markets. The Company experienced a further significant reduction
    in sales of its products and services in the fourth quarter of
    2008, which has continued into early 2009. Housing starts
    declined over 30 percent to 900,000 in 2008 from 2007. The
    Company estimates that 2009 housing starts will decline
    approximately 35 percent to a range of 550,000 to
    600,000 units. The Company anticipates that consumer
    spending for home improvement products and demand for certain of
    the Company’s International products will continue to
    decline in the near-term.

Although the Company is confident that the long-term
    fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement
    markets are positive, the Company expects that market conditions
    will be extremely challenging over the next several quarters,
    given the continued uncertainty in the global economic and
    financial markets. Accordingly, the Company will focus on
    liquidity preservation to ensure its ability to fund its
    business operations, growth opportunities that may arise and a
    relatively modest debt maturity due in early 2010.

The Company believes that its financial position (including cash
    of over $1 billion at December 31, 2008, and its
    ability to generate cash flow) together with its current
    strategy of investing in leadership brands, innovative growth
    and flexible and scalable supply chains, will allow the Company
    to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.

Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business
    Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general
    corporate expense, net, gains on sale of corporate fixed assets,
    net, (charge) income regarding litigation settlements, and
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in
    2008, 2007 and 2006.

Business
    Rationalizations and Other Initiatives

Over the past several years, the Company has been focused on the
    strategic rationalization of its businesses, including business
    consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system
    implementations and other initiatives. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company incurred net costs and
    charges of $83 million pre-tax related to these
    initiatives. Based on current plans, the Company anticipates
    costs and charges related to the Company’s business
    rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate
    $44 million in 2009. The Company continues to evaluate its
    businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs
    based on changes in the Company’s markets which could
    result in further costs and charges.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company incurred
    net costs and charges of $79 million related to business
    rationalizations, net of an $8 million gain from the sale
    of fixed assets. During 2006, the Company incurred
    $39 million pre-tax of costs and charges (primarily
    accelerated depreciation and severance expense) related to a
    plant closure and other profit improvement programs in the
    Plumbing Products segment. In addition, in 2006, the Company
    incurred $8 million pre-tax of costs and charges (including
    the write-down of inventories and accelerated depreciation)
    related to the closure of a relatively small ready-to-assemble
    cabinet manufacturing facility in the Cabinets and Related
    Products segment.

Cabinets and
    Related Products

Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased in 2008
    primarily due to a decline in sales volume of cabinets in the
    new home construction market and lower sales volume of cabinets
    in the North American retail market, as well as a less favorable
    product mix, which combined to reduce sales in this segment by
    approximately 16 percent compared to 2007. Net sales in
    this segment were also negatively impacted by lower local
    currency sales volume of International operations, which reduced
    sales in this segment by approximately five percent compared to
    2007. Net sales in this segment decreased in 2007 primarily due
    to a decline in sales volume of cabinets in the new home
    construction market, which reduced sales in this segment by
    11 percent compared to 2006. A decline in net sales of
    ready-to-assemble cabinets reduced sales in this segment by five
    percent in 2007 compared to 2006. A weaker U.S. dollar had
    a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of
    International operations included in this segment and increased
    sales by one percent in 2008 compared to 2007 and increased
    sales by two percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Net sales in this
    segment in 2006 were affected primarily by lower sales of
    ready-to-assemble cabinets in North America and Europe, which
    more than offset certain selling price increases and sales
    volume increases of assembled cabinets in North America in the
    first half of 2006.

Operating profit margins in the Cabinets and Related Products
    segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume
    and the related under-absorption of fixed costs and a less
    favorable product mix which reduced operating profit margins by
    approximately six percentage points compared to 2007, as well as
    increased plant closure and system implementation costs. In
    2008, operating profit margins were also negatively affected by
    lower results of International operations included in this
    segment, which reduced operating profit margins by approximately
    two percentage points compared to 2007. In 2007, operating
    profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by the
    decline in sales volume, which reduced operating profit margins
    by approximately three percentage points, as well as increased

start-up

costs and the under-utilization of two new plants in this
    segment, and increased severance costs. Such declines were
    partially offset by a gain on the sale of a manufacturing
    facility of $8 million and benefits associated with
    business rationalizations and other initiatives. In 2006,
    operating



profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by a
    decline in sales volume in the last half of the year, as well as
    increased commodity, freight and plant

start-up

costs and lower results of International operations, offset in
    part by selling price increases. In 2006, operating profit
    margins in this segment were also negatively affected by
    $8 million of costs and charges related to the closure of a
    relatively small ready-to-assemble cabinet manufacturing
    facility.

Plumbing
    Products

Net sales of Plumbing Products decreased in 2008 primarily due
    to lower sales volume to North American retailers and
    wholesalers, which reduced sales by approximately ten percent
    compared to 2007. Reflecting the weakened global economy, net
    sales in this segment were also negatively impacted by lower
    local currency sales volume of International operations, which
    reduced sales in this segment by approximately four percent
    compared to 2007. Such declines were partially offset by net
    selling price increases, which increased sales by approximately
    three percent compared to 2007. Net sales in this segment
    increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to increased sales
    volume of certain International operations, which increased
    sales in this segment by three percent in 2007 compared to 2006.
    In 2007, increased selling prices also increased sales in this
    segment by three percent compared to 2006. These results were
    partially offset by declining sales volume to North American
    retail and wholesale customers, which reduced sales in this
    segment by four percent in 2007 compared to 2006. A weaker
    U.S. dollar also had a positive effect on the translation
    of local currencies of International operations included in this
    segment and increased sales by two percent in 2008 compared to
    2007 and increased sales by four percent in 2007 compared to
    2006.

Operating profit margins in the Plumbing Products segment in
    2008 were negatively affected by the decline in North American
    and International sales volume, which reduced operating profit
    margins by approximately one percentage point compared to 2007.
    Such declines were partially offset by net selling price
    increases. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2007 were
    negatively affected by increased commodity costs in early 2007,
    which reduced operating profit margins by approximately two
    percentage points compared to 2006. Such declines were offset by
    selling price increases and the reduction of certain variable
    expenses, as well as lower rationalization costs. In 2006,
    operating profit margins in this segment were negatively
    affected by increased commodity costs, as well as a less
    favorable product mix and declining sales volume to certain
    retail customers.

Installation
    and Other Services

Net sales of Installation and Other Services decreased in 2008
    primarily due to significantly lower sales volume related to the
    accelerating decline in the new home construction market which
    declined over 30 percent in 2008 compared to 2007, as well
    as lower selling prices (related to material price decreases).
    Net sales in this segment decreased in 2007 primarily due to
    lower sales volume related to the continued slowdown in the new
    home construction market, which reduced sales in this segment by
    20 percent compared to 2006 and declines in selling prices,
    partially offset by acquisitions which increased sales in this
    segment by six percent compared to 2006. Net sales in this
    segment in 2006 were affected primarily by increased sales
    volume of non-insulation products and selling price increases in
    the first half of 2006.

Operating profit margins in the Installation and Other Services
    segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume
    and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, as well as
    decreased selling prices and increased bad debt expense, which
    decreased operating profit margins by approximately seven
    percentage points. Such declines were partially offset by
    material price decreases. Operating profit margins in this
    segment were lower in 2007 primarily due to lower sales volume
    and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, which decreased
    operating profit margins in this segment by approximately three
    percentage points compared to 2006, and lower selling prices.
    The year 2007 also included increased bad debt expense,
    increased severance and location closure costs and increased
    system implementation expenses, which, on a combined basis,
    reduced operating profit margin in this segment by one
    percentage point compared to 2006. Partially offsetting these
    declines were



reductions in material costs, as well as benefits associated
    with the business rationalizations and other initiatives. In
    2006, the operating profit margins in this segment reflect
    increased sales volume of generally lower-margin, non-insulation
    products, as well as operating costs to support the
    segment’s growth in non-insulation products, new product
    development and technology initiatives.

The Installation and Other Services segment continues to
    rationalize its footprint and portfolio of products.

Decorative
    Architectural Products

Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products decreased in
    2008, primarily due to lower retail sales volume of paints and
    stains and builders’ hardware, which more than offset
    selling price increases. Net sales in this segment increased in
    2007 primarily due to higher retail sales volume from new
    product introductions of paints and stains, which increased
    sales in this segment by four percent compared to 2006, which
    was partially offset by sales declines related to builder’s
    hardware. Net sales in this segment in 2006 were affected
    primarily by selling price increases of paints and stains.

Operating profit margins in the Decorative Architectural
    Products segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales
    volume of paints and stains and builders’ hardware,
    increasing material costs throughout 2008 and program costs for
    builders’ hardware, which more than offset the effect of
    selling price increases. Operating profit margins in this
    segment in 2007 primarily reflect increased sales volume of
    paints and stains, offset by increased advertising expenses. In
    2006, operating profit margins in this segment reflect increased
    selling prices of paints and stains, which partially offset
    commodity cost increases experienced in late 2004 and during
    2005.

Other
    Specialty Products

Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased primarily due to
    lower sales volume of windows and doors, resulting from the
    accelerating decline in the new home construction market, as
    well as a decline in the home improvement market in this
    segment, particularly in the Western United States, which
    decreased sales in this segment by approximately 18 percent
    in 2008 compared to 2007 and approximately 14 percent in
    2007 compared to 2006. Net sales in this segment were also
    negatively impacted by lower local currency sales volume of
    International operations, which reduced sales in this segment by
    approximately two percent compared to 2007, due to the decline
    in the United Kingdom markets. A stronger U.S. dollar,
    particularly in the fourth quarter, had a negative effect on the
    translation of local currencies of International operations
    included in this segment and decreased sales by one percent in
    2008 compared to 2007 and a weaker U.S. dollar increased
    sales by two percent in 2007 compared to 2006.

Operating profit margins in the Other Specialty Products segment
    in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the
    related under-absorption of fixed costs, which decreased
    operating profit margins by approximately seven percentage
    points compared to 2007, as well as increased plant closure
    costs. Operating profit margins were also negatively affected by
    lower results of International operations, which reduced
    operating profit margins by approximately two percentage points
    compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in this segment
    declined in 2007 due to lower sales volume of windows and doors
    in the new home construction market, which decreased operating
    profit margins by approximately three percentage points compared
    to 2006, and lower results of International operations, which
    reduced operating profit margins by approximately two percentage
    points compared to 2006. Operating profit margins in this
    segment in 2006 reflected lower sales volume of windows and
    doors, which offset improved International operating results.



Geographic Area
    Results Discussion

North
    America

Net sales from North American operations decreased in 2008 and
    2007 primarily due to the accelerating decline in the new home
    construction market and the continued decline in consumer
    spending for home improvement products. North American net sales
    in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of
    installation and other services, cabinets and windows and doors
    in the new home construction market which decreased sales from
    North American operations by approximately 13 percent in
    2008 compared to 2007. In addition, North American net sales
    were negatively affected by lower retail sales volume of
    cabinets, plumbing products, paints and stains and
    builder’s hardware, which aggregated to a net decrease in
    North American sales of approximately eight percent in 2008
    compared to 2007. North American sales in 2007 were negatively
    affected by lower sales volume of installation and other
    services, cabinets and windows and doors in the new home
    construction market which decreased sales from North American
    operations by 11 percent compared to 2006. In addition,
    North American net sales were negatively affected by lower
    retail sales volume of certain products, partially offset by
    increased retail sales volume of paint and stains, which
    aggregated a net decrease to sales from North American
    operations of one percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Net sales
    from North American operations in 2006 reflect relatively
    stronger market conditions in the first half of 2006, as well as
    increased selling prices.

The declines in operating profit margins from North American
    operations in 2008 and 2007 are primarily due to accelerating
    declines in new home construction and consumer spending, which
    negatively impacted the sales volume of the Company’s
    products and decreased operating profit margins by approximately
    three percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007 and
    approximately two percentage points in 2007 compared to 2006.
    The declines in 2007 were partially offset by selling price
    increases, and the benefits associated with the Company’s
    business rationalizations and other initiatives. In 2006, the
    operating profit margins from North American operations
    reflected sales volume declines in the second half of 2006 of
    ready-to-assemble cabinets, windows and doors and the
    installation of insulation products, as well as increased
    commodity costs, partially offset by selling price increases.

International,
    Principally Europe

Net sales from International operations decreased in 2008
    primarily due to lower sales volume of plumbing products and
    cabinets, which reduced sales from International operations in
    local currencies by approximately 13 percent compared to
    2007. Such declines were partially offset by selling price
    increases, which increased sales from International operations
    by approximately two percent compared to 2007. Net sales from
    International operations increased in 2007 primarily due to
    increased sales volume of plumbing products which increased
    sales from International operations in local currencies by five
    percent compared to 2006. A weaker U.S. dollar had a
    positive effect on the translation of International results in
    2008 and 2007, increasing International net sales by three
    percent in 2008 compared to 2007 and ten percent in 2007
    compared to 2006. Net sales from International operations in
    2006 reflect increased sales of plumbing products, as well as a
    weaker U.S. dollar which had a positive effect on the
    translation of European results.

Operating profit margins in 2008 were negatively affected by
    lower sales volumes and the related under-absorption of fixed
    costs, as well as increased severance and plant closure costs.
    Operating profit margins in 2007 were negatively affected by a
    less favorable product mix and material cost increases.
    Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by the
    lower operating results for European ready-to-assemble cabinets,
    which more than offset the positive effect of increased sales
    volume of plumbing products and improved operating results of
    other European operations.



Other
    Matters

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

Information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company is
    set forth in Note U to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Other
    Commitments

With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity
    funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2008, commitments
    to contribute up to $42 million of additional capital to
    such funds, representing the Company’s aggregate capital
    commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to
    date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional
    capital contributions to these private equity funds upon receipt
    of a capital call from the private equity fund. The Company has
    no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital
    calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in
    the carrying value of the Company’s investment in the
    private equity fund when paid.

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and
    customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries
    in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims made
    against builders by homeowners for issues relating to the
    Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with
    divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally
    provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to
    various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks;
    legal and environmental issues; and provisions for sales
    returns. The Company has never had to pay a material amount
    related to these indemnifications, and evaluates the probability
    that amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an
    estimated liability when probable.

Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of
    future cash outflows associated with unrecognized tax benefits,
    the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate for the
    period beyond the next year in which cash settlements may occur
    with applicable tax authorities.

Recently Issued
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 was effective January 1,
    2008 for financial assets and liabilities. In February 2008, the
    FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,”

(“FSP No. 157-2”).

FSP No. 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 related to
    non-financial assets and liabilities to January 1, 2009. In
    October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset is Not Active,” (“FSP

No. 157-3”).

FSP No. 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 to financial
    assets in a market that is not active and provides an example to
    illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a
    financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not
    active. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial
    assets and liabilities did not have a significant effect on the
    consolidated financial statements and the Company does not
    anticipate that the adoption of this pronouncement for
    non-financial assets and liabilities will have a significant
    effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160
    requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties
    other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled,



and presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a component
    of shareholders’ equity. SFAS No. 160 is
    effective January 1, 2009, and requires the amount of
    consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the consolidated statement of income.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS No. 141R
    requires that the acquisition method be applied to all business
    combinations and it establishes requirements for the recognition
    and measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities by the
    acquiring company. Further, it requires that costs incurred to
    complete any acquisition be recognized as expense in the
    consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 141R also
    requires that contingent assets and liabilities be recorded at
    fair value and marked to market quarterly until they are
    settled, with any changes to the fair value to be recorded as
    income or expense in the consolidated statement of income.
    SFAS No. 141R is effective for the Company, for any
    business combination that is completed subsequent to
    January 1, 2009.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” (“SFAS No. 161”).
    SFAS No. 161 changes the disclosure requirements for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 161 is effective January 1, 2009 and the
    Company does not anticipate that this pronouncement will have a
    significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement),” (“FSP APB

14-1”).

FSP APB

14-1

requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that permit or
    require the issuer to pay cash upon conversion to separately
    account for the liability and equity components. The adoption of
    FSP APB

14-1

is effective January 1, 2009 and retrospective application
    is required. The adoption of FSP APB

14-1

will
    result in the Company recognizing $1 million as a
    cumulative effect of accounting change, net as of
    January 1, 2007. The Company has determined that the
    adoption of FSP APB

14-1

would
    reduce basic and diluted (loss) earnings per common share from
    continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting
    change, net by $.05 per common share for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, and would have no impact for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions are Participating Securities,”
    (“FSP

EITF 03-6-1”).

FSP

EITF 03-6-1

requires that the Company’s unvested share-based payment
    awards containing non-forfeited rights to dividends be included
    in the computation of earnings per common share. The adoption of
    FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective January 1, 2009 and retrospective application
    is required. The Company has determined that the impact of the
    adoption of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

would (increase) decrease basic (loss) income from continuing
    operations before cumulative effect of accounting change, net
    and net (loss) income by $(.02) and $(.03) per common share,
    $.03 and $.03 per common share and $.02 and $.03 per common
    share, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006. The Company has also determined that the impact
    of the adoption of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

would (increase) decrease diluted (loss) income from continuing
    operations before cumulative effect of accounting change, net
    and net (loss) income by $(.02) and $(.03) per common share,
    $.02 and $.01 per common share and $.02 and $.02 per common
    share, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 132R-1,

“Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets,” (“FSP

FAS 132R-1”).

FSP

FAS 132R-1

expands the disclosures related to postretirement benefit plan
    assets to include disclosures concerning the Company’s
    investment policies for benefit plan assets and categories of
    plan assets. FSP

FAS 132R-1

further expands the disclosure requirements to include fair
    value measurements of plan assets, including the levels within
    the fair value hierarchy and other related disclosures under
    SFAS No. 157 and any concentrations of risk related to
    the plan assets. The adoption of FSP

FAS 132R-1

is effective for the year ended December 31, 2009, and the
    Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this
    pronouncement will have a significant effect on its consolidated
    financial statements and disclosures.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting
    Release No. 48, “Disclosure of Accounting Policies for
    Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity
    Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative
    Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial
    Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative
    Commodity Instruments”.

The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest
    rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course
    of business and to market price fluctuations related to its
    marketable securities and other investments. The Company has
    limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and
    uses such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure
    to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency
    fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information regarding the
    Company’s derivative instruments.

The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 consist of two interest rate swap
    agreements entered into in 2004 for the purpose of effectively
    converting a portion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt;
    in October 2008, the Company terminated the two interest rate
    swap agreements. The Company, including certain European
    operations, also entered into foreign currency forward contracts
    to manage exposure to currency fluctuations related primarily to
    the European euro and the U.S. dollar. At December 31,
    2008, the Company had also entered into foreign currency
    exchange contracts to hedge currency fluctuations related to
    intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies.

At December 31, 2008, the Company performed sensitivity
    analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of
    market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical
    change of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates or
    a 10 percent decline in the market value of the
    Company’s long-term investments. Based upon the analyses
    performed, such changes would not be expected to materially
    affect the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Masco Corporation is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Masco Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

The management of Masco Corporation assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2008 using the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in “Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework.” Based on this assessment, management has
    determined that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, performed an audit of the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of
    Masco Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008. Their report expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Masco
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008 and expressed an unqualified opinion
    on the Company’s 2008 consolidated financial statements.
    This report appears under Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data under the heading Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Masco Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Masco
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note S to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    unrecognized tax benefits in 2007. As discussed in Note N
    to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
    its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in 2006.
    As discussed in Note O to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans effective
    December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Masco Corporation
    and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
    consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations
    of variable interest entities, for which the Company is the
    primary beneficiary, in accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 46 – Revised, “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities.”

Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of
    Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to
    make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
    these estimates and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue
    as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to
    customers or when services are rendered, net of applicable
    provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. The Company
    records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon
    estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other
    Services segment; such amounts are recorded in receivables.
    Amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in net
    sales, while costs incurred for shipping and handling are
    included in cost of sales.

Customer Promotion Costs.

The Company records
    estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and
    incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative
    advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based
    incentives. In-store displays that are owned by the Company and
    used to market the Company’s products are included in other
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized
    using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of
    three years; related amortization expense is classified as a
    selling expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Foreign Currency.

The financial statements of the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local
    currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
    these subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates as of the
    balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at
    average exchange rates in effect during the year. The resulting
    cumulative translation adjustments have been recorded in the
    accumulated other comprehensive income component of
    shareholders’ equity. Realized foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of
    income in other income (expense), net.

Cash and Cash Investments.

The Company considers all
    highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three
    months or less to be cash and cash investments.

Receivables.

The Company does significant business
    with a number of customers, including certain home centers and
    homebuilders. The Company monitors its exposure for credit
    losses on its customer receivable balances and the credit
    worthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis and records
    related allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are
    estimated based upon specific customer balances, where a risk of
    default has been identified, and also include a provision for
    non-customer specific defaults based upon historical collection,
    return and write-off activity. During downturns in the
    Company’s markets, declines in the financial condition and
    creditworthiness of customers impacts the credit risk of the
    receivables involved and the Company has incurred additional bad
    debt expense related to customer defaults. A separate allowance
    is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally
    based upon sales activity. Receivables are presented net of
    certain allowances (including allowances for doubtful accounts)
    of $75 million and $85 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Receivables include unbilled
    revenue related to the Installation and Other Services segment
    of $24 million and $31 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment,
    including significant betterments to existing facilities, are
    recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal, the cost and
    accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any
    gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of
    income. Maintenance and repair costs are charged against
    earnings as incurred.

The Company reviews its property and equipment in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”.
    SFAS No. 144 requires the Company to evaluate property
    and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that
    would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property
    and equipment below the carrying amount. If the carrying amount
    of property and equipment is not recoverable from its
    undiscounted cash flows, then the Company would recognize an
    impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount
    and the current fair value. Further, the Company evaluates the
    remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each
    reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances
    warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense is computed
    principally using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets. Annual depreciation rates are as
    follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10 percent,
    and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation
    expense was $220 million, $215 million and
    $218 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.

SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” requires goodwill and other
    intangible assets to be tested for impairment annually and under
    certain circumstances. The Company performs such testing of
    goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur
    or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce
    the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
    The Company has defined its reporting units and completed the
    impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level,
    as defined by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” The
    Company’s operating segments are reporting units that
    engage in business activities, for which discrete financial
    information, including five-year forecasts, are available. The
    Company compares the fair value of the reporting units to the
    carrying value of the reporting units for goodwill impairment
    testing. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow
    method.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or
    as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets
    may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit. The
    Company considers the implications of both external (e.g.,
    market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and
    internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth)
    factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the
    intangible asset in both the near- and long-term.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using
    the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The
    Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable
    identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to
    determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to
    the remaining periods of amortization. See Note I for
    additional information regarding Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Derivative
    Instruments.

On January 1, 2008, the Company
    adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” (“SFAS No. 157”) for its
    financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as “the price
    that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Continued)

participants at the measurement date.”
    SFAS No. 157 further defines a fair value hierarchy
    for measurement and disclosure of the fair value for financial
    instruments, as follows: Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2
    inputs as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such
    as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    market data; and Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that
    are supported by little or no market activity and that are
    financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing
    models or instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation.

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is determined
    at each balance sheet date and future declines in market
    conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments
    or new information could affect the recorded values of the
    Company’s investments in marketable securities and private
    equity funds.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage
    certain exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows
    resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
    interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability
    measured at fair value. For each derivative financial instrument
    that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge, the gain
    or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting
    loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk,
    are recognized in determining current earnings during the period
    of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments not
    designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is
    recognized in determining current earnings during the period of
    the change in fair value. See Notes F and G for additional
    information.

Warranty.

At the time of sale, the Company accrues a
    warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products,
    parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction
    of warranty obligations. The Company’s estimate of costs to
    service its warranty obligations is based upon historical
    experience and expectations of future conditions.

A significant portion of the Company’s business is at the
    consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers.
    A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
    warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not
    distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when
    they claim a return deduction from the Company. The
    Company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account
    this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are
    recorded at the time of sale.

Product Liability.

The Company provides for expenses
    associated with product liability obligations when such amounts
    are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are
    adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change
    that would effect the estimated liability.

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company elected to
    change its method of accounting for stock-based compensation and
    implemented the fair value method prescribed by
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation,” effective January 1, 2003. The Company
    used the prospective method, as defined by
    SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation – Transition and Disclosure –
    an amendment to SFAS No. 123,” for determining
    stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, options granted,
    modified or settled subsequent to January 1, 2003 have been
    accounted for using the fair value method and options granted
    prior to January 1, 2003 were accounted for using the
    intrinsic value method.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,”
    (“SFAS No. 123R”) using the Modified
    Prospective Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method
    requires the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock
    options that were awarded prior to

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Continued)

January 1, 2003 through the remaining vesting periods. The
    MPA method did not require the restatement of prior-year
    information. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the
    Company utilized the shortcut method to determine the tax
    windfall pool associated with stock options as of the date of
    adoption.

Interest and Penalties on Unrecognized Tax
    Benefits.

The Company records interest and penalties on
    its unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior-year amounts have
    been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation in the
    consolidated financial statements. The results of operations
    related to 2008, 2007 and 2006 discontinued operations have been
    reclassified and separately stated in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income for 2008, 2007 and 2006. In
    the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, the
    cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately
    classified.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In
    September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 was effective January 1,
    2008 for financial assets and liabilities. In February 2008, the
    FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,”
    (“FSP

No. 157-2”).

FSP

No. 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 related to
    non-financial assets and liabilities to January 1, 2009. In
    October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset is Not Active,” (“FSP

No. 157-3”).

FSP

No. 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 to financial
    assets in a market that is not active and provides an example to
    illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a
    financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not
    active. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial
    assets and liabilities did not have a significant effect on the
    consolidated financial statements and the Company does not
    anticipate that the adoption of this pronouncement for
    non-financial assets and liabilities will have a significant
    effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160
    requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties
    other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and
    presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a component of
    shareholders’ equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective
    January 1, 2009, and requires the amount of consolidated
    net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling
    interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the
    consolidated statement of income.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS No. 141R
    requires that the acquisition method be applied to all business
    combinations and it establishes requirements for the recognition
    and measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities by the
    acquiring company. Further, it requires that costs incurred to
    complete any acquisition be recognized as expense in the
    consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 141R also
    requires that contingent assets and liabilities be recorded at
    fair value and marked to market quarterly until they are
    settled, with any changes to the fair value to be recorded as
    income or expense in the consolidated statement of income.
    SFAS No. 141R is effective, for the Company, for any
    business combination that is completed subsequent to
    January 1, 2009.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” (“SFAS No. 161”).
    SFAS No. 161 changes the disclosure requirements for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 161 is effective January 1, 2009 and the
    Company does not anticipate that this pronouncement will have a
    significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

SFAS No. 144 addresses the accounting and reporting
    for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
    SFAS No. 144 broadens the presentation of discontinued
    operations to include a component of the Company, which
    comprises operations and cash flows, that can be clearly
    distinguished from the rest of the Company. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, the Company has accounted for the
    business units which were sold in 2008, 2007 and 2006, except as
    noted, as discontinued operations.

During 2008, the Company determined that several European
    business units were not core to the Company’s long-term
    growth strategy and, accordingly, embarked on a plan of
    disposition (“2008 Plan”). In separate transactions,
    the Company completed the sale of its European-based The Heating
    Group business unit (Other Specialty Products segment), Glass
    Idromassaggio (Plumbing Products segment) and Alfred Reinecke
    (Plumbing Products segment), as part of the Company’s 2008
    Plan. Total net proceeds from the sale of these business units
    were $174 million. The Company recorded an

    OPERATIONS – (Continued)

impairment of assets related to these discontinued operations
    which primarily included the write-down of goodwill of
    $24 million and other assets of $21 million; upon
    completion of the transactions, the Company recognized a net
    gain of $6 million included in gain (loss) on disposal of
    discontinued operations. During 2008, the Company recorded other
    net expenses of $3 million included in gain (loss) on
    disposal of discontinued operations, net, reflecting the
    adjustment of certain liabilities related to businesses disposed
    in prior years.

During 2007, the Company completed the sale of Avocet, a
    European business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products
    segment. This disposition was completed pursuant to the
    Company’s determination that this business unit was not
    core to the Company’s long-term growth strategy. Total
    gross proceeds from the sale were $41 million; the Company
    recognized a pre-tax net loss on the disposition of Avocet of
    $11 million. During 2007, the Company recorded other net
    gains of $1 million, reflecting the receipt of additional
    purchase price payments related to businesses disposed in 2006
    and 2005.

During 2006, the Company completed the sale of Computerized
    Security Systems (“CSS”), a North American business
    unit in the Other Specialty Products segment. This disposition
    was completed pursuant to the Company’s determination that
    this business unit was not core to the Company’s long-term
    growth strategy. Total gross proceeds from the sale were
    $92 million; the Company recognized a pre-tax net gain on
    the disposition of CSS of $51 million. During 2006, the
    Company recorded additional net expenses of $1 million,
    reflecting the final purchase price payments related to
    businesses disposed in 2005.

(Losses) gains from these 2008, 2007 and 2006 discontinued
    operations discussed above were included in (loss) income from
    discontinued operations, net, in the consolidated statements of
    income.

The after-tax charge for the impairment of assets held for sale

    December 31, 2008. Included in income tax above was income
    tax expense related to income (loss) from discontinued
    operations of $1 million, $3 million and
    $10 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income
    (loss) from discontinued operations also includes non-cash,
    pre-tax and after tax impairment charges for goodwill of
    $108 million and $14 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The unusual relationship between income taxes and
    (loss) income before income taxes (excluding the impairment
    charge for assets held for sale) resulted primarily from certain
    losses providing no current tax benefit and from certain gains
    and income not being subject to income taxes.

During 2007, the Company completed the sale of two small
    businesses, the results of which were included in continuing
    operations through the dates of sale. These small businesses in

During 2006, the Company completed the sale of several
    relatively small businesses, the results of which were included
    in continuing operations in the Other Specialty Products and
    Plumbing Products segments through the dates of sale. These
    businesses had combined net sales and operating profit of
    $16 million and $5 million, respectively, in 2006
    through the respective dates of sale. Gross proceeds from the
    sale of these businesses were $72 million; the Company
    recognized a net gain of $1 million in 2006 included in
    other, net, in continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

ACQUISITIONS

During 2008, the Company acquired a relatively small countertop
    business (Cabinet and Related Products segment). This business,
    which allows the Company to expand the products and services it
    offers to its customers, had annual sales of over
    $40 million. The results of this acquisition are included
    in the consolidated financial statements from the date of
    acquisition.

During 2007, the Company acquired several relatively small
    installation service businesses (Installation and Other Services
    segment), as well as Erickson Construction Company and Guy
    Evans, Inc. (Installation and Other Services segment). The
    results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated
    financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.

During 2006, the Company acquired several relatively small
    businesses (primarily in the Installation and Other Services
    segment). The results of these acquisitions are included in the
    consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of
    acquisition.

    additional consideration payable in cash of $10 million,
    contingent upon the operating performance of the acquired
    businesses; at December 31, 2008, there was no outstanding
    contingent consideration.

    INVESTMENTS

The Company has maintained investments in available-for-sale
    securities and a number of private equity funds, principally as
    part of its tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the
    utilization of any current and future tax capital losses.
    Financial investments included in other assets were as follows,

Investments in marketable securities are accounted for as
    available-for-sale. Accordingly, the Company records these
    investments at fair value, and unrealized gains or losses (that
    are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect,
    through shareholders’ equity, as a component of other
    comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and charges for
    other-than-temporary impairments are included in determining net
    income, with related purchase costs based upon specific
    identification.

For available-for-sale securities, the Company reviews industry
    analyst reports, key ratios and statistics, market analyses and
    other factors for each investment to determine if an unrealized
    loss is other-than-temporary. Based upon this review, during
    2008, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges of $31 million related to its investment in TriMas
    Corporation (“TriMas”) common stock (NYSE: TRS) and
    $1 million related to its investment in Asahi Tec
    Corporation (“Asahi Tec”) common stock (Tokyo Stock
    Exchange: 5606.T). Based upon this review, in 2007, the Company
    recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of
    $6 million related to its investment in Furniture Brands
    International common stock (NYSE: FBN) and $3 million
    related to its investment in Asahi Tec common stock.

In the past, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate
    securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities
    that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or
    35 days. During 2007, the



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

E. FINANCIAL
    INVESTMENTS – (Continued)

Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of
    $3 million related to auction rate securities.

On January 11, 2007, the acquisition of Metaldyne
    Corporation (“Metaldyne”) (formerly MascoTech, Inc.)
    by Asahi Tec, a Japanese automotive supplier, was finalized. The
    combined fair value of the Asahi Tec common and preferred stock,
    as well as the derivative related to the conversion feature on
    the preferred stock, received in exchange for the Company’s
    investment in Metaldyne, was $72 million. The Asahi Tec
    common and preferred stock are restricted from sale for up to
    24 months from the transaction date. The preferred stock
    accrues dividends at an annual rate of 3.75%

pay-in-kind

or 1.75% cash at the discretion of Asahi Tec; the Company has
    elected to record such dividends when cash proceeds are
    received. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized
    a gain of $14 million, net of transaction fees, included in
    the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, in income from other investments,
    net.

Subsequent to the transaction, the Company’s investment in
    Asahi Tec common and preferred stock is accounted for as
    available-for-sale and unrealized gains or losses, that are
    deemed to be temporary, related to the change in fair value of
    the Asahi Tec common and preferred stock at December 31,
    2008 and 2007 have been recognized, net of tax, through
    shareholders’ equity, as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    unrealized loss of $2 million and $17 million,
    respectively, related to the change in fair value of the
    derivative related to the conversion feature on the preferred
    stock, has been included in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of income, in income from other investments, net. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had a net investment in
    Asahi Tec of $73 million, including $73 million of
    common and preferred stock; the conversion derivative was valued
    at zero. The increase in the investment in Asahi Tec in 2008 is
    due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the
    Japanese yen.

In addition, immediately prior to its sale, Metaldyne
    distributed shares of TriMas common stock as a dividend to the
    holders of Metaldyne common stock; the Company recognized income
    of $4 million included in the Company’s consolidated
    statement of income, in dividend income from other investments
    for the year ended December 31, 2007. In May 2007, TriMas
    made an initial public offering; subsequent to the offering, the
    Company’s investment in TriMas is accounted for as
    available-for-sale and unrealized gains or losses, that are
    deemed to be temporary, related to the change in fair value of
    the investment have been recognized, net of tax, through
    shareholders’ equity, as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet.

The Company’s investments in available-for-sale securities
    at December 31, 2008 (including marketable securities,
    auction rate securities, Asahi Tec common and preferred stock
    and TriMas common stock) were as follows, in millions:

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments are carried at cost. It is not practicable
    for the Company to estimate a fair value because the private
    equity funds have no quoted market price and sufficient
    information is not readily available for the Company to utilize
    a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund.
    These investments are evaluated quarterly for potential
    other-than-temporary impairment when impairment indicators are
    present, or when an event or change in circumstances has
    occurred, that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair
    value of



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

E. FINANCIAL
    INVESTMENTS – (Continued)

the investment. Impairment indicators the Company considers
    include the following: whether there has been a significant
    deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business
    prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory,
    economic or technological environment; a significant adverse
    change in the general market condition or geographic area in
    which the investment operates; industry and sector performance;
    current equity and credit market conditions; and any bona fide
    offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying
    value. The Company also considers specific adverse conditions
    related to the financial health of and business outlook for the
    fund, including industry and sector performance. The significant
    assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential
    other-than-temporary impairment include current economic
    conditions, market analysis for specific funds and performance
    indicators in the automotive and transportation, residential and
    commercial construction, bio-technology, health care and
    information technology sectors in which the applicable
    funds’ investments operate. Since there is no active
    trading market for these investments, they are for the most part
    illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also have a
    relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial
    leverage, than other financial investments. Future changes in
    market conditions, the future performance of the underlying
    investments or new information provided by private equity fund
    managers could affect the recorded values of such investments
    and the amounts realized upon liquidation.

At December 31, 2008, the Company has investments in 17
    venture capital funds, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $33 million. The venture capital funds invest in

start-up

or
    smaller, early-stage established businesses, principally in the
    information technology, bio-technology and health care sectors.
    At December 31, 2008, the Company also has investments in
    29 buyout funds, with an aggregate carrying value of
    $105 million. The buyout funds invest in later-stage,
    established businesses and, other than the Heartland Industrial
    Partners Fund (“Heartland Fund”), which is primarily
    in the automotive and transportation sector, no buyout fund has
    a concentration in a particular sector.

During 2008, the Company determined that the decline in the
    estimated value of certain private equity fund investments, with
    an aggregate carrying value of $66 million prior to the
    impairment, was other-than-temporary. A review of sector
    performance and other factors specific to the underlying
    investments in six funds having other-than-temporary declines in
    fair value, including the Heartland Fund (automotive and
    transportation sector of $10 million) and five other funds
    ($13 million.) Accordingly, for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company recognized non-cash pre-tax
    impairment charges aggregating $23 million.

During 2007, the Company determined that the decline in the
    estimated value of certain private equity fund investments, with
    an aggregate carrying value of $54 million prior to the
    impairment, was other-than-temporary. Accordingly, for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized non-cash,
    pre-tax impairment charges of $10 million.

During 2006, based upon a review of new information from the
    Heartland Fund concerning fund investments and the continued
    deterioration of conditions in the automotive and transportation
    sector served by Metaldyne and TriMas, the Company determined
    that the decline in the estimated value of certain of its
    financial investments was other-than-temporary. Accordingly, in
    2006, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges aggregating $88 million for its investments in
    Metaldyne ($40 million), TriMas ($16 million), the
    Heartland Fund ($29 million) and another fund
    ($3 million) which invested in automotive and
    transportation-related suppliers, including Metaldyne and
    TriMas. Additionally, based upon the Company’s review, the
    Company considered the decline in the fair value of certain of
    its other private equity fund investments and other investments
    to be other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized
    non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of $13 million in 2006.

The remaining private equity investments in 2008 and 2007 with

    $119 million, respectively, were not reviewed for
    impairment, as there were no indicators of impairment or
    identified events or changes in circumstances that would have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.
    At December 31, 2008, the Company has $26 million,
    $5 million and $2 million invested in venture capital
    funds associated with the information technology, healthcare and
    biotechnology sectors, respectively. A continued decline in
    those sectors could result in a future evaluation for

F. DERIVATIVES

At December 31, 2008, the Company had entered into foreign
    currency exchange contracts to hedge currency fluctuations
    related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional
    currencies with notional amounts of $161 million. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had recorded a
    $16 million loss on



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

F. DERIVATIVES – (Concluded)

the foreign currency exchange contract, which is more than
    offset by gains related to the translation of loans and accounts
    denominated in non-functional currencies.

At December 31, 2008, the Company, including certain
    European operations, also had entered into foreign currency
    forward contracts with notional amounts of $31 million and
    $14 million to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in
    the European euro and the U.S. dollar, respectively. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company, including certain European
    operations, had entered into foreign currency forward contracts
    with notional amounts of $23 million, $7 million and
    $4 million to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in
    the European euro, the Great Britain pound and the
    U.S. dollar, respectively. Based upon year-end market
    prices, the Company had recorded a $2 million gain to
    reflect the favorable contract prices at December 31, 2008
    and no asset or liability was recorded at December 31,
    2007, as the forward prices were substantially the same as the
    contract prices. Gains (losses) related to these contracts are
    recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of income
    in other income (expense), net. In the event that the
    counterparties fail to meet the terms of the foreign currency
    forward contracts, the Company’s exposure is limited to the
    aggregate foreign currency rate differential with such
    institutions.

During 2004, the Company entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements for the purpose of effectively converting a portion
    of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. In 2008, the Company
    terminated these interest rate swap agreements covering a
    notional amount of $850 million of the Company’s
    fixed-rate debt due July 15, 2012 with an interest rate of
    5.875%, and received cash of $16 million. These swap
    agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges and were
    considered 100 percent effective. The gain of
    $16 million from the termination of these swaps is being
    amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining
    term of the debt, through July 2012.

During 2003, the Company entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements for the purpose of effectively converting a portion
    of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. In 2004, the Company
    terminated these interest rate swaps relating to
    $850 million of fixed-rate debt. These swap agreements were
    accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain of approximately
    $45 million from the termination of these swaps is being
    amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining
    term of the debt, through July 2012.

In 2008, the Company recognized a decrease in interest expense
    of $12 million related to the interest rate swap
    agreements. In 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized an increase
    in interest expense of $3 million and $8 million,
    respectively, related to these swap agreements, due to
    increasing interest rates.

G. FAIR
    VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157 for its financial assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair
    value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date.”
    SFAS No. 157 further defines a fair value hierarchy,
    as follows: Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs
    as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as
    quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other
    inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market
    data; and Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or
    instruments for which the determination of fair value requires
    significant management judgment or estimation.

FAIR VALUE OF
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – (Continued)

Financial investments that are available to be traded on readily
    accessible stock exchanges (domestic or foreign) are considered
    to have active markets and have been valued using Level 1
    inputs. Financial investments that are not available to be
    traded on a public market or have limited secondary markets, or
    contain provisions that limit the ability to sell the investment
    are considered to have inactive markets and have been valued
    using Level 2 or 3 inputs. The Company incorporated credit
    risk into the valuations of financial investments by estimating
    the likelihood of non-performance by the counterparty to the
    applicable transactions. The estimate included the length of
    time relative to the contract, financial condition of the
    counterparty and current market conditions. The criteria for
    estimating if a market was active or inactive were based on the
    individual facts and circumstances.

Financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a

The preferred stock of Asahi Tec has been valued primarily using
    a discounted cash flow model, because there are currently no
    observable prices in an active market for the same or similar
    securities. The significant inputs in the discounted cash flow
    model used to value the Asahi Tec preferred stock include: the
    present value of future dividends, present value of redemption
    rights, fair value of conversion rights and the discount rate
    based on credit spreads for Japanese-issued preferred securities.

The fair values of the auction rate securities held by the
    Company have been estimated using a discounted cash flow model
    (Level 3 input). The significant inputs in the discounted
    cash flow model used to value the auction rate securities
    include: expected maturity of auction rate securities, discount
    rate used to determine the present value of expected cash flows
    and assumptions for credit defaults, since the auction rate
    securities are backed by credit default swap agreements.

The Company also has investments in private equity funds and
    other private investments which are carried at cost and are
    evaluated for potential impairment when impairment indicators
    are present, or when an event or change in circumstances has
    occurred, that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair
    value of the investment. There is no active trading market for
    these investments and they are for the most part illiquid. Due
    to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value
    measurements used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3
    input.

Financial investments measured at fair value on a non-recurring
    basis during the period and the amounts for each level within

    ended December 31, 2008.

The fair value of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate debt
    instruments is based principally upon quoted market prices for
    the same or similar issues or the current rates available to the

(A)

Additions include acquisitions.

(B)

During 2008, the Company reclassified the goodwill related to
    the business units held for sale. Subsequent to the
    reclassification, the Company recognized a charge for those
    business units expected to be divested at a loss; the charge
    included a write-down of goodwill of $24 million.

(C)

Other principally includes the effect of foreign currency
    translation and purchase price adjustments related to prior-year
    acquisitions.

In the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2007, the Company completed
    its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the year, there were
    no changes in events or circumstances that would have indicated
    potential impairment.

The impairment test indicated that goodwill recorded for certain
    of the Company’s reporting units was impaired. The Company
    recognized the non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill
    of $456 million ($438 million, after tax) and
    $177 million ($177 million, after tax) for 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The pre-tax impairment charge recognized in
    2008, in the Cabinets and Related Products, Plumbing Products
    and Other Specialty Products segments, related to three of the
    Company’s United Kingdom manufacturers and distributors; in
    the Installation and Other Services segment, the charge related
    to a small installation service business in North America. The
    pre-tax impairment charge recognized in 2007, in the Other
    Specialty Products segment, related to the Company’s
    European manufacturer of heating products; in the Plumbing
    Products segment the charge related to a North American
    manufacturer of plumbing-related products. The impairment
    charges in 2008 and 2007 reflect the anticipated long-term
    outlook for the reporting units, including declining demand for
    certain products, as well as decreased operating profit margins.

Other indefinite-lived intangible assets were $195 million
    and $208 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, and principally included registered trademarks. In
    2008, the impairment test indicated that the registered
    trademark for a small installation service business in North
    America in the Installation and Other Services segment and the
    registered trademark for a North American business unit in the
    Other Specialty Products segment were impaired due to changes in
    the anticipated long-term outlook for the business units,
    particularly in the new home construction market. In 2007, the
    impairment test indicated that the registered trademark for a
    North American business unit in the Other Specialty Products
    segment was impaired due to changes in the long-term outlook for
    the business unit, particularly in the new home construction
    market. The Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment

charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets of
    $11 million ($7 million, after tax) and
    $50 million ($31 million, after tax) in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

The carrying value of the Company’s definite-lived
    intangible assets was $104 million at December 31,
    2008 (net of accumulated amortization of $56 million) and
    $115 million at December 31, 2007 (net of accumulated
    amortization of $67 million) and principally included
    customer relationships and non-compete agreements, with a
    weighted average amortization period of 15 years and
    14 years in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2007, the
    Company increased its definite-lived intangible assets by
    $69 million primarily related to the acquisitions of
    Erickson Construction Company and Guy Evans, Inc. Amortization
    expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets was
    $16 million, $15 million and $10 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, amortization expense related to the
    definite-lived intangible assets during each of the next five
    years was as follows: 2009 – $12 million;
    2010 – $11 million; 2011 –
    $10 million; 2012 – $10 million; and
    2013 – $9 million.

DEBT – (Continued)

The Company retired $100 million of 5.75% notes on
    October 15, 2008, the scheduled maturity date.

In July 2001, the Company issued $1.9 billion principal
    amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
    2031 (“Old Notes”), resulting in gross proceeds of
    $750 million. The issue price per Note was $394.45 per
    $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented a yield
    to maturity of 3.125% compounded semi-annually. In December
    2004, the Company completed an exchange of the outstanding Old
    Notes for Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes Series B due
    July 2031 (“New Notes” or “Notes”). The
    Company will not pay interest in cash on the Notes prior to
    maturity, except in certain circumstances, including possible
    contingent interest payments that are not expected to be
    material. Holders of the Notes have the option to require that
    the Notes be repurchased by the Company on July 20, 2011
    and every five years thereafter. Upon conversion of the Notes,
    the Company will pay the principal return, equal to the lesser
    of (1) the accreted value of the Notes in only cash, and
    (2) the conversion value, as defined, which will be settled
    in cash or shares of Company common stock, or a combination of
    both, at the option of the Company. The Notes are convertible if
    the average price of Company common stock for the 20 days
    immediately prior to the conversion date exceeds


/


%,
    declining by


/


%
    each year thereafter, of the accreted value of the Notes divided
    by the conversion rate of 12.7317 shares for each $1,000
    principal amount at maturity of the Notes. Notes also become
    convertible if the Company’s credit rating is reduced to
    below investment grade, or if certain actions are taken by the
    Company. The Company may at any time redeem all or part of the
    Notes at their then accreted value.

A credit rating agency (i.e., Moody’s or Standard and
    Poor’s) is an entity that assigns credit ratings for
    issuers of certain types of debt obligations. In December 2008,
    one rating agency reduced the credit rating on the
    Company’s debt to below investment grade. As a result, the
    Notes are convertible on demand and the balance of
    $54 million has been classified as short-term debt at
    December 31, 2008. The Company does not anticipate
    conversion of the Notes since, based on the terms, it would not
    currently be profitable for holders of the Notes to exercise the
    option to convert the Notes.

On January 20, 2007, holders of $1.8 billion
    (94 percent) principal amount at maturity of the Notes
    required the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash value
    of $825 million. As a result of this repurchase, a
    $93 million deferred income tax liability was paid in 2007.
    At both December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were outstanding
    $108 million principal amount at maturity of Notes, with an
    accreted value of $54 million and $52 million,
    respectively, which has been reclassified to short-term debt at
    December 31, 2008 and had been included in long-term debt
    at December 31, 2007.

During 2007, the Company also retired $300 million of
    floating-rate notes due March 9, 2007 and $300 million
    of 4.625% notes due August 15, 2007. On March 14,
    2007, the Company issued $300 million of floating-rate
    notes due 2010; the interest rate is determined based upon the
    three-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points. On March 14,
    2007, the Company also issued $300 million of fixed-rate
    5.85% notes due 2017. These debt issuances provided net
    proceeds of $596 million and were in consideration of the
    March and August 2007 debt maturities.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had a $2.0 billion
    Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of banks
    syndicated in the United States and internationally, which
    expires in February 2011. This agreement allows for borrowings
    denominated in U.S. dollars or European euros with interest
    payable based upon various floating-rate options as selected by
    the Company. As a result of the rating agency downgrade, the
    costs related to the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will
    be higher. There were no amounts outstanding under the Five-Year
    Revolving Credit Agreement at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

In February 2006, the Company amended the terms of the
    $2.0 billion Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement; the
    amendment primarily affected the requirement for the Company to
    maintain certain

DEBT – (Concluded)

levels of net worth. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s net worth exceeded such requirement by
    $29 million. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as
    amended, also contains limitations on additional borrowings,
    related to the debt to total capitalization requirements; at
    December 31, 2008, the Company had additional borrowing
    capacity, subject to availability, of up to $284 million.
    Based on the credit agreement, the net worth covenant is
    adjusted on an annual basis. On a pro forma basis, as of
    January 1, 2009, the Company’s net worth, including
    the minority interest reclassification of $135 million
    (upon adoption of SFAS No. 160), would have exceeded
    the requirement by approximately $980 million. In addition,
    at January 1, 2009, the Company could borrow approximately
    $480 million or absorb a reduction to shareholders’
    equity of approximately $300 million and remain in
    compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant.

In order to borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit
    Agreement, there must not be any defaults in the Company’s
    covenants in the credit agreement (i.e., in addition to the two
    financial covenants, principally limitations on subsidiary debt,
    negative pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and
    maintenance of insurance) and the Company’s representations
    and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all
    material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no
    material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a
    material adverse change, in each case since December 31,
    2003, no material ERISA or environmental non-compliance and no
    material tax deficiency). The Company was in compliance with all
    debt covenants at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

At December 31, 2008, the maturities of long-term debt
    during each of the next five years were as follows:
    2009 – $71 million; 2010 –
    $302 million; 2011 – $2 million;
    2012 – $887 million; and 2013 –
    $201 million.

Interest paid was $232 million, $262 million and
    $238 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

M. MINORITY
    INTEREST

The Company owned 68 percent of Hansgrohe AG at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. The aggregate minority
    interest, net of dividends, of $135 million and
    $117 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, was recorded in deferred income taxes and other
    liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
    Upon adoption of SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009,
    the $135 million balance will be reclassified and increase
    shareholders’ equity.

As part of the agreement relating to the Company’s
    acquisition of an additional 37 percent equity ownership of
    Hansgrohe AG in December 2002 (increasing such ownership to
    64 percent), certain minority shareholders of Hansgrohe AG,
    representing four percent of Hansgrohe AG outstanding shares,
    held a put option which required the Company to purchase such
    shares in Hansgrohe AG with Company common stock. In May 2007,
    the put option was exercised and the Company issued two million
    shares of Company common stock with a value of $56 million
    for the additional four percent ownership in Hansgrohe AG.

N. STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company elected to change its method of accounting for
    stock-based compensation and implemented the fair value method
    prescribed by SFAS No. 123, effective January 1,
    2003. The Company used the prospective method, as defined by
    SFAS No. 148, for determining stock-based compensation
    expense. Accordingly, options granted, modified or settled
    subsequent to January 1, 2003 have been accounted for using
    the fair value method and options granted prior to
    January 1, 2003 were accounted for using the intrinsic
    value method.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION – (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, using the Modified Prospective
    Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method requires
    the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that
    were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through the remaining
    vesting periods, which ended December 31, 2007. The MPA
    method did not require the restatement of prior-year
    information. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the
    Company utilized the shortcut method to determine the tax
    windfall pool associated with stock options as of the date of
    adoption.

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) replaced the 1991 Long Term Stock
    Incentive Plan (the “1991 Plan”) in May 2005 and
    provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various
    forms. At December 31, 2008, outstanding stock-based
    incentives were in the form of long-term stock awards, stock
    options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights.
    Additionally, the Company’s 1997 Non-Employee Directors
    Stock Plan (the “1997 Plan”) provides for the payment
    of part of the compensation to non-employee Directors in Company
    common stock. The 1997 Plan expired in May 2007; subsequently,
    compensation to non-employee Directors in Company common stock
    is made from the 2005 Plan.

Pre-tax compensation expense (income) and the income tax benefit
    related to these stock-based incentives were as follows, in

    granting of stock options and other long-term stock incentive
    awards.

Long-Term Stock
    Awards

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and
    non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share
    dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of
    repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open
    market.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION – (Continued)

The Company measures compensation expense for stock awards at
    the market price of the Company’s common stock at the grant
    date. Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is being
    recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the
    stock awards, typically 10 years (except for stock awards
    held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five
    years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes
    retirement-eligible at age 65. For stock awards granted
    prior to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized
    over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically
    10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will
    become, retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the
    expense is being recognized over five years. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had remaining
    $6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to
    stock awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 to grantees
    that will or have become retirement-eligible before such awards
    will have been fully expensed; such expense will be recognized
    over the next four years, or immediately upon a grantee’s
    retirement.

At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, there was
    $155 million, $175 million and $195 million,
    respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense related to
    unvested stock awards; such awards had a weighted average
    remaining vesting period of seven years. At January 1,
    2006, the Company estimated a forfeiture rate for long-term
    stock awards and applied that rate to all previously expensed
    stock awards; such application did not result in a change in the
    expense to be recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting
    change.

The total market value (at the vesting date) of stock award
    shares which vested during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $30 million, $48 million and $51 million,
    respectively.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market
    price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date.
    These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over
    five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
    grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant
    date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration
    stock options, except for restoration options resulting from
    options previously granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration
    stock options become exercisable six months from the date of
    grant.

The Company granted 6,491,900 of stock option shares, including
    restoration stock option shares, during 2008 with a grant date
    exercise price range of $17 to $19 per share. During 2008,
    1,107,920 stock option shares were forfeited (including options
    that expired unexercised).

Aggregate intrinsic value is calculated using the Company’s
    stock price at each respective date, less the exercise price
    (grant date price) multiplied by the number of shares. At
    December 31, 2008, all exercise prices exceed the
    Company’s stock price, resulting in zero intrinsic value.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock options
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is
    being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of
    time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123.
    For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, such
    expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of
    the stock options, typically five years. At December 31,
    2008, the Company had $2 million of unrecognized
    compensation expense related to stock options granted prior to
    January 1, 2006 to grantees that will or have become
    retirement-eligible before such options will have been fully
    expensed; such expense will be recognized over the next two
    years, or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement.

    respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense (using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date) related to
    unvested stock options; such options had a weighted average
    remaining vesting period of three years. At January 1,
    2006, the Company estimated a forfeiture rate for stock options
    and applied that rate to all previously expensed stock options;
    such application did not result in a change in the expense to be

Phantom Stock
    Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights
    (“SARs”)

The Company grants phantom stock awards and SARs to certain

non-U.S. employees.

Phantom stock awards are linked to the value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant and are settled
    in cash upon vesting, typically over 10 years. The Company
    accounts for phantom stock awards as liability-based awards; the
    compensation expense is initially measured as the market price
    of the Company’s common stock at the grant date and is
    recognized over the vesting period. The liability is remeasured
    and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the
    awards are fully-vested and paid to the employees. The Company
    recognized (income) expense of $(2) million,
    $(2) million and $1 million related to the valuation
    of phantom stock awards for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company granted 234,800 shares,
    130,000 shares and 175,000 shares, respectively, of
    phantom stock awards with an aggregate fair value of
    $5 million, $4 million and $5 million,
    respectively, and paid $2 million, $4 million and
    $4 million of cash in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to
    settle phantom stock awards.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION – (Concluded)

SARs are linked to the value of the Company’s common stock
    on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon exercise. On
    January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for SARs, in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R, from the intrinsic value method to the
    fair value method. The fair value method requires outstanding
    SARs to be classified as liability-based awards and valued using
    a Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date; such
    fair value is recognized as compensation expense over the
    vesting period, typically five years. The liability is
    remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period
    until the SARs are exercised and payment is made to the
    employees or the SARs expire. The Company recognized (income)
    expense of $(3) million, $(5) million and $400,000
    related to the valuation of SARs for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company granted
    SARs for 597,200 shares, 521,100 shares and
    422,300 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value
    of $2 million, $4 million and $4 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

O.

EMPLOYEE
    RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors qualified defined-benefit and
    defined-contribution retirement plans for most of its employees.
    In addition to the Company’s qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans, the Company has unfunded non-qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans covering certain employees, which
    provide for benefits in addition to those provided by the
    qualified pension plans. Substantially all salaried employees
    participate in non-contributory defined-contribution retirement
    plans, to which payments are determined annually by the
    Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. Aggregate charges to earnings under the
    Company’s defined-benefit and defined-contribution
    retirement plans were $38 million and $30 million in
    2008, $44 million and $47 million in 2007 and
    $54 million and $44 million in 2006, respectively.

During 2006, the Company implemented SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),”
    (“SFAS No. 158”). Among other things,
    SFAS No. 158 requires companies to prospectively
    recognize a net liability or asset and to report the funded
    status of their defined-benefit pension and other
    post-retirement benefit plans on their balance sheets, with an
    offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income;
    such recognition did not affect the Company’s consolidated
    statements of income. In 2008, the Company adopted the
    measurement date requirements of SFAS No. 158 for
    certain foreign plans and there was no significant impact to the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for this change.

Plan
    Assets

The Company’s qualified defined-benefit pension plan
    weighted average asset allocation, which is based upon fair
    value, was as follows:

The investment objectives of the Company’s qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans are: 1) to earn a return, net
    of fees, greater than or equal to the expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets; 2) to diversify the portfolio among
    various asset classes with the goal of reducing volatility of
    return and reducing principal risk; and 3) to maintain
    liquidity sufficient to meet Plan obligations. Long-term target
    allocations are: equity securities (80%), debt securities (10%)
    and other investments (10%).

Plan assets included 1.4 million shares of Company common
    stock valued at $16 million and $31 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Assumptions

Major assumptions used in accounting for the Company’s
    defined-benefit pension plans were as follows:

December 31




Discount rate for obligations

4.00%

4.00%

Discount rate for net periodic pension cost

6.25%

5.50%

5.25%

The discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected
    duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities
    matched to the December 31, 2008 Citigroup Pension Discount
    Curve. Such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension
    plans ranged from 7.50 percent to 2.25 percent, with
    the most significant portion of the liabilities having a
    discount rate for obligations of 6.00 percent or higher at
    December 31, 2008.

The Company determined the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets by reviewing an analysis of expected and historical
    rates of return of various asset classes based upon the current
    and long-term target asset allocation of the plan assets. The
    measurement date used to determine the defined-benefit pension
    expense was December 31.

Other

The Company sponsors certain post-retirement benefit plans that
    provide medical, dental and life insurance coverage for eligible
    retirees and dependents in the United States based upon age and
    length of service. The aggregate present value of the unfunded
    accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
    $12 million and $9 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

In July 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase for retirement of up to 50 million shares of
    the Company’s common stock in open-market transactions or
    otherwise, replacing a previous Board of Directors authorization
    established in 2006. At December 31, 2008, the Company had
    remaining authorization to repurchase up to 32 million
    shares of its common stock in open-market transactions or
    otherwise. The Company repurchased and retired nine million
    common shares in 2008, 31 million common shares in 2007 and
    29 million common shares in 2006 for cash aggregating
    $160 million, $857 million and $854 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company continues to
    evaluate its share repurchase program in relation to its cash
    balances, cash flows and market conditions and has not
    repurchased any shares since July 2008 and does not anticipate
    further repurchases under current conditions. However,
    consistent with past practice, the Company anticipates
    repurchasing shares in 2009 to offset any dilution from
    long-term stock awards granted or stock options exercised as
    part of its compensation programs.

On the basis of amounts paid (declared), cash dividends per
    common share were $.925 ($.93) in 2008, $.91 ($.92) in 2007 and
    $.86 ($.88) in 2006, respectively. In 2008, the Company
    increased its quarterly cash dividend by two percent to $.235

    TAXES – (Continued)

The Company repatriated accumulated earnings from certain of its
    foreign subsidiaries from 2004 to 2007. These repatriations
    generated significant foreign tax credits that were used to
    offset the majority of the related U.S. tax and resulted in
    a $45 million foreign tax credit carryforward at
    December 31, 2007.

During 2008, the Company continued to repatriate foreign
    earnings including a substantial repatriation of low-taxed
    earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to fully utilize the
    foreign tax credit carryforward by December 31, 2008.
    Although the majority of the current U.S. tax on this
    substantial repatriation was offset by the foreign tax credit
    carryforward, the Company’s tax expense was increased by
    approximately $65 million. Also during 2008, the Company
    recorded pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other
    intangibles of $467 million ($445 million after-tax)
    that significantly increased the Company’s effective tax
    rate as the majority of the impairment charges did not provide a
    tax benefit. Excluding the effects of the substantial
    repatriation of low-taxed earnings and the impairment charges,
    the Company’s effective tax rate in 2008 was approximately
    35 percent.

A valuation allowance of $15 million and $9 million
    was recorded at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    on certain net operating loss carryforward balances that the
    Company believes will not be realized in future periods. Such
    net operating loss carryforward balances will not be realized
    primarily due to a recent history of losses of certain
    subsidiaries. The Company believes it is reasonably possible
    that the valuation allowance will increase by approximately
    $6 million within the next 12 months if certain
    subsidiaries continue to incur losses in 2009.

The $6 million deferred tax asset on the 2008 capital
    losses may be realized through a carryback to 2005 or carried
    forward to 2013. Of the deferred tax asset on the net operating
    loss carryforward, $9 million will expire between 2018 and
    2028 and $13 million is unlimited.

A $10 million and $19 million deferred tax liability
    has been provided at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign
    subsidiaries as such earnings are intended to be repatriated in
    the foreseeable future. A tax provision has not been provided at
    December 31, 2008 for U.S. income taxes or additional
    foreign withholding taxes on approximately $61 million of
    undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are
    considered to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable
    to determine the amount of deferred tax liability on such
    earnings as the actual U.S. tax would depend on income tax
    laws and circumstances at the time of distribution.

If recognized, $54 million and $50 million of the
    unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, net of any U.S. Federal tax benefit, would
    impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

At December 31, 2007, the total unrecognized tax benefits,
    including related interest and penalties, is recorded in
    deferred income taxes and other. At December 31, 2008,
    $105 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits,
    including related interest and penalties, is recorded in
    deferred income taxes and other, $7 million is recorded in
    accrued liabilities and $6 million is recorded in other
    assets.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal
    jurisdiction, and various local, state and foreign
    jurisdictions. Beginning with the 2006 consolidated
    U.S. Federal income tax return, the Company has been
    selected by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to
    participate in the Compliance Assurance Program
    (“CAP”). CAP is a real-time audit of the
    U.S. Federal income tax return that allows the IRS, working
    in conjunction with the Company, to determine tax return
    compliance with the U.S. Federal tax law prior to filing
    the return. This program provides the Company with greater
    certainty about its tax

liability for a given year within months, rather than years, of
    filing its annual tax return and greatly reduces the need for
    recording U.S. Federal unrecognized tax benefits. The IRS
    has completed their examination of the Company’s
    consolidated U.S. Federal tax returns through 2007. With
    few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state or
    foreign income tax examinations on filed returns for years
    before 2000.

As a result of tax audit closings, settlements and the
    expiration of applicable statutes of limitations in various
    jurisdictions within the next 12 months, the Company
    anticipates that it is reasonably possible the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately
    $8 million.

OTHER COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES – (Continued)

Early in 2003, a suit was brought against the Company and a
    number of its insulation installation companies in the federal
    court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleging that certain practices
    violate provisions of federal and state antitrust laws. The
    plaintiff publicized the lawsuit with a press release and stated
    in that release that the U.S. Department of Justice was
    investigating the business practices of the Company’s
    insulation installation companies. Although the Company was
    unaware of any investigation at that time, the Company was later
    advised that an investigation had been commenced but was
    subsequently closed without any enforcement action recommended.
    Two additional lawsuits were subsequently brought in Virginia
    making similar claims under the antitrust laws. Both of these
    lawsuits have since been dismissed without any payment or
    requirement for any change in business practices. During the
    second half of 2004, the same counsel who commenced the initial
    action in Atlanta filed six additional lawsuits on behalf of
    several of Masco’s competitors in the insulation
    installation business. The plaintiffs then dismissed all of
    these lawsuits and, represented by the same counsel, filed
    another action in the same federal court as a putative class
    action against the Company, a number of its insulation
    installation companies and certain of their suppliers. All of
    the Company’s suppliers, who were co-defendants in this
    lawsuit, have settled this case. On February 9, 2009, the
    federal court in Atlanta issued an Opinion, which the Company is
    evaluating, in which the Court certified a class of 377
    insulation contractors. In its Opinion, the Court also ruled on
    various other motions. Two additional lawsuits, seeking class
    action status and alleging anticompetitive conduct, were filed
    against the Company and a number of its insulation suppliers.
    One of these lawsuits was filed in a Florida state court and has
    been dismissed by the court with prejudice. The other lawsuit
    was filed in federal court in northern California and was
    subsequently transferred to federal court in Atlanta, Georgia.
    The Company is vigorously defending the pending cases. Based
    upon the advice of its outside counsel, the Company believes
    that the conduct of the Company and its insulation installation
    companies, which has been the subject of the above-described
    lawsuits, has not violated any antitrust laws. The Company is
    unable at this time to reliably estimate any potential liability
    which might occur from an adverse judgment. There cannot be any
    assurance that the Company will ultimately prevail in the
    remaining lawsuits, or, if unsuccessful, that the ultimate
    liability would not be material and would not have a material
    adverse effect on its businesses or the methods used by its
    insulation installation companies in doing business.

In 2004, the Company learned that European governmental
    authorities were investigating possible anticompetitive business
    practices relating to the plumbing and heating industries in
    Europe. The investigations involve a number of European
    companies, including certain of the Company’s European
    manufacturing divisions and a number of other large businesses.
    As part of its broadened governance activities, the Company,
    with the assistance of its outside counsel, completed a review
    of the competition practices of its European divisions,
    including those in the plumbing and heating industries, and the
    Company is cooperating fully with the European governmental
    authorities. Several private antitrust lawsuits have been filed
    in the United States as putative class actions against, among
    others, the Company and certain of the other companies being
    investigated relating to the defendants’ plumbing
    operations. These appear to be an outgrowth of the
    investigations being conducted by European governmental
    authorities. These lawsuits have been dismissed, however, the
    Company has been notified that a notice of appeal has been filed
    in one of these lawsuits. Based upon the advice of its outside
    counsel, the review of the competition practices of its European
    divisions referred to above and other factors, the Company
    believes that it will not incur material liability as a result
    of the matters that are the subject of these investigations.

Several California-based installation subsidiaries of the
    Company were named as defendants in an alleged
    employment-related class action lawsuit arising under state law.
    The subsidiaries recently reached an agreement with the
    plaintiffs to settle this litigation for approximately
    $9 million. In

Warranty

Certain of the Company’s products and product finishes and
    services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in
    material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to
    the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any
    changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
    servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted
    accordingly.

Acquisition-Related
    Commitments

The Company, as part of certain acquisition agreements, provided
    for the payment of additional consideration in cash, contingent
    upon whether certain conditions are met, including the operating
    performance of the acquired business. At December 31, 2008,
    the Company had no additional consideration payable in cash
    contingent upon the operating performance of the acquired
    businesses.

Investments

With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity
    funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2008, commitments
    to contribute up to $42 million of additional capital to
    such funds representing the Company’s aggregate capital
    commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to
    date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional
    capital contributions to certain of its private equity funds
    upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. The
    Company has no control over when or if the capital calls will
    occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in
    an increase in the carrying value of the Company’s
    investment in the private equity fund when paid.

Residual Value
    Guarantees

The Company has residual value guarantees resulting from
    operating leases, primarily related to certain of the
    Company’s trucks and other vehicles, in the Installation
    and Other Services segment. The operating leases are generally
    for a minimum term of 24 months and are renewable monthly
    after the initial term. After the end of the initial term, if
    the Company cancels the leases, the Company must pay the lessor
    the difference between the guaranteed residual value and the
    fair market value of the related vehicles. The value of
    lease-related guarantees, including the obligation payable under
    the residual value guarantees, assuming the fair value at lease
    termination is zero, was approximately $64 million at
    December 31, 2008.

For all operating leases that contain residual value guarantee
    provisions (principally related to vehicles), the Company
    calculates the amount due under the guarantees and compares such
    amount to the fair value of the leased assets. If the amount
    payable under the residual value guarantee exceeds the



MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

U.

OTHER COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES – (Concluded)

fair value at lease termination, the Company would record a
    liability equal to such excess with a corresponding charge to
    earnings. At December 31, 2008, the estimated fair market
    value exceeded the amount payable under the residual value
    guarantees and no liability was recorded.

Other
    Matters

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and
    customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries
    in which it operates. Such indemnifications include customer
    claims against builders for issues relating to the
    Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with
    divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally
    provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to
    various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal
    and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and
    asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material
    amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the
    probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately
    records an estimated liability when probable.

    Registered Public Accounting Firm.”

(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

In connection with the evaluation of the Company’s
    “internal control over financial reporting” that
    occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, which
    is required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by
    paragraph (d) of Exchange

Rules 13a-15

or

15d-15,

(as defined in paragraph (f) of

Rule 13a-15),

management determined that, except as noted below, there was no
    change that materially affected or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect internal control over financial reporting.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company continued a
    phased deployment of a new Enterprise Resource Planning
    (“ERP”) system at Masco Builder Cabinet Group, one of
    the Company’s larger business units. The new ERP system is
    a process improvement initiative and is not in response to any
    identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting. However, the business process
    initiative is significant in scale and complexity and will
    result in modifications to certain internal controls. The new
    ERP system is designed to enhance the overall system of internal
    control over financial reporting through further automation and
    integration of business processes.
