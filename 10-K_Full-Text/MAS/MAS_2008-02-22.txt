2007 Annual Report on

Form 10-K




PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Masco Corporation manufactures, distributes and installs home
    improvement and building products, with emphasis on brand name
    consumer products and services holding leadership positions in
    their markets. The Company is among the largest manufacturers in
    North America of a number of home improvement and building
    products, including faucets, cabinets, architectural coatings
    and windows and is one of the largest installers of building
    products for the new home construction market. The Company
    generally provides broad product offerings in a variety of
    styles and price points and distributes products through
    multiple channels including home builders and wholesale and
    retail channels. Approximately 80 percent of the
    Company’s 2007 sales were generated by North American
    operations. The balance of sales were made by our other
    operations, located principally in Belgium, China, Denmark,
    Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

The Company’s businesses operate in five segments arranged
    by similarity in products and services. The following table sets
    forth, for the three years ended December 31, 2007, the
    contribution of the Company’s segments to net sales and
    operating profit. Additional financial information concerning
    the Company’s operations by segment and by geographic
    regions, as well as general corporate expense, as of and for the
    three years ended December 31, 2007, is set forth in
    Note P to the Company’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Except as the context otherwise indicates, the terms
    “Masco” and the “Company” refer to Masco
    Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Cabinets and
    Related Products

In North America, the Company manufactures and sells economy,
    stock, semi-custom, assembled and

ready-to-assemble

cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home
    entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price
    points. In Europe, the Company manufactures and sells assembled
    and

ready-to-assemble

kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home entertainment
    cabinetry. These products are sold under a number of trademarks
    including
    KRAFTMAID

®

,
    MILL’S
    PRIDE

®

,
    TVILUM-
    SCANBIRK

tm

and
    WOODGATE

tm

primarily to dealers and home centers, and under the names
    MERILLAT

®

,
    MOORES

tm

and QUALITY
    CABINETS

®

primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the home
    improvement and new home construction markets. Cabinet sales are
    significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home
    construction and retail consumer spending, particularly spending
    for major home improvement products. A significant portion of
    our sales for the home improvement market are made through home
    center retailers.

The cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States and
    Europe is highly competitive, with several large competitors and
    numerous local and regional competitors. In addition to price,
    the Company believes that competition in this industry is based
    largely on product quality, responsiveness to customer needs and
    product features. Significant North American competitors include
    American Woodmark Corporation, Fortune Brands, Inc. and Cardell
    Cabinetry.

In 2007, the Company completed additions to its North American
    cabinet manufacturing capacity, which were undertaken in order
    to meet increased demand for cabinet products. The anticipated
    benefits of the new capacity have not been realized due to the
    decline in new home construction and consumer spending activity
    since 2006.

Plumbing
    Products

In North America, the Company sells a wide variety of faucet and
    showering devices that are manufactured by or for the Company.
    Products are sold under various brand names including
    DELTA

®

,
    PEERLESS

®

,
    HANSGROHE

®

,
    BRASSTECH

®

,
    BRIZO

®

,
    NEWPORT
    BRASS

®

,
    AXOR

®

,
    ALSONS

®

and PLUMB
    SHOP

®

.
    Products include single- and double-handle faucets, showerheads,
    handheld showers and valves, which are sold by
    manufacturers’ representatives and Company sales personnel
    to major retail accounts and to distributors who sell these
    products to plumbers, building contractors, remodelers, smaller
    retailers and others. The Company sells kitchen and bath
    faucets, showering devices and various other plumbing products
    for European markets under the brand names HANSGROHE,
    BRISTAN

tm

,
    AXOR and
    DAMIXA

®

,
    which are sold through multiple distribution channels.

Masco believes that its faucet operations are among the leaders
    in sales in the North American market, with American Standard,
    Kohler, Moen and Price Pfister as major brand competitors. The
    Company also has several major competitors among the European
    manufacturers, primarily in Germany and Italy, including
    Friedrich Grohe. The Company faces significant competition from
    private label products (including house brands sold by certain
    of the Company’s customers). Many of the faucet and
    showering products with which the Company’s products
    compete are manufactured in Asia. As part of the Company’s
    strategy for the Plumbing Products segment, these businesses
    have been reducing the volume of products manufactured
    domestically and increasing their Asian manufacturing and
    sourcing of products.

Other plumbing products manufactured and sold by the Company
    include AQUA
    GLASS

®

,
    MIROLIN

®

and AMERICAN SHOWER &
    BATH

tm

acrylic and gelcoat bath and shower enclosure units, shower
    trays and laundry tubs, which are sold primarily to wholesale
    plumbing distributors and home center retailers for the North
    American home improvement and new home construction markets. The
    Company’s spas are manufactured and sold under HOT
    SPRING

®

,
    CALDERA

®

and other trademarks directly to independent dealers. Major
    competitors include Kohler, Lasco, Maax and Jacuzzi.
    HÜPPE

®

and
    BREUER

tm

shower enclosures are sold by the Company through wholesale
    channels and home



centers primarily in Germany and western Europe.
    HERITAGE

tm

ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally
    sold in the United Kingdom directly to selected retailers.
    GLASS

tm

and
    PHARO

tm

acrylic bathtubs and steam shower enclosures are also sold in
    Europe.

Also included in the Plumbing Products segment are brass and
    copper plumbing system components and other plumbing
    specialties, which are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware
    wholesalers and to home center retailers, hardware stores,
    building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These
    products are marketed in North America for the wholesale trade
    under the
    BRASSCRAFT

®

and BRASSTECH trademarks and for the “do-it-yourself”
    market under the MASTER
    PLUMBER

®

and PLUMB SHOP trademarks and are also sold under private label.

In addition to price, the Company believes that competition in
    its Plumbing Products markets is based largely on brand
    reputation, product quality, product features, and breadth of
    product offering.

A substantial portion of the Company’s plumbing products
    are made from brass, the major components of which are copper
    and zinc. From time to time, the Company has encountered
    volatility in the price of brass. In addition, legislation
    enacted in California to become effective in January 2010
    mandates new standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing
    products sold in California. Similar legislation is being
    considered by other states. Faucet manufacturers, including the
    Company, will be required to obtain adequate supplies of
    lead-free brass or suitable alternative materials for continued
    production of faucets. An increase in the demand for lead-free
    brass may cause a shortage of supply and resulting price
    increases and could adversely impact this segment’s
    operating results.

Installation and
    Other Services

The Company’s Installation and Other Services segment sells
    installed building products and distributes building products
    primarily to the new home construction industry, and to a lesser
    extent, the commercial construction market, throughout the
    United States. Historically, the Company concentrated on the
    installation and distribution of insulation, which comprised
    approximately 12 percent, 15 percent and
    15 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Net sales of non-insulation products (both
    installed and distributed) in 2007 represented approximately
    46 percent of the segment’s net sales. Our offering of
    installed building products includes insulation, cabinetry,
    gutters, fireplaces, garage doors and framing components.
    Distributed products include insulation, insulation accessories,
    gutters, roofing, cabinetry and fireplaces. Collaboration with
    other Company businesses has resulted in sales of installed
    Company products, such as cabinetry, windows, paint and bath
    accessories. Installed building products are sold primarily to
    custom and production homebuilders by the Company’s network
    of branch locations throughout most of the United States.
    Distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and
    dealers from distribution centers in various parts of the United
    States. As discussed under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” sales and operating results for the
    Installation and Other Services segment are significantly
    affected by the level of new home construction activity.

In addition to price, the Company believes that competition in
    this industry is based largely on customer service, range of
    products and services offered, and quality of installation
    service. The Company believes it is the largest national
    provider of installed insulation in the United States.
    Competitors include several regional contractors, as well as
    numerous local contractors and lumber yards.

The Company buys insulation from a limited number of large
    suppliers in the United States market. Historically, during
    periods of rapid growth in the new home construction market, the
    industry has encountered shortages of insulation, leading to
    price volatility and allocations of supply. As one of the
    country’s largest purchasers of insulation, the Company has
    been able to successfully meet its needs in the past, although
    the volatility of material costs does impact our financial
    performance.



The Installation and Other Services segment is a labor-intensive
    business. Significant changes in federal, state and local
    regulations addressing immigration and wages, as well as
    collective bargaining arrangements affecting wages and working
    conditions, could adversely affect the financial performance of
    the Company’s business.

Decorative
    Architectural Products

The Company manufactures architectural coatings including
    paints, specialty paint products, stains, varnishes and
    waterproofing products. The products are sold in the United
    States and Canada under the brand names
    BEHR

®

,
    KILZ

®

and
    EXPRESSIONS

®

to the “do-it-yourself” and professional markets
    through home centers, paint stores and other retailers. BEHR
    products were also recently introduced in China. The KILZ brand
    is sold in North America through home center retailers and
    discount retailers, and through hardware stores, paint stores
    and dealers. Net sales of architectural coatings comprised
    approximately 13 percent, 11 percent and
    11 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Competitors in the architectural coatings market
    include large national and international brands such as Benjamin
    Moore, Glidden, Olympic, Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Zinsser,
    as well as many regional and other national brands. In addition
    to price, the Company believes that competition in this industry
    is based largely on product quality, technology and product
    innovation, customer service and brand reputation.

The BEHR brand is sold through The Home Depot, the
    segment’s and the Company’s largest customer. The
    paint departments at The Home Depot stores include the Behr
    color center and computer kiosk with the COLOR SMART BY
    BEHR

®

computerized color-matching system that enables consumers to
    select and coordinate their paint-color selection. The loss of
    The Home Depot as a customer would significantly impact the
    segment’s business and that of the Company as a whole.

Titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of
    paint. Shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium
    dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand
    and from disruption of refining capacity (i.e., Hurricane
    Katrina in the fall of 2005). Similar events in the future could
    adversely impact the financial performance of the Company’s
    business. Petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of
    architectural coatings. Significant increases in the cost of
    crude oil lead to higher raw material costs (i.e., for resins,
    solvents, packaging), which can adversely affect the
    segment’s results of operations.

The Decorative Architectural Products segment also includes
    LIBERTY

®

door, window and other hardware, which is manufactured for the
    Company and sold to home centers, other retailers, original
    equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets. Key competitors
    in North America include Amerock, Belwith, Umbra and Stanley.
    Decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under
    the brand names FRANKLIN
    BRASS

®

and DECOR
    BATHWARE

®

to distributors, home center retailers and other retailers.
    Competitors include Moen and Globe Union.

Other Specialty
    Products

The Company manufactures and sells vinyl, fiberglass and
    aluminum windows and doors under the MILGARD
    WINDOWS

®

brand name to the new home construction and home improvement
    markets, principally in the western United States. MILGARD
    WINDOWS products are sold primarily through dealers and, to a
    lesser extent, direct to production homebuilders and through
    lumberyards and home center retailers. The segment’s
    competitors in North America include national brands, such as
    Jeld-Wen, Simonton, Pella and Andersen, and numerous regional
    brands. In the United Kingdom, the Company manufactures and
    sells windows, related products and components under several
    brand names including
    GRIFFIN

tm

,
    CAMBRIAN

tm

,
    PREMIER

tm

and
    DURAFLEX

tm

.
    Sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the
    repair and remodeling markets. United Kingdom competitors
    include many small and mid-sized firms and a few large,
    vertically integrated competitors. In addition to price, the
    Company believes that competition in this industry is based
    largely on customer service and product quality.



The Company manufactures and sells a complete line of manual and
    electric staple gun tackers, staples and other fastening tools
    under the brand names
    ARROW

®

and
    POWERSHOT

®

.
    These products are sold through various distribution channels
    including home center and other retailers and wholesalers. The
    principal North American competitor in this product line is
    Stanley.

The Company also manufactures residential hydronic radiators and
    heat convectors under the brand names
    BRUGMAN

®

,
    SUPERIA

tm

,
    THERMIC

tm

and
    VASCO

®

,
    which are sold to the European wholesale market and to retail
    home centers from operations in Belgium, The Netherlands and
    Poland.

Additional
    Information

•

The Company holds United States and foreign patents, patent
    applications, licenses, trademarks and trade names. As a
    manufacturer and distributor of brand name products, we view our
    trademarks and other proprietary rights as important, but do not
    believe that there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of
    such rights that would have a material adverse effect on our
    present business as a whole.

•

All of the Company’s operating segments, except the
    Plumbing Products segment, normally experience stronger sales
    during the second and third calendar quarters, corresponding
    with the peak season for new home construction and remodeling.

•

Compliance with federal, state and local regulations relating to
    the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
    relating to the protection of the environment, is not expected
    to result in material capital expenditures by the Company or to
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s earning or
    competitive position.

•

The Company does not consider backlog orders to be material.

•

At December 31, 2007, the Company employed approximately
    52,000 people. Satisfactory relations have generally
    prevailed between the Company and its employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may
    affect our Company. These risks and uncertainties could cause
    future results to differ from past performance or expected
    results, including results described in statements elsewhere in
    this Report that constitute “forward-looking
    statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
    Act of 1995. The impact on our Company of certain of these risk
    factors is discussed below under Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.” Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently
    believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact our Company.
    Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events,
    these developments could have material adverse effects on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. These
    risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the
    following, which we consider to be most relevant to our specific
    business activities.



A significant
    portion of our business relies on residential construction
    activity and general economic conditions.

A significant part of our business is affected by levels of home
    improvement (including repair and remodeling) and new home
    construction activity, principally in North America and Europe.
    Demographic factors, such as changes in population growth and
    household formations, affect levels of home improvement and new
    home construction over the long term. Significant factors that
    impact demand for home improvement and new home construction in
    the short term include the inventory levels of unsold new and
    existing homes, general and regional economic conditions,
    consumer confidence and credit, terms and availability of
    financing, affordability of homes, interest rates, energy costs,
    and, on a more localized basis, weather conditions and natural
    disasters. The new home construction market, in particular, is
    cyclical in nature. A discussion of the impact of the decline in
    new home construction and in consumer spending for home
    improvement items on our various segments and on the
    Company’s operating results is located under
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” under Item 7 of
    this Report.

We rely on key
    customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our
    distribution channels.

The size and importance of individual customers to our
    businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution
    channels have consolidated. Larger customers can effect
    significant changes in their volume of purchases and can
    otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which
    we do business. Further, during downturns in our markets,
    declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of
    significant customers may impact the volume of our business, the
    credit risk involved and our terms of doing business with them.
    Sales of our home improvement and building products to home
    center retailers are substantial. In 2007, sales to the
    Company’s largest customer, The Home Depot, were
    $2.4 billion (approximately 20 percent of the
    Company’s consolidated net sales). Although builders,
    dealers and other retailers represent other channels of
    distribution for the Company’s products and services, the
    loss of a substantial portion of our sales to The Home Depot
    would have a material adverse impact on the Company.

As some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted
    customers, conflicts occur and in some instances we may also
    become their competitor. Increasingly, we are transacting
    business directly with our larger customers. These arrangements
    may undermine the business relationships we have with customers
    who purchase our products through traditional wholesale means.
    In addition, our large retail customers are increasingly
    requesting product exclusivity, which may impact our product
    offerings to other customers.

Our principal
    markets are becoming more competitive.

The major geographic markets for our products and services are
    highly competitive and, in recent years, competition has
    intensified significantly. Competition is further exacerbated
    during economic downturns. Home center retailers are increasing
    their purchases of products directly from manufacturers,
    particularly low-cost suppliers in Asia, for sale as private
    label and house brand merchandise. Also, home center retailers,
    which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on
    retail consumers and remodelers, are increasingly turning their
    marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and
    installers. The Company believes that competition in our
    industries is based largely on price, product and service
    quality, brand reputation, customer service and product
    features. Although the relative importance of such factors
    varies among customers and product categories, price is often a
    primary factor.

Although we view the long term demographic trends for our
    markets as generally favorable, our markets are mature, cyclical
    and growing slowly. Additionally, our market position in and the
    competitive composition of our traditional markets affect our
    ability to expand our market share. In recent years, we have
    directed our strategic focus to organic growth and on developing
    new products and



expanding our services, rather than on growth through
    acquisitions. However, our ability to maintain our competitive
    positions in our markets and to grow our businesses is
    challenged since it depends to a large extent upon successfully
    maintaining our relationships with major customers, implementing
    growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new
    geographic markets, capitalizing on and strengthening our brand
    names, managing our cost structure, accommodating shorter
    life-cycles for our products and identifying and effectively
    responding to changing consumer preferences and spending
    patterns through product development and innovation.

The importance of sophisticated information technology to our
    industry is increasing. In order to remain competitive and
    respond to customer requirements and changes in their business
    processes, such as inventory replenishment, merchandise
    ordering, transportation and payment processing, the Company
    must be able to identify and implement comprehensive enterprise
    resource planning (“ERP”) systems. ERP systems are
    also critical to our supply chain management and logistics
    capabilities. The successful implementation of ERP systems also
    requires significant investment by the Company of both time and
    capital. Difficulties encountered in the deployment of
    significant new systems and other technology could be disruptive
    to the operation of our businesses.

The cost and
    availability of materials and labor and the performance of our
    supply chain affect our operating results.

When we incur cost increases for commodities or materials that
    are major components of our products or services, such as brass,
    insulation or titanium dioxide, it can be difficult for us to
    offset the impact on our operating results on a timely basis.
    Delays in adjusting or inability to adjust prices may be due to
    such factors as our existing arrangements with customers,
    competitive considerations, or customer resistance to such price
    increases. When the number of available sources for raw
    materials is limited, price volatility is more likely to occur
    and with longer duration when demand exceeds supply. In addition
    to their impact on our production expenses, increased costs of
    energy and other commodities, such as crude oil, can
    significantly affect the cost to transport our products and
    adversely affect our results of operations. See
    “Installation and Other Services” for a discussion of
    the impact of cost of raw materials and availability of labor
    and materials on that segment of our business.

We may also be adversely affected if our homebuilder customers
    encounter difficulty or delays in obtaining required materials
    from their other suppliers or if they encounter labor shortages.
    This is particularly likely to occur during periods of rapid
    growth in the new home construction market. Under such
    circumstances, homebuilders may delay their construction
    schedules and, as a result, may reduce or delay their purchase
    of products and services from us.

We rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain
    of our products or key components. If there is an interruption
    in these sources of supply, we may experience difficulty or
    delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be
    disrupted.

International
    political, economic and social developments impact our
    business.

Over 20 percent of our sales are derived outside of North
    America (principally in Europe) and are transacted in currencies
    other than U.S. dollars (principally European euros and
    Great Britain pounds). Our international business faces risks
    associated with changes in political, monetary, economic and
    social environments, local labor conditions and practices, the
    laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, cultural
    differences and differences in enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights. The financial reporting of our
    consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in
    currency exchange rates, which may present challenges in
    comparing operating performance from period to period and in
    forecasting future performance. U.S. laws affecting
    activities of U.S. companies doing business abroad,
    including tax laws and laws regulating various business
    practices, also impact our international business. Our
    international operating results may be influenced, when compared
    to our North American results, in part due to relative economic
    conditions in the European markets and due to competitive
    pricing pressures on certain products.



Increasingly, we are manufacturing in Asia and sourcing products
    and components from third parties in Asia. The distances
    involved in these arrangements, together with differences in
    business practices, shipping and delivery requirements, the
    limited number of suppliers, and laws and regulations, have
    increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain, the
    complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for
    interruptions in our production scheduling.

We have financial
    commitments and investments in financial assets, including
    assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial
    risk.

We have maintained investments in

available-for-sale

securities (including marketable and auction rate securities)
    and a number of private equity funds. Since there is no active
    trading market for investments in private equity funds, they are
    for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature,
    can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk,
    including financial leverage, than other financial investments.
    Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of
    the underlying investments or new information provided by
    private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of
    such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation. In
    addition, we have commitments that require us to contribute
    additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of
    a capital call from the private equity fund.

Product liability
    claims and other litigation could be costly.

Increasingly, homebuilders, including our customers, are subject
    to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary
    course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with
    these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify
    them against liability for the performance of our products or
    services or the performance of other products that we install.
    These claims frequently result in lawsuits against the
    homebuilders and many of their subcontractors, including the
    Company, and require defense costs even when such products or
    services are not the principal basis for the claims.

We are also subject to product safety regulations, recalls and
    direct claims for product liability, including putative class
    actions. Product liability claims can result in significant
    liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly
    to defend. Also, we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to
    provide us with products or components for products that we
    sell. Because of the difficulty of controlling the quality of
    products or components sourced from other manufacturers, we are
    exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to
    limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.

The Company has experienced an increase in the number of
    putative class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon
    claims for antitrust violations, product liability, wage and
    hour issues and other matters. The Company has generally denied
    liability and vigorously defends these cases. However, even when
    there is no basis for imposing liability on the Company, such
    lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve due to their scope,
    complexity and the potentially significant exposure that is
    alleged.

See Note T to the consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 of this Report for additional
    information about litigation involving our businesses.

Government and
    industry responses to environmental and health and safety
    concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating
    results.

Government and other regulations pertaining to health and safety
    (including protection of employees as well as consumers) and
    environmental concerns continue to emerge, domestically as well
    as internationally. In addition to having to comply with current
    requirements (including requirements that do not become
    effective until a future date), even more stringent requirements
    could be imposed on our industries in the future. Compliance
    with these regulations (such as the restrictions on lead content
    in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and
    formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our
    businesses), may require us to alter our manufacturing and
    installation processes and our sourcing. Such actions could
    adversely impact our operating results, and our ability to
    effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely
    impact our competitive position.



The long-term
    performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract,
    develop and retain talented management.

To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain highly
    qualified and talented personnel in management, sales,
    marketing, research and development and, as we enter new
    international markets, skilled personnel familiar with these
    markets. We compete with multinational firms in manufacturing
    and other industries for these employees and we invest
    significant resources in recruiting, developing and motivating
    them. The failure to attract, motivate, develop and retain key
    managers and other key employees could negatively affect our
    competitive position and our operating results.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The financial and business analysis below provides information
    which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and
    understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis
    should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
    statements and related notes.

The following discussion and certain other sections of this
    Report contain statements reflecting the Company’s views
    about its future performance and constitute
    “forward-looking statements” under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve
    risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and,
    accordingly, the Company’s actual results may differ
    materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking
    statements. Readers should consider that various factors,
    including those discussed in Item 1A “Risk
    Factors” of this Report, the “Executive
    Level Overview,” “Critical Accounting Policies
    and Estimates” and “Outlook for the Company”
    sections, may affect the Company’s performance. The Company
    undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
    statements as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise.

Executive
    Level Overview

The Company manufactures, distributes and installs home
    improvement and building products. These products are sold to
    the home improvement and new home construction markets through
    mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, builders,
    distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors.

Factors that affect the Company’s results of operations
    include the levels of new home construction and home improvement
    activity principally in North America and Europe, the importance
    of and the Company’s relationships with key customers
    (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately
    20 percent of the Company’s net sales in 2007), the
    Company’s ability to maintain its leadership positions in
    its U.S. and global markets in the face of increasing
    competition, the Company’s ability to effectively manage
    its overall cost structure, and the cost and availability of
    labor and materials. The Company’s international business
    faces political, monetary, economic and other risks that vary
    from country to country, as well as fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Further, the Company has financial commitments
    and investments in financial assets that are not readily
    marketable and that involve financial risk. In addition, product
    liability claims and other litigation could be costly. These and
    other factors are discussed in more detail in Item 1A
    “Risk Factors” of this Report.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial
    condition and results of operations are based upon the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have
    been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
    these financial statements requires the Company to make certain
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. The Company regularly reviews its estimates and
    assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well
    as current economic conditions and various other factors that
    are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
    results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
    carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not
    readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
    from these estimates and assumptions.

The Company believes that the following critical accounting
    policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates
    used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.



Revenue
    Recognition and Receivables

The Company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of
    loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered.
    The Company records revenue for unbilled services performed
    based upon estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and
    Other Services segment; such amounts are recorded in
    Receivables. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue
    for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special
    pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions
    and other volume-based incentives. Allowances for doubtful
    accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses
    resulting from the inability of customers to make required
    payments.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value, with expense estimates made for obsolescence or
    unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the
    recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value
    based upon assumptions about future demand and market
    conditions. On an on-going basis, the Company monitors these
    estimates and records adjustments for differences between
    estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results
    have not significantly deviated from those determined using
    these estimates.

Financial
    Investments

The Company has maintained investments in available-for-sale and
    marketable securities and a number of private equity funds,
    which aggregated $114 million and $173 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2007. Investments in
    available-for-sale and marketable securities are recorded at
    fair value, and unrealized gains or losses (that are deemed to
    be temporary) are recognized, net of tax, through
    shareholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The
    Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an
    investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to
    be other-than-temporary. During 2007, the Company recognized
    non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of $6 million related
    to its investment in Furniture Brands International common stock
    and $3 million related to its investment in Asahi Tec
    common stock.

From time to time, the Company invests its excess cash in
    short-term financial instruments including auction rate
    securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities
    that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or
    35 days. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company
    revised the classification of investments in auction rate
    securities from cash and cash investments to available-for-sale
    securities included in other assets on the consolidated balance
    sheet. The Company has also made corresponding adjustments to
    the consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, to reflect the gross cash
    purchases and sales of these securities in cash flows (for) from
    investing activities. These changes in classification do not
    affect previously reported consolidated statements of income or
    cash flows from operating activities in any prior period. During
    2007, the Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charge of $3 million related to auction rate securities.

On January 11, 2007, the acquisition of Metaldyne
    Corporation (“Metaldyne”) (formerly MascoTech, Inc.)
    by Asahi Tec Corporation (“Asahi Tec”), a Japanese
    automotive supplier, was finalized. The combined fair value of
    the Asahi Tec common and preferred stock, as well as the
    derivative related to the conversion feature on the preferred
    stock, received in exchange for the Company’s investment in
    Metaldyne, was $72 million. As a result of the transaction,
    the Company recognized a gain of $14 million, net of
    transaction fees, included in the Company’s consolidated
    statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    in income from other investments, net. Subsequent to the
    transaction, the Company’s investment in Asahi Tec common
    and preferred stock is accounted for as available-for-sale and
    unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value
    of the Asahi Tec common and preferred stock at December 31,
    2007 have been recognized, net of tax, through
    shareholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For the
    year ended December 31, 2007, the unrealized loss of
    $17 million related to the change in fair value of the
    derivative



related to the conversion feature on the preferred stock, has
    been included in income from other investments, net.

In addition, immediately prior to its sale, Metaldyne
    distributed shares of TriMas Corporation (“TriMas”)
    common stock as a dividend to the holders of Metaldyne common
    stock; the Company recognized income of $4 million included
    in the Company’s consolidated statement of income, in
    dividend income from other investments. In May 2007, TriMas made
    an initial public offering; subsequent to the offering, the
    Company’s investment in TriMas is accounted for as
    available-for-sale and unrealized gains or losses related to the
    change in fair value of the investment have been recognized, net
    of tax, through shareholders’ equity, as a component of
    other comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet.

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for
    potential impairment when impairment indicators are present, or
    when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may
    have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    investment. Impairment indicators the Company considers include
    the following: whether there has been a significant
    deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business
    prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory,
    economic or technological environment; a significant adverse
    change in the general market condition or geographic area in
    which the investment operates; and any bona fide offers to
    purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. Since
    there is no active trading market for these investments, they
    are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their
    nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business
    risk, including financial leverage, than other financial
    investments. Future changes in market conditions, the future
    performance of the underlying investments or new information
    provided by private equity fund managers could affect the
    recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized
    upon liquidation. During 2007, the Company recognized non-cash,
    pre-tax impairment charges of $10 million related to
    certain of its investments in private equity funds.

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair
    value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill
    or other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
    in the fourth quarter of each year, or as an event occurs or
    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying
    amount, the Company completes the impairment testing of goodwill
    utilizing a discounted cash flow method.

Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method
    requires the Company to make significant estimates and
    assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows,
    market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The
    Company’s judgments are based upon historical experience,
    current market trends, consultations with external valuation
    specialists and other information. While the Company believes
    that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation
    methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions
    could result in a different outcome. In estimating future cash
    flows, the Company relies on internally generated five-year
    forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital
    expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term
    assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the
    five-year forecast. The Company generally develops these
    forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for
    existing products, planned timing of new product launches,
    estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for
    existing homes.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company estimated that future
    discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting
    business units were greater than the carrying values. Any
    increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no
    impact on the reported value of goodwill.

If the carrying amount of a reporting business unit exceeds its
    fair value, the Company measures the possible goodwill
    impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair
    value of the reporting business unit to all of the underlying
    assets and liabilities of the reporting business unit, including
    any



previously unrecognized intangible assets. The excess of the
    fair value of a reporting business unit over the amounts
    assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value
    of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that
    a reporting business unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the
    implied fair value of goodwill.

In 2007, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges for goodwill of $177 million ($177 million,
    after tax). The pre-tax impairment charges recorded in 2007 were
    as follows: Plumbing Products segment —
    $69 million related to a North American manufacturer of
    plumbing-related products; and Other Specialty Products
    segment — $108 million related to a European
    manufacturer of heating products.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances
    change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard
    to the reporting unit. The Company considers the implications of
    both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local
    economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and
    expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on
    cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near-and
    long-term. In 2007, the Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax
    impairment charge for other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    of $50 million ($31 million, after tax) in the Other
    Specialty Products segment related to the value of a registered
    trademark.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the
    remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible
    assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and
    circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of
    amortization.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) replaced the 1991 Long Term Stock
    Incentive Plan (the “1991 Plan”) in May 2005 and
    provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various
    forms. At December 31, 2007, outstanding stock-based
    incentives were in the form of long-term stock awards, stock
    options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights.
    Additionally, the Company’s 1997 Non-Employee Directors
    Stock Plan (the “1997 Plan”) provides for the payment
    of part of the compensation to non-employee Directors in Company
    common stock. The 1997 Plan expired in May 2007; subsequently,
    compensation to non-employee Directors in Company common stock
    will be made from the 2005 Plan.

The Company elected to begin recording expense for stock options
    granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2003.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,”
    (“SFAS No. 123R”) using the Modified
    Prospective Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method
    requires the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock
    options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through
    the remaining vesting periods. The MPA method did not require
    the restatement of prior-year information. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut
    method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
    options as of the date of adoption.

Long-Term Stock
    Awards

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and
    non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share
    dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of
    repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open
    market. There was $175 million (9 million common
    shares) of total unrecognized compensation expense related to
    unvested stock awards at December 31, 2007, which was
    included as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings.
    Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized
    ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock
    awards, typically 10 years (except for stock awards held by
    grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or
    the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible
    at age 65. For stock awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized over the
    vesting period of the stock awards, typically



10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will
    become, retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the
    expense is being recognized over five years, or immediately upon
    a grantee’s retirement. Pre-tax compensation expense for
    the annual vesting of long-term stock awards was
    $52 million for 2007.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market
    price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date.
    These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over
    five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
    grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant
    date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration
    stock options, except for restoration options resulting from
    options granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration stock options
    become exercisable six months from the date of grant.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock options
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For stock options
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is
    being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period
    of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of
    time until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible at
    age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at
    January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of
    those options as calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123.
    For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, such
    expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of
    the stock options, typically five years. Pre-tax compensation
    expense for stock options was $49 million for 2007.

The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    assumptions for 2007: risk-free interest rate – 4.74%,
    dividend yield – 3.0%, volatility factor –
    31.8% and expected option life – 7 years. For
    SFAS No. 123R calculation purposes, the weighted
    average grant-date fair value of option shares, including
    restoration options, granted in 2007 was $8.92 per option share.

If the Company increased its assumptions for the risk-free
    interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the
    expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in
    2007 would increase 48 percent. If the Company decreased
    its assumptions for the risk-free interest rate and the
    volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the
    fair value of stock options granted in 2007 would decrease
    59 percent.

Employee
    Retirement Plans

Accounting for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating
    the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon
    vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the
    time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations
    of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent
    in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation,
    expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation
    increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses. The
    Company considers current market conditions, including changes
    in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in
    assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension
    costs and obligations within the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements in any given period.

In 2007, the Company increased its discount rate for obligations
    to an average of 6.25 percent from 5.50 percent. The
    discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected
    duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities
    matched to the December 31, 2007 Citigroup Pension Discount
    Curve. Such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension
    plans ranged from 5.00 percent to 6.50 percent, with
    the most significant portion of the liabilities having a
    discount rate for obligations of 6.25 percent or higher.
    The assumed asset return was primarily 8.25 percent,
    reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.

The Company’s net underfunded amount for its qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans, the difference between the
    projected benefit obligation and plan assets, decreased to
    $114 million at December 31, 2007 from
    $186 million at December 31, 2006, primarily due to
    asset returns and funding



contributions; in accordance with SFAS No. 158, the
    underfunded amount has been recognized on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007 and 2006.
    Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2007 had a net return
    of approximately seven percent compared to average returns of
    six percent for the largest 1,000 Plan Benchmark.

The Company’s projected benefit obligation for its unfunded
    non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans was
    $138 million at December 31, 2007 compared with
    $144 million at December 31, 2006; in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158, the unfunded amount has been recognized
    on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The Company expects pension expense for its qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans to be $13 million in 2008
    compared with $17 million in 2007. If the Company assumed
    that the future return on plan assets was one-half percent lower
    than the assumed asset return, the 2008 pension expense would
    increase by $3 million. The Company expects pension expense
    for its non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans to decrease
    by $1 million in 2008 compared with 2007.

Income
    Taxes

The Company has considered potential sources of future foreign
    taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a
    valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets related to
    its foreign tax credit carryforward of $45 million at
    December 31, 2007. Should the Company determine that it
    would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax
    assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be recorded in
    the period such determination is made.

Historically, the Company established reserves for tax
    contingencies in accordance with SFAS 5, “Accounting
    for Contingencies,” (“SFAS No. 5”).
    Under this standard, reserves for tax contingencies were
    established when it was probable that an additional tax may be
    owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In July 2006,
    the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109,”
    (“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48 allows
    the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a
    greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon
    examination by the taxing authorities. The adoption of
    FIN No. 48 was effective January 1, 2007.

FIN No. 48 establishes a lower threshold than
    SFAS No. 5 for recognizing reserves for income tax
    contingencies on uncertain tax positions (referred to by
    FIN No. 48 as “unrecognized tax benefits”).
    Therefore, the Company believes that there is a greater
    potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this
    lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and
    the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial
    number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits
    computation to a greater degree than with SFAS No. 5.

While the Company believes it has adequately provided for its
    uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities
    could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits. Accordingly, additional provisions for tax-related
    matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in
    income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or
    the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.

Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Certain of the Company’s products and product finishes and
    services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in
    material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to
    the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any
    changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
    servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted
    accordingly.



A significant portion of the Company’s business is at the
    consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers.
    A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
    warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not
    distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when
    they claim a return deduction from the Company. The
    Company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account
    this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are
    recorded at the time of sale.

The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary
    course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these
    matters require estimates and judgments based upon the
    professional knowledge and experience of management and its
    legal counsel. When estimates of the Company’s exposure for
    lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for
    recognition under SFAS No. 5, amounts are recorded as
    charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such
    exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent
    developments. See Note T to the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements for information regarding certain legal
    proceedings involving the Company.

Corporate
    Development Strategy

In past years, acquisitions have enabled the Company to build
    strong positions in the markets it serves and have increased the
    Company’s importance to its customers. The Company’s
    focus includes the rationalization of its business units,
    including consolidations, as well as pursuing synergies among
    the Company’s business units. The Company expects to
    maintain a more balanced growth strategy with emphasis on
    organic growth, share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with
    increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital.
    As part of its strategic planning, the Company continues to
    review all of its businesses to determine which businesses may
    not be core to the Company’s long-term growth strategy.

During 2007, the Company completed the sale of a European
    business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products segment.
    In 2006, the Company completed the sale of a North American
    business unit in the Other Specialty Products segment. These
    dispositions were completed pursuant to the Company’s
    determination that these business units were not core to the
    Company’s long-term growth strategy. The Company recognized
    a net loss of $10 million in 2007, primarily related to the
    2007 discontinued operation. The Company recognized a net gain
    of $50 million in 2006, primarily related to the 2006
    discontinued operation.

During 2005, in separate transactions, the Company completed the
    sale of three business units in Europe, including two in the
    Cabinets and Related Products segment and one in the Other
    Specialty Products segment, as well as one business unit in
    North America in the Cabinets and Related Products segment. The
    Company recognized a net gain of $63 million in 2005,
    primarily related to the 2005 discontinued operations.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the
    Company accounted for the business units which were sold in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, except as noted below, as discontinued
    operations. There were no businesses held for sale at
    December 31, 2007.

The sales, results of operations and the (losses) gains from the
    2007, 2006 and 2005 discontinued operations were included in
    (loss) income from discontinued operations, net, in the
    consolidated statements of income.

During 2007 and 2006, the Company completed the sale of several
    small businesses, primarily in the Plumbing Products segment,
    the results of which were included in continuing operations
    through the dates of sale. The Company received cash proceeds of
    $10 million and $72 million, respectively, and
    recognized a pre-tax net (loss) gain of $(8) million and
    $1 million, respectively, for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, included in other, net, in
    continuing operations, related to the 2007 and 2006 sales of
    business units.

During 2007, the Company acquired several relatively small
    installation service businesses (Installation and Other Services
    segment), as well as Erickson Construction Company and Guy
    Evans, Inc.



(Installation and Other Services segment). Erickson Construction
    Company, headquartered in Arizona, provides pre-fabricated wall
    panels and millwork for residential builders in Arizona,
    California and Nevada. Guy Evans, Inc., headquartered in
    California, is an installer of millwork, doors, windows and bath
    hardware for residential builders in California and Nevada.
    These two acquisitions allow the Company to expand the products
    and services it offers to its installation customers, and had
    combined annual sales in 2006 of approximately
    $200 million. The results of these acquisitions are
    included in the consolidated financial statement from the
    respective dates of acquisition. The aggregate net purchase
    price for all of these acquisitions was $202 million and
    included cash of $195 million and assumed debt of
    $7 million.

During 2006 and 2005, the Company acquired several relatively
    small businesses (primarily in the Installation and Other
    Services segment). The results of these acquisitions are
    included in the consolidated financial statements from the
    respective dates of acquisition.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through
    cash provided by a combination of its operations, long-term bank
    debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by
    the issuance of Company common stock, including issuances for
    certain mergers and acquisitions.

Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of
    funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had a
    $2.0 billion

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of banks syndicated in
    the United States and internationally which expires in February
    2011. This agreement allows for borrowings denominated in
    U.S. dollars or European euros with interest payable based
    upon various floating-rate options as selected by the Company.
    There were no amounts outstanding under the

5-year

Revolving Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007.

The

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement contains limitations on additional
    borrowings; at December 31, 2007, the Company had
    additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to
    $1.9 billion. The

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a requirement for
    maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31,
    2007, the Company’s net worth exceeded such requirement by
    $895 million.

The Company had cash and cash investments of $922 million
    at December 31, 2007 principally as a result of strong cash
    flows from operations.

The Company has maintained investments in available-for-sale and
    marketable securities and a number of private equity funds,
    principally as part of its tax planning strategies, as any gains
    enhance the utilization of any current and future tax capital
    losses. The Company determined that the longer maturity of
    private equity funds would be advantageous to the Company and
    complement the Company’s investment in more liquid
    available-for-sale and marketable securities to balance risk.
    Since the Company has significantly reduced tax capital losses
    in part by generating capital gains from investments and other
    sources, the Company has and will continue to reduce its
    investments in financial assets.

In 2007, the Company increased its quarterly common stock
    dividend five percent to $.23 per common share. This marks the
    49th consecutive year in which dividends have been
    increased.

Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the
    Company’s financial strategies. The Company’s total
    debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to
    50 percent at December 31, 2007 from 53 percent
    at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the Company’s
    debt to total capitalization percent is primarily due to the
    repurchase of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes in
    January 2007.

On January 20, 2007, holders of $1.8 billion
    (94 percent) principal amount at maturity of the
    Company’s Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes
    (“Notes”) required the Company to repurchase their
    Notes at a cash value of $825 million. At December 31,
    2007, there were outstanding $108 million principal amount
    at maturity of such Notes, with an accreted value of
    $52 million, which has been



included in long-term debt, as the next put option date is
    July 20, 2011. The Company may at any time redeem all or
    part of the Notes at their then accreted value.

During 2007, the Company also retired $300 million of
    floating-rate notes due March 9, 2007 and $300 million
    of 4.625% notes due August 15, 2007. On March 14,
    2007, the Company issued $300 million of floating-rate
    notes due 2010; the interest rate is determined based upon the
    three-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points. On March 14,
    2007, the Company also issued $300 million of fixed-rate
    5.85% notes due 2017. These debt issuances provided net
    proceeds of $596 million and were in consideration of the
    March and August 2007 debt maturities.

The Company’s working capital ratio was 2.0 to 1 and 1.5 to
    1 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    improvement in the Company’s working capital ratio is
    primarily due to the January 2007 payment of $825 million
    to repurchase the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes which
    were included in short-term notes payable at December 31,
    2006.

The derivatives used by the Company during 2007 consist of
    interest rate swaps entered into in 2004, for the purpose of
    effectively converting a portion of fixed-rate debt to
    variable-rate debt. Generally, under interest rate swap
    agreements, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange
    the difference between fixed-rate and variable-rate interest
    amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal
    amount. The derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy
    institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. The
    interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair-value
    hedges, and the interest rate differential on interest rate
    swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment
    to interest expense over the term of the agreement. For
    fair-value hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are
    recognized in determining earnings.

The average variable interest rates are based upon the London
    Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus fixed adjustment
    factors. The average effective rate for 2007 on the interest
    rate swaps was 6.264%. At December 31, 2007, the interest
    rate swap agreements covered a notional amount of
    $850 million of the Company’s fixed-rate debt due
    July 15, 2012 with an interest rate of 5.875%. The hedges
    are considered 100 percent effective because all of the
    critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match
    those of the hedged item. Accordingly, no gain or loss on the
    value of the hedges was recognized in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of income for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. In 2007, the Company
    recognized an increase in interest expense of $3 million
    related to this swap agreement, due to increasing interest rates.

Certain of the Company’s European operations also entered
    into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of
    managing exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to
    the European euro, the Great Britain pound and the
    U.S. dollar.

The Company’s cash and cash investments decreased
    $1.0 billion to $922 million at December 31,
    2007, from $1,958 million at December 31, 2006.

Net cash provided by operations of $1.3 billion consisted
    primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash and certain other
    items, including depreciation and amortization expense of
    $248 million, net loss on disposition of businesses of
    $18 million, net gain on disposition of financial
    investments of $41 million, a $227 million charge for
    the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, a
    $22 million charge for the impairment of financial
    investments and other non-cash items, including stock-based
    compensation expense, amortization expense related to in-store
    displays and interest expense on the Zero Coupon Convertible
    Senior Notes, as well as a net decrease in working capital of
    $283 million.

The Company continues to emphasize balance sheet management,
    including working capital management and cash flow generation.
    Days sales in accounts receivable were 49 days at
    December 31, 2007 compared with 50 days at
    December 31, 2006, and days sales in inventories were
    48 days at December 31, 2007 compared with
    49 days at December 31, 2006. Accounts payable days
    improved to 43 days from 40 days at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Working capital (defined as
    accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) as a
    percent of sales was 15.4 percent and 16.1 percent at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Net cash used for financing activities was $2.0 billion,
    and included cash outflows of $347 million for cash
    dividends paid, $1,425 million for the retirement of notes
    and $857 million for the acquisition and retirement of
    31 million shares of Company common stock in open-market
    transactions. Cash provided by financing activities primarily
    included $596 million from the issuance of notes (net of
    issuance costs) and $60 million from the issuance of
    Company common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock
    options.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had remaining Board of
    Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to an additional
    41 million shares of its common stock in open-market
    transactions or otherwise. In January 2008, the Company
    repurchased an additional three million shares of Company common
    stock and expects to continue its share repurchase program
    throughout 2008.



Net cash used for investing activities was $347 million,
    and included $248 million for capital expenditures and
    $203 million for acquisitions. Cash provided by investing
    activities included primarily $45 million of net proceeds
    from the disposition of businesses and $108 million from
    the net sale of financial investments.

The Company invests in automating its manufacturing operations
    to increase its productivity to improve customer service.
    Capital expenditures for 2007 were $248 million, compared
    with $388 million for 2006 and $282 million for 2005;
    for 2008, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2008
    acquisitions, are expected to approximate $240 million.
    Depreciation and amortization expense for 2007 totaled
    $248 million, compared with $244 million for 2006 and
    $241 million for 2005; for 2008, depreciation and
    amortization expense, excluding any potential 2008 acquisitions,
    is expected to approximate $260 million. Amortization
    expense totaled $20 million, $14 million and
    $28 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with
    existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor,
    in the opinion of the Company, are they expected to have, a
    material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures,
    financial position or results of operations.

The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash
    flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near-term
    working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes
    that its longer-term working capital and other general corporate
    requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from
    operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings,
    future financial market activities and proceeds from asset sales.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in
    the United States. However, the Company believes that certain
    non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the
    business, may provide users of this financial information with
    additional meaningful comparisons between current results and
    results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and
    ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an
    alternative for, the Company’s reported results.

Sales and
    Operations

Net sales for 2007 were $11.8 billion, representing a
    decrease of seven percent from 2006. Excluding results from
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales
    decreased 11 percent compared with 2006. The following
    table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions:

Net sales for 2007 were adversely affected by a continued
    decline in the new home construction market, which reduced sales
    volume, and contributed to a nine percent decline in net sales.
    Economic conditions remain difficult in the new home
    construction market. Full-year housing starts have declined from
    2.1 million in 2005 to 1.3 million in 2007. Net sales
    for 2007 were also negatively affected by a decline in consumer
    spending for home improvement products, which contributed to
    lower sales volume, reducing net sales by two percent compared
    to 2006. Retail sales volume benefited from increased sales
    volume of paints and stains and International plumbing products.



The Company’s gross profit margins were 27.3 percent,
    27.6 percent and 28.5 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The decrease in the 2007 gross profit margin
    reflects lower sales volume of certain products, which more than
    offset the benefits associated with the Company’s business
    rationalizations and other initiatives. The decrease in the
    2006 gross profit margins reflects increased commodity,
    energy and freight costs, as well as a less favorable product
    mix, offset in part by increased selling prices for certain
    products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
    sales were 17.2 percent in 2007 compared with
    16.1 percent in 2006 and 15.5 percent in 2005.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2007 reflect
    lower sales volume, as well as increased advertising costs of
    2.9 percent of sales compared to 2.6 percent of sales
    in 2006. The year 2007 also includes increased severance costs
    of $16 million, increased bad debt expense of
    $13 million and increased systems implementation costs of
    $7 million, which, on a combined basis, increased
    .3 percent of sales compared to 2006. Increased selling,
    general and administrative expenses in 2006, compared to 2005,
    reflect increased stock-based compensation expense of
    .8 percent of sales compared to .6 percent of sales in
    2005, in part reflecting the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, and increased information systems
    implementation costs and other expenses.

Operating profit in 2007, 2006 and 2005 includes
    $79 million, $47 million and $12 million,
    respectively, of costs and charges related to the Company’s
    business rationalizations and other initiatives. Operating
    profit in 2007, 2006 and 2005 includes $227 million,
    $317 million and $43 million, respectively, of
    impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets.
    Operating profit in 2006 and 2005 includes $1 million and
    $6 million, respectively, of income regarding the Behr
    litigation settlement. Operating profit margins, as reported,
    were 8.1 percent, 9.0 percent and 12.7 percent in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating profit margins,
    excluding the items above, were 10.7 percent,
    11.8 percent and 13.1 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Operating profit margins in 2007 were adversely affected by a
    continuing decline in new home construction and a moderation in
    consumer spending in North America, both of which negatively
    impacted the sales volume of installation and other services,
    assembled cabinets and windows and doors; such sales volume
    declines negatively impacted operating profit margin by
    1.6 percentage points compared to 2006. Operating profit
    margins benefited from the Company’s business
    rationalizations and other initiatives. Operating profit margins
    in 2006 were negatively affected by an accelerating decline in
    the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer
    spending for certain “big ticket” home improvement
    items, such as cabinets, in the last half of 2006, both of which
    negatively impacted the sales volume of certain products and
    reduced operating profit margin by approximately one percent in
    2006 compared to 2005. Operating profit margins in 2006 were
    also affected by the continuing negative impact of higher
    commodity costs partially offset by certain selling price
    increases. Operating profit margins in 2005 were impacted by
    increased commodity, energy and freight costs, which had only
    been partially offset by selling price increases.

Other Income
    (Expense), Net

During 2007, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges aggregating $22 million related to financial
    investments in Furniture Brands International common stock
    ($6 million), Asahi Tec common stock ($3 million),
    auction rate securities ($3 million) and private equity
    funds ($10 million).

Other, net, for 2007 included $5 million of realized gains,
    net, from the sale of marketable securities, $6 million of
    dividend income and $38 million of income from other
    investments, net. Other, net, for 2007 also included
    $9 million of realized currency gains and other
    miscellaneous items.

During 2006, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges aggregating $101 million for its investments
    related to Metaldyne ($40 million), TriMas
    ($16 million), the Heartland fund ($29 million) and
    other funds ($16 million).



Other, net, for 2006 included $4 million of realized gains,
    net, from the sale of marketable securities, $10 million of
    dividend income and $30 million of income from other
    investments, net. Other, net, for 2006 also included realized
    currency gains of $14 million and other miscellaneous items.

During 2005, the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges aggregating $45 million primarily related to its
    investment in Furniture Brands International common stock
    ($30 million) and private equity funds ($15 million).

Other, net, for 2005 included $30 million of realized
    gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities,
    $16 million of dividend income and $69 million of
    income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2005 also
    included realized currency losses of $25 million and other
    miscellaneous items.

Interest expense was $258 million, $240 million and
    $247 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    increase in interest expense in 2007 is primarily due to
    increasing interest rates and the issuance of higher interest
    rate debt of 6.125% notes in October 2006 and floating-rate
    notes and 5.85% notes in March 2007. These debt issuances
    were in consideration of the 2007 debt payments. The decrease in
    interest expense in 2006 is primarily the result of the
    repayment of $800 million of 6.75% notes in March
    2006, partially offset by the issuance of $1 billion of
    6.125% notes in October 2006, as well as the impact of
    increasing interest rates.

Income and
    Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing
    Operations

Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing
    operations for 2007 were $397 million and $1.06 per common
    share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2007
    included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and
    other intangible assets of $227 million ($208 million
    or $.56 per common share, after tax). Income and diluted
    earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2006
    were $478 million and $1.20 per common share, respectively.
    Income from continuing operations for 2006 included non-cash,
    pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill of $317 million
    ($317 million or $.79 per common share, after tax). Income
    and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations
    for 2005 were $889 million and $2.07 per common share,
    respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2005
    included non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill of
    $43 million ($43 million or $.10 per common share,
    after tax) and income regarding the litigation settlement of
    $6 million pre-tax ($4 million or $.01 per common
    share, after tax).

The Company’s effective tax rate for income from continuing
    operations was 44 percent, 45 percent, and
    36 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    increased tax rates in 2007 and 2006 are primarily due to the
    impairment charges for goodwill not being deductible for tax
    purposes. The Company’s effective tax rate for income from
    continuing operations, excluding the impairment charges for
    goodwill and other intangible assets, was 36 percent,
    33 percent and 35 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

The Company estimates that its effective tax rate should
    approximate 42 to 43 percent in 2008. The expected tax rate
    for 2008 is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the
    U.S. tax on anticipated dividend distributions from certain
    foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are taxed at rates less than
    the U.S. Federal rate of 35 percent. These dividends
    are being distributed to utilize certain favorable provisions of
    the U.S. income tax law that are scheduled to expire at
    December 31, 2008. The majority of the U.S. tax
    currently payable on these dividends will be offset by the
    Company’s $45 million foreign tax credit carryforward;
    such utilization of the foreign tax credit carryforward will be
    accounted for as a reversal of the $45 million deferred tax
    asset.



Outlook for the
    Company

Economic conditions remain difficult in a number of the
    Company’s markets. Housing starts declined 25 percent
    in 2007 due to excessive inventories of homes and less
    attractive mortgage terms. As a result, full-year 2007 housing
    starts declined to 1.3 million from 2.1 million in
    2005 and the Company expects a further decline in housing starts
    in 2008. In addition, the Company anticipates a decline in
    consumer spending for home improvement products and,
    notwithstanding recent actions by the Federal Reserve and the
    government to stimulate economic growth, the Company believes
    that 2008 will be a difficult year for the overall
    U.S. economy. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company
    also experienced a softening of demand for certain of its
    International products due to declining European economies.

The Company expects market conditions in its industry, in the
    next several quarters, to be very challenging. The Company is
    confident of its strategy of dividend increases and share
    repurchases while concentrating on organic growth, improving
    returns and generating superior cash flow. The Company’s
    strategy, together with the leveraging of the combined market
    strength of its retail service, distribution and installation
    capabilities, brands and scale, should allow Masco to continue
    to drive long-term growth and value for its shareholders.

Business Segment
    Results Discussion

Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business
    Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general
    corporate expense, net, gains on sale of corporate fixed assets,
    net, income regarding the litigation settlement, and impairment
    charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2007, 2006
    and 2005.

Business
    Rationalizations and Other Initiatives

Over the past several years, the Company has been focused on the
    rationalization of its businesses, including sourcing programs,
    business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions,
    plant

start-ups,

systems implementations and other initiatives. For the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the Company incurred net costs and
    charges of $79 million related to these initiatives, net of
    an $8 million gain from the sale of fixed assets.

During 2006, the Company incurred $39 million pre-tax of
    costs and charges (primarily accelerated depreciation and
    severance expense) related to a plant closure and other profit
    improvement programs in the Plumbing Products segment. In
    addition, in 2006, the Company incurred $8 million pre-tax
    of costs and charges (including the write-down of inventories
    and accelerated depreciation) related to the closure of a
    relatively small ready-to-assemble cabinet manufacturing
    facility in the Cabinets and Related Products segment. In 2005,
    the Company also incurred approximately $12 million pre-tax
    of charges related to headcount reductions and the
    discontinuance of a product line in the Plumbing Products
    segment.

Cabinets and
    Related Products

Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased in 2007
    primarily due to a decline in sales volume of assembled cabinets
    in the new home construction market, which reduced sales in this
    segment by 11 percent compared to 2006. A decline in net
    sales of ready-to-assemble cabinets reduced sales in this
    segment by five percent in 2007 compared to 2006. A weaker
    U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of
    local currencies of European operations included in this segment
    and increased sales by two percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Net
    sales in this segment decreased in 2006 primarily due to lower
    sales of ready-to-assemble cabinets in North America and Europe,
    which more than offset certain selling price increases and sales
    volume increases of assembled cabinets in North America in the
    first half of 2006. Net sales in this segment in 2005 were
    affected by increased sales volume in the new construction
    market, as well as certain selling price increases.

Operating profit margins in the Cabinets and Related Products
    segment were negatively affected by the decline in sales volume
    in 2007, which reduced operating profit margin by three
    percentage points, as well as increased

start-up

costs and the under-utilization of two new plants in this
    segment, and increased severance costs. Such declines were
    partially offset by a gain on the sale of a manufacturing
    facility of $8 million and benefits associated with
    business rationalizations and other initiatives. In 2006,
    operating profit margins in this segment were negatively
    affected by a decline in sales volume in the last half of the
    year, as well as increased commodity, freight and plant

start-up

costs and lower results of European operations, offset in part
    by selling price increases. In 2006, operating profit margins in
    this segment were also negatively affected by $8 million of
    costs and charges related to the closure of a relatively small
    ready-to-assemble cabinet manufacturing facility. Operating
    profit margins in 2005 reflect increased commodity and freight
    costs and manufacturing and distribution inefficiencies in North
    America, as well as a shift to a less favorable product mix,
    which offset the positive impact of higher unit sales volume.

Plumbing
    Products

Net sales of Plumbing Products increased in 2007 and 2006
    primarily due to increased sales volume of certain European
    operations, which increased sales in this segment by three
    percent in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2007, increased selling
    prices also increased sales in this segment by three percent
    compared to



2006. These results were partially offset by declining sales
    volume to North American retail and wholesale customers, which
    reduced sales in this segment by four percent in 2007 compared
    to 2006. A weaker U.S. dollar also had a positive effect on
    the translation of local currencies of European operations
    included in this segment and increased sales by four percent in
    2007 compared to 2006 and increased sales by one percent in 2006
    compared to 2005. Net sales in this segment in 2005 were
    affected by increased sales through the Company’s wholesale
    distribution channel and the increased sales of certain European
    operations included in this segment.

Operating profit margins in the Plumbing Products segment in
    2007 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs in
    early 2007, which reduced operating profit margin by
    1.7 percentage points compared to 2006. Such declines were
    partially offset by selling price increases and the reduction of
    certain variable expenses. Operating profit margins in this
    segment were adversely affected by costs and charges aggregating
    $39 million and $12 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, related to certain profit improvement initiatives;
    excluding such charges, operating profit margins in this segment
    would have been 9.7 percent and 12.2 percent in 2006
    and 2005, respectively. In 2006, operating profit margins in
    this segment were negatively affected by increased commodity
    costs, as well as a less favorable product mix and declining
    sales volume to certain retail customers. Operating profit
    margins in 2005 were affected by increased commodity costs,
    which were not offset by selling price increases and a less
    favorable product mix, which more than offset increased sales
    volume in the wholesale distribution channel.

The Company’s Plumbing Products segment continues to be
    negatively impacted by import competition, as well as a product
    mix shift towards lower-margin faucets within the North American
    retail channels. As part of the Company’s strategic review
    of its businesses, the Company determined that in order to
    remain competitive, it is necessary to increase off-shore
    sourcing at lower costs, while consolidating and reducing
    manufacturing operations in North America. Consistent with this
    determination, in 2006, the Company closed a North American
    plant in this segment.

Installation
    and Other Services

Net sales of Installation and Other Services decreased in 2007
    primarily due to lower sales volume related to the continued
    slowdown in the new home construction market, which reduced
    sales in this segment by 20 percent compared to 2006 and
    declines in selling prices, partially offset by acquisitions
    which increased sales in this segment by six percent compared to
    2006. Net sales in this segment increased in 2006 primarily due
    to increased sales volume of non-insulation products and selling
    price increases in the first half of 2006. However, the slowdown
    in the new home construction market significantly reduced sales
    in the second half of 2006 compared to 2005. Net sales in this
    segment in 2005 were affected by increased selling prices, as
    well as increased sales volume of non-insulation products and
    strength in the new home construction market.

Operating profit margins in the Installation and Other Services
    segment were lower in 2007 primarily due to lower sales volume
    and the related under-absorption of fixed costs, which decreased
    operating profit margin in this segment by approximately three
    percentage points compared to 2006, and lower selling prices.
    The year 2007 also included increased bad debt expense,
    increased severance and location closure costs and increased
    systems implementation expenses, which, on a combined basis,
    reduced operating profit margin in this segment by one
    percentage point compared to 2006. Partially offsetting these
    declines were reductions in material costs, as well as benefits
    associated with the business rationalizations and other
    initiatives. In 2006, the operating profit margin decline in
    this segment was primarily attributable to increased sales
    volume of generally lower-margin, non-insulation products, as
    well as increased operating costs to support the segment’s
    growth in non-insulation products, new product development and
    technology initiatives. Operating profit margins in 2005 were
    affected by increases in sales of generally lower-margin,
    non-insulation products, as well as the time lag in implementing
    selling price increases related to material cost increases,
    partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volume.



Decorative
    Architectural Products

Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased in 2007
    primarily due to higher retail sales volume from new product
    introductions of paints and stains, which increased sales in
    this segment by four percent compared to 2006, which was
    partially offset by sales declines related to builder’s
    hardware. Net sales in this segment increased in 2006 primarily
    due to selling price increases of paints and stains. Net sales
    in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to increased
    sales volume of paints and stains.

Operating profit margins in the Decorative Architectural
    Products segment in 2007 primarily reflect increased sales
    volume of paints and stains, offset by increased advertising
    expenses. In 2006, operating profit margins in this segment
    improved due to increased selling prices of paints and stains,
    which partially offset commodity cost increases experienced in
    late 2004 and during 2005. Operating profit margins in this
    segment in 2005 were impacted by increased material and freight
    costs, which were not completely offset by increased selling
    prices related to paints and stains.

Other
    Specialty Products

Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased principally due
    to lower sales volume of windows and doors, primarily resulting
    from the continued slowdown in the new home construction market,
    particularly in the Western United States, which decreased sales
    in this segment by 14 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 and
    four percent in 2006 compared to 2005. A weaker U.S. dollar
    had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of
    European operations included in this segment and increased sales
    by two percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Net sales in this
    segment in 2005 were affected by increased sales volume and
    certain selling price increases of windows and doors to the
    North American new home construction market, partially offset by
    reduced sales of European operations included in this segment.

Operating profit margins in the Other Specialty Products segment
    declined in 2007 due to lower sales volume of windows and doors
    in the new home construction market, which decreased operating
    profit margin by 3.2 percentage points compared to 2006,
    and lower results of European operations, which reduced
    operating profit by 1.6 percentage points compared to 2006.
    Operating profit margins in this segment declined in 2006 due to
    lower sales volume of windows and doors, which offset improved
    European operating results. Operating profit margins in this
    segment in 2005 were affected by increased commodity costs and
    the lower results of European operations, reflecting charges
    related to profit improvement initiatives, offset in part by
    reduced state use tax expense.

Geographic Area
    Results Discussion

North
    America

Net sales from North American operations decreased in 2007
    primarily due to the continued decline in the new home
    construction market, which declined 25 percent in 2007
    compared to 2006 and a decline in consumer spending for home
    improvement products. North American sales in 2007 were
    negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and
    other services, assembled cabinets and windows and doors in the
    new home construction market which decreased sales from North
    American operations by 11 percent compared to 2006. In
    addition, North American net sales were negatively affected by
    lower retail sales volume of certain products, partially offset
    by increased retail sales volume of paint and stains, which
    aggregated a net decrease to sales from North American
    operations of one percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Net sales
    from North American operations increased slightly in 2006
    benefiting from relatively stronger market conditions in the
    first half of 2006, as well as increased selling prices. An
    accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a
    moderation in consumer spending reduced sales volume in the
    second half of 2006 particularly for assembled cabinets, windows
    and doors and sales of insulation products. Net sales from North
    American operations in 2005 were affected by the strength in the
    new home construction market and increased sales volume of
    cabinets, installation sales of insulation and non-insulation
    products, and sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio
    doors, as well as increased selling prices for certain products.



In North America, the Company manufactures products (principally
    windows, doors and cabinets) and provides installation of
    insulation and other services to homebuilders. The Company has
    relationships with 90 of the top 100 builders in the United
    States. The Company has seen an increase in bad debt expense,
    related to homebuilders, from $7 million in 2006 to
    $22 million in 2007. The Company monitors its customer
    receivable balances and the credit worthiness of its customers
    on an ongoing basis. Currently, the top ten
    U.S. homebuilders represent less than three percent of the
    Company’s consolidated receivable balance of
    $1.4 billion.

The decline in operating profit margin from North American
    operations in 2007 is primarily due to declines in new home
    construction and consumer spending, which negatively impacted
    the sales volume of certain products, and decreased operating
    profit margin by two percentage points compared to 2006. The
    declines in 2007 were partially offset by selling price
    increases, and the benefits associated with the Company’s
    business rationalizations and other initiatives. In 2006, the
    operating profit margins declined from North American operations
    due to sales volume declines in the second half of 2006 of

ready-to-assemble

cabinets, windows and doors and the installation of insulation
    products. Operating profit margins in 2006 were also negatively
    affected by increased commodity costs, partially offset by
    selling price increases. Operating profit margins in 2005 were
    impacted by continued increases in commodity, energy, freight
    and other petroleum-based product costs, which were only
    partially offset by selling price increases, and increased sales
    volume of cabinets, installation services and windows and patio
    doors to the new home construction market.

International,
    Principally Europe

Net sales from International operations increased in 2007
    primarily due to increased sales volume of plumbing products
    which increased sales from International operations in local
    currencies by five percent compared to 2006. A weaker
    U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of
    International results in 2007, increasing International net
    sales by ten percent compared to 2006. Net sales from
    International operations increased in 2006 primarily due to
    increased sales of plumbing products, which increased sales from
    International operations in local currencies by six percent
    compared to 2005. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive
    effect on the translation of European results, increasing
    European net sales by one percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Net
    sales from International operations in 2005 were affected by the
    increased local currency sales of exported plumbing products and
    ready-to-assemble cabinets, offset in part by declining sales of
    windows and other plumbing products.

Operating profit margins in 2007 were negatively affected by a
    less favorable product mix and material cost increases.
    Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by the
    lower operating results for European ready-to-assemble cabinets,
    which more than offset the positive effect of increased sales
    volume of plumbing products and improved operating results of
    other European operations. Operating profit margins in 2005 were
    negatively affected by increased commodity costs and costs
    associated with certain profit improvement initiatives, as well
    as a less favorable product mix.

    Matters

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

Information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company is
    set forth in Note T to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Other
    Commitments

With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity
    funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2007, commitments
    to contribute up to $49 million of additional capital to
    such funds, representing the Company’s aggregate capital
    commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to
    date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional
    capital contributions to its private equity funds upon receipt
    of a capital call from the private equity fund. The Company has
    no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital
    calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in
    the carrying value of the Company’s investment in the
    private equity fund when paid.

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and
    customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries
    in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims made
    against builders by homeowners for issues relating to the
    Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with
    divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally
    provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to
    various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks;
    legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns;
    and asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a
    material amount related to these indemnifications, and evaluates
    the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately
    records an estimated liability when probable.

Recently Issued
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,”
    (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 is effective January 1,
    2008 for financial assets and liabilities and is not expected to
    have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is
    effective January 1, 2009 for non-financial assets and
    liabilities, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact
    these provisions will have on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities – Including an Amendment of
    SFAS No. 115,”
    (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 is optional and is effective
    January 1, 2008. The Company has elected not to adopt
    SFAS No. 159.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS No. 141R
    requires that the acquisition method be applied to all business
    combinations and it establishes requirements for the recognition
    and measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities by the



acquiring company. Further, it requires that costs incurred to
    complete any acquisition be recognized as expense in the
    consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 141R also
    requires that contingent assets and liabilities be recorded at
    fair value and marked to market quarterly until they are
    settled, with any changes to the fair value to be recorded as
    income or expense in the consolidated statement of income.
    SFAS No. 141R is effective for any business
    combinations that are completed subsequent to January 1,
    2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the
    provisions of SFAS No. 141R will have on its
    consolidated financial statements and its method of accounting
    for business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160
    requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties
    other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and
    presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a component of
    shareholders’ equity. It also requires the amount of
    consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the consolidated statement of income.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective January 1, 2009, and
    the Company is currently evaluating the impact of this
    pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting
    Release No. 48, “Disclosure of Accounting Policies for
    Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity
    Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative
    Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial
    Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative
    Commodity Instruments.”

The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest
    rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course
    of business and to market price fluctuations related to its
    marketable securities and other investments. The Company has
    limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and
    uses such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure
    to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency
    fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information regarding the
    Company’s derivative instruments.

The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 consist of interest rate swap agreements
    entered into in 2004 for the purpose of effectively converting a
    portion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The Company,
    including certain European operations, also entered into foreign
    currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency
    fluctuations related primarily to the European euro, the Great
    Britain pound and the U.S. dollar.

At December 31, 2007, the Company performed sensitivity
    analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of
    market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical
    change of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a
    10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a
    10 percent decline in the market value of the
    Company’s long-term investments. Based upon the analyses
    performed, such changes would not be expected to materially
    affect the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Masco Corporation is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Masco Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

The management of Masco Corporation assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2007 using the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in “Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework.” Based on this assessment, management has
    determined that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, performed an audit of the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of
    Masco Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007. Their report expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Masco
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007 and expressed an unqualified opinion
    on the Company’s 2007 consolidated financial statements.
    This report appears under Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data under the heading Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Masco Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Masco
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note R to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    unrecognized tax benefits in 2007. As discussed in Note M
    to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
    its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in 2006.
    In addition, as discussed in Note N to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans effective December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Masco Corporation
    and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
    consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations
    of variable interest entities, for which the Company is the
    primary beneficiary, in accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 46 – Revised, “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities.”

Use of Estimates and Assumptions in the Preparation of
    Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to
    make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
    these estimates and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue
    as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to
    customers or when services are rendered, net of applicable
    provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. The Company
    records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon
    estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other
    Services segment; such amounts are recorded in receivables.
    Amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in net
    sales, while costs incurred for shipping and handling are
    included in cost of sales.

Customer Promotion Costs.

The Company records
    estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and
    incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative
    advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based
    incentives. In-store displays that are owned by the Company and
    used to market the Company’s products are included in other
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized
    using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of
    three years; related amortization expense is classified as a
    selling expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Foreign Currency.

The financial statements of the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local
    currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
    these subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates as of the
    balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at
    average exchange rates in effect during the year. The resulting
    cumulative translation adjustments have been recorded in the
    accumulated other comprehensive income component of
    shareholders’ equity. Realized foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of
    income in other income (expense), net.

Cash and Cash Investments.

The Company considers all
    highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three
    months or less to be cash and cash investments.

Receivables.

The Company does significant business
    with a number of customers, including certain home centers and
    homebuilders. The Company monitors its exposure for credit
    losses and records related allowances for doubtful accounts.
    Allowances are estimated based upon specific customer balances,
    where a risk of default has been identified, and also include a
    provision for non-customer specific defaults based upon
    historical collection, return and write-off activity. A separate
    allowance is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is
    generally based upon sales activity. Receivables are presented
    net of certain allowances (including allowances for doubtful
    accounts) of $85 million and $84 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Receivables
    include unbilled revenue related to the Installation and Other
    Services segment of $31 million and $40 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment,
    including significant betterments to existing facilities, are
    recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal, the cost and
    accumulated depreciation



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Continued)

are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included
    in the consolidated statements of income. Maintenance and repair
    costs are charged against earnings as incurred.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense is computed
    principally using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets. Annual depreciation rates are as
    follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10 percent,
    and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation
    expense was $226 million, $228 million and
    $207 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” requires
    goodwill and other intangible assets to be tested for impairment
    annually and under certain circumstances. The Company performs
    such testing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or
    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying
    amount. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting
    business units to the carrying value of the reporting business
    units for goodwill impairment testing. Fair value is determined
    using a discounted cash flow method.

The Company reviews its other indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances
    change that indicate the assets may be impaired. The Company
    considers the implications of both external (e.g., market
    growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal
    (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and
    their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible
    asset in both the near- and long-term.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using
    the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The
    Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable
    identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to
    determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to
    the remaining periods of amortization. See Note H for
    additional information regarding Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Derivative
    Instruments.

The carrying value of financial
    instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets for
    current assets, current liabilities and long-term floating-rate
    debt approximates fair value. The fair value of financial
    instruments that are carried as non-current investments is based
    principally upon information from investment fund managers and
    other assumptions, on quoted market prices for those or similar
    investments, by estimating the fair value of consideration to be
    received or by discounting future cash flows using a discount
    rate that reflects the risk of the underlying investments. The
    fair value of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate debt
    instruments is based principally upon quoted market prices for
    the same or similar issues or the current rates available to the
    Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
    The aggregate estimated market value of non-current investments
    and long-term debt at December 31, 2007 was approximately
    $150 million and $4,073 million, compared with the
    aggregate carrying value of $150 million and
    $3,966 million, respectively. The aggregate estimated
    market value of non-current investments and long-term debt at
    December 31, 2006 was approximately $246 million and
    $3,616 million, compared with the aggregate carrying value
    of $246 million and $3,533 million, respectively.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage
    certain exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows
    resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
    interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in
    the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability
    measured at fair value. For each derivative financial instrument
    that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge, the gain
    or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting
    loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk,
    are recognized in determining current earnings during the period
    of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments not
    designated as hedging



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Continued)

instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in determining
    current earnings during the period of the change in fair value.

Warranty.

At the time of sale, the Company accrues a
    warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products,
    parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction
    of warranty obligations. The Company’s estimate of costs to
    service its warranty obligations is based upon historical
    experience and expectations of future conditions.

A significant portion of the Company’s business is at the
    consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers.
    A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a
    warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not
    distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when
    they claim a return deduction from the Company. The
    Company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account
    this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are
    recorded at the time of sale.

Product Liability.

The Company provides for expenses
    associated with product liability obligations when such amounts
    are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are
    adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change
    that would effect the estimated liability.

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company elected to
    change its method of accounting for stock-based compensation and
    implemented the fair value method prescribed by
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation,” effective January 1, 2003. The Company
    used the prospective method, as defined by
    SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation – Transition and Disclosure –
    an amendment to SFAS No. 123,” for determining
    stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, options granted,
    modified or settled subsequent to January 1, 2003 have been
    accounted for using the fair value method and options granted
    prior to January 1, 2003 were accounted for using the
    intrinsic value method.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,”
    (“SFAS No. 123R”) using the Modified
    Prospective Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method
    requires the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock
    options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through
    the remaining vesting periods. The MPA method did not require
    the restatement of prior-year information. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut
    method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
    options as of the date of adoption.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior-year amounts have
    been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation in the
    consolidated financial statements. The results of operations
    related to 2007, 2006 and 2005 discontinued operations have been
    reclassified and separately stated in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income for 2007, 2006 and 2005. In
    the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, the
    cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately
    classified.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In
    September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,”
    (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 is effective January 1,
    2008 for financial assets and liabilities and is not expected to
    have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is
    effective January 1, 2009 for non-financial assets and
    liabilities, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact
    these provisions will have on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities – Including an Amendment of
    SFAS No. 115,”
    (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 is optional and is effective
    January 1, 2008. The Company has elected not to adopt
    SFAS No. 159.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS No. 141R
    requires that the acquisition method be applied to all business
    combinations and it establishes requirements for the recognition
    and measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities by the
    acquiring company. Further, it requires that costs incurred to
    complete any acquisition be recognized as expense in the
    consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 141R also
    requires that contingent assets and



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES – (Concluded)

liabilities be recorded at fair value and marked to market
    quarterly until they are settled, with any changes to the fair
    value to be recorded as income or expense in the consolidated
    statement of income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for
    any business combinations that are completed subsequent to
    January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact the provisions of SFAS No. 141R will have on
    its consolidated financial statements and its method of
    accounting for business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160
    requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties
    other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and
    presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a component of
    shareholders’ equity. It also requires the amount of
    consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the consolidated statement of income.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective January 1, 2009, and
    the Company is currently evaluating the impact of this
    pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
    (“SFAS No. 144”) addresses the accounting
    and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
    assets. SFAS No. 144 broadens the presentation of
    discontinued operations to include a component of the Company,
    which comprises operations and cash flows, that can be clearly
    distinguished from the rest of the Company. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, the Company has accounted for the
    business units which were sold in 2007, 2006 and 2005, except as
    noted, as discontinued operations.

During 2007, the Company completed the sale of Avocet, a
    European business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products
    segment. This disposition was completed pursuant to the
    Company’s determination that this business unit was not
    core to the Company’s long-term growth strategy. Total
    gross proceeds from the sale were $41 million; the Company
    recognized a pre-tax net loss on the disposition of Avocet of
    $11 million. During 2007, the Company recorded other net
    gains of $1 million, reflecting the receipt of additional
    purchase price payments related to businesses disposed in 2006
    and 2005.

During 2006, the Company completed the sale of Computerized
    Security Systems (“CSS”), a North American business
    unit in the Other Specialty Products segment. This disposition
    was completed pursuant to the Company’s determination that
    this business unit was not core to the Company’s long-term
    growth strategy. Total gross proceeds from the sale were
    $92 million; the Company recognized a pre-tax net gain on
    the disposition of CSS of $51 million. During 2006, the
    Company recorded additional net expenses of $1 million,
    reflecting the final purchase price payments related to
    businesses disposed in 2005.

During 2005, in separate transactions, the Company completed the
    sale of its Gebhardt Consolidated (Other Specialty Products
    segment) and GMU Group (Cabinets and Related Products segment)
    business units in Europe, as part of the Company’s 2004
    Plan, as well as its Zenith Products (North America) and Aran
    Group (Europe) business units in the Cabinets and Related
    Products segment. Total gross proceeds from the sale of these
    businesses were $319 million; the Company recognized a
    pre-tax net gain (principally related to the sale of Gebhardt
    Consolidated and Zenith Products) on the disposition of these
    businesses of $59 million. During 2005, the Company
    recorded a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations of
    $4 million related to the reversal of certain fee and
    expense accruals that were recorded in 2004. During 2005, the
    Company also recorded income from discontinued operations of
    $3 million related to the reversal of severance accruals
    that were recorded in 2004.

During 2007, the Company completed the sale of two small
    businesses, the results of which were included in continuing
    operations through the dates of sale. These small businesses in
    the Plumbing Products segment had combined net sales and
    operating (loss) of $12 million and $(400,000),
    respectively, in 2007 through the respective dates of sale and
    combined net sales and operating profit of $33 million and
    $3 million, respectively, for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Gross proceeds from the sale of these
    businesses were $10 million; the Company recognized a net
    loss of $8 million included in other, net, in continuing
    operations, related to the sale of these businesses, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

During 2006, the Company completed the sale of several
    relatively small businesses, the results of which were included
    in continuing operations in the Other Specialty Products and
    Plumbing Products segments through the dates of sale. These
    businesses had combined net sales and operating profit of
    $16 million and $5 million, respectively, in 2006
    through the respective dates of sale and combined net sales and
    operating profit of $55 million and $12 million,
    respectively, in 2005. Gross proceeds from the sale of these
    businesses were $72 million; the Company recognized a net
    gain of $1 million in 2006 included in other, net, in
    continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.

C.

ACQUISITIONS

During 2007, the Company acquired several relatively small
    installation service businesses (Installation and Other Services
    segment), as well as Erickson Construction Company and Guy
    Evans, Inc. (Installation and Other Services segment). Erickson
    Construction Company, headquartered in Arizona, provides
    pre-fabricated wall panels and millwork for residential builders
    in Arizona, California and Nevada. Guy Evans, Inc.,
    headquartered in California, is an installer of millwork, doors,
    windows and bath hardware for residential builders in California
    and Nevada. These two acquisitions allow the Company to expand
    the products and services it offers to its installation
    customers, and had combined annual sales in 2006 of
    approximately $200 million. These acquisitions had 2007
    sales and operating profit of $119 million and
    $5 million (including $5 million of additional
    expenses as a result of the acquisition), respectively, since
    the dates of acquisition. The results of these acquisitions are
    included in the consolidated financial statement from the
    respective dates of acquisition.

FINANCIAL
    INVESTMENTS

The Company has maintained investments in available-for-sale
    securities and a number of private equity funds, principally as
    part of its tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the
    utilization of any current and future tax capital losses.
    Financial investments included in other assets were as follows,

Investments in marketable securities are accounted for as
    available-for-sale. Accordingly, the Company records these
    investments at fair value, and unrealized gains or losses (that
    are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect,
    through shareholders’ equity, as a component of other
    comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses and charges for
    other-than-temporary impairments are included in determining net
    income, with related purchase costs based upon specific
    identification.

The Company reviews industry analyst reports, key ratios and
    statistics, market analyses and other factors for each
    investment to determine if an unrealized loss is
    other-than-temporary. Based upon this review, in 2007 and 2005,
    the Company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of
    $6 million and $28 million, respectively, related to
    its investment in Furniture Brands International common stock
    (NYSE: FBN). Based upon this review during 2007, the Company
    also recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of
    $3 million related to its investment in Asahi Tec (Tokyo
    Stock Exchange: 5606.T) common stock.

From time to time, the Company invests its excess cash in
    short-term financial instruments including auction rate
    securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities
    that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or
    35 days. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company
    revised the classification of investments in auction rate
    securities from cash and cash investments to available-for-sale
    securities included in other assets on the consolidated balance
    sheet. The Company has also made corresponding adjustments to
    the consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, to reflect the gross cash
    purchases and sales of these securities in cash flows (for) from
    investing activities. These changes in classification do not
    affect previously reported consolidated statements of income or
    cash flows from operating activities in any prior period. During
    2007, the Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charge of $3 million related to auction rate securities.

On January 11, 2007, the acquisition of Metaldyne
    Corporation (“Metaldyne”) (formerly MascoTech, Inc.)
    by Asahi Tec Corporation (“Asahi Tec”), a Japanese
    automotive supplier, was finalized. The combined fair value of
    the Asahi Tec common and preferred stock, as well as the
    derivative related to the conversion feature on the preferred
    stock, received in exchange for the Company’s investment in
    Metaldyne, was $72 million. The Asahi Tec common and
    preferred stock are restricted from sale for up to
    24 months from the transaction date. The preferred stock
    accrues dividends at an annual rate of 3.75%

pay-in-kind

or 1.75% cash at the discretion of Asahi Tec; the Company has
    elected to record such dividends when cash proceeds are
    received. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized
    a

gain of $14 million, net of transaction fees, included in
    the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, in income from other investments,
    net. Subsequent to the transaction, the Company’s
    investment in Asahi Tec common and preferred stock is accounted
    for as available-for-sale and unrealized gains or losses related
    to the change in fair value of the Asahi Tec common and
    preferred stock at December 31, 2007 have been recognized,
    net of tax, through shareholders’ equity, as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, the unrealized loss of $17 million related to the
    change in fair value of the derivative related to the conversion
    feature on the preferred stock, has been included in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of income, in income from
    other investments, net. At December 31, 2007, the Company
    had a net investment in Asahi Tec of $59 million, including
    $57 million of common and preferred stock and
    $2 million, included in other investments, related to the
    conversion derivative.

In addition, immediately prior to its sale, Metaldyne
    distributed shares of TriMas Corporation (“TriMas”)
    common stock as a dividend to the holders of Metaldyne common
    stock; the Company recognized income of $4 million included
    in the Company’s consolidated statement of income, in
    dividend income from other investments. In May 2007, TriMas made
    an initial public offering; subsequent to the offering, the
    Company’s investment in TriMas is accounted for as
    available-for-sale and unrealized gains or losses related to the
    change in fair value of the investment have been recognized, net
    of tax, through shareholders’ equity, as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s investments in available-for-sale securities
    at December 31, 2007 (including marketable securities,

The Company’s investments in private equity funds and other
    private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for
    potential impairment when impairment indicators are present, or
    when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may
    have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    investment. Impairment indicators the Company considers include
    the following: whether there has been a significant
    deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business
    prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory,
    economic or technological environment; a significant adverse
    change in the general market condition or geographic area in
    which the investment operates; and any bona fide offers to
    purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. Since
    there is no active trading market for these investments, they
    are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their
    nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business
    risk, including financial leverage, than other financial
    investments. Future changes in market conditions, the future
    performance of the underlying investments or new information
    provided by private equity fund managers could affect the
    recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized
    upon liquidation.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had investments in 49
    private equity funds, split between buyout funds and venture
    capital funds, with a carrying value of $173 million. The
    31 buyout funds, which constitute approximately 72 percent
    of the invested value, invest in established businesses, and,
    other than the Heartland fund, no buyout funds have a
    concentration in a particular sector that is undergoing a
    fundamental change, such as the automotive-related market. The
    venture capital funds,



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

E. FINANCIAL
    INVESTMENTS – (Continued)

which constitute approximately 28 percent of the invested
    value, invest in

start-up

or
    smaller established businesses, principally in the areas of
    information technology, bio-technology and healthcare. Of the 49
    funds, there are four funds with a carrying value greater than
    $10 million that aggregate $75 million of carrying
    value. It is not practical for the Company to estimate a fair
    value because the private equity funds have no quoted market
    price and sufficient information is not readily available for
    the Company to utilize a valuation model to determine a fair
    value for each fund.

During 2007, the Company determined that the decline in the
    estimated value of certain private equity fund investments, with
    an aggregate carrying value of $54 million prior to the
    impairment, was other-than-temporary. Accordingly, for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized non-cash,
    pre-tax impairment charges of $10 million.

During 2006, based upon a review of new information from the
    Heartland fund concerning fund investments and the continued
    deterioration of conditions in the automotive supplier and
    transportation products markets served by Metaldyne and TriMas,
    the Company determined that the decline in the estimated value
    of certain of its financial investments was
    other-than-temporary. Accordingly, in 2006, the Company
    recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges aggregating
    $88 million for its investments in Metaldyne
    ($40 million), TriMas ($16 million), the Heartland
    fund ($29 million) and another fund ($3 million) which
    invested in automotive and transportation-related suppliers,
    including Metaldyne and TriMas. Additionally, based upon the
    Company’s review, the Company considered the decline in the
    fair value of certain of its other private equity fund
    investments and other investments to be other-than-temporary
    and, accordingly, recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment
    charges of $13 million and $15 million in 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

The Company’s investments in private equity funds for which
    fair value was determined with unrealized losses, were as
    follows, in millions:

The remaining private equity investments in 2007 and 2006 with
    an aggregate carrying value of $119 million and
    $211 million, respectively, were not evaluated for
    impairment, as there were no indicators of impairment or
    identified events or changes in circumstances that would have a
    significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.

The impairment charges, related to the Company’s financial

    upon then-current estimates for the fair value of certain
    financial investments; such estimates could change in the
    near-term based upon future events and circumstances.

F. DERIVATIVES

During 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap
    agreements for the purpose of effectively converting a portion
    of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. In 2004, the Company
    terminated two interest rate swaps relating to $850 million
    of fixed-rate debt. These swap agreements were accounted for as
    fair value hedges. The gain of approximately $45 million
    from the termination of these swaps is being amortized as a
    reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the
    debt, through July 2012.

In early 2004, the Company entered into two new interest rate
    swap agreements for the purpose of effectively converting a
    portion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The derivative
    contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions, thereby
    minimizing the risk of credit loss. The interest rate swap
    agreements are designated as fair-value hedges, and the interest
    rate differential on the interest rate swaps used to hedge
    existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
    over the term of the agreement. The average variable interest
    rates are based upon LIBOR plus fixed adjustment factors. The
    average effective rate on the interest rate swaps was 6.264% in
    2007. At December 31, 2007, the interest rate swap
    agreements covered a notional amount of $850 million of the
    Company’s fixed-rate debt due July 15, 2012 with an
    interest rate of 5.875%. The hedges are considered
    100 percent effective.

In 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized an increase in interest
    expense of $3 million and $8 million, respectively,
    related to these swap agreements, due to increasing interest
    rates. In 2005, the Company recognized a reduction of interest
    expense of $3 million.

At December 31, 2007, the Company, including certain
    European operations, had entered into foreign currency forward
    contracts with notional amounts of $23 million,
    $7 million and $4 million to



MASCO

manage exposure to currency fluctuations in the European euro,
    the Great Britain pound and the U.S. dollar, respectively.
    At December 31, 2006, the Company, including certain
    European operations, had entered into foreign currency forward
    contracts with notional amounts of $72 million and
    $51 million to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in
    the European euro and the Great Britain pound, respectively.
    Based upon year-end market prices, no asset or liability was
    recorded at December 31, 2007 and 2006, as the forward
    prices were substantially the same as the contract prices. Gains
    (losses) related to these contracts are recorded in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of income in other income
    (expense), net. The counterparties to the Company’s forward
    contracts are major financial institutions. In the unlikely
    event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of the
    foreign currency forward contracts, the Company’s exposure
    is limited to the aggregate foreign currency rate differential
    with such institutions.

The Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill
    in the fourth quarters of 2007 and 2006. This test indicated
    that goodwill recorded for certain of the Company’s
    business units was impaired. The Company recognized the
    non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill of
    $177 million ($177 million, after tax) and
    $331 million ($331 million, after tax) for 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The pre-tax impairment charge recognized in
    2007, in the Other Specialty Products segment, related to the
    Company’s European manufacturer of heating products; in the
    Plumbing Products segment the charge related to a North American
    manufacturer of plumbing-related products. The pre-tax
    impairment charge recognized in 2006 in the Cabinets and Related
    Products segment related to the Company’s European
    manufacturer of ready-to-assemble cabinets. These charges
    reflect the long-term outlook for the business units, including
    declining demand for certain products, as well as decreased
    operating profit margins.

Other indefinite-lived intangible assets were $208 million
    and $246 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, and principally included registered trademarks.

business unit, particularly in the new home construction market.
    The Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge for
    other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $50 million
    ($31 million, after tax) in 2007. In 2006, this test
    indicated that other indefinite-lived intangible assets were not
    impaired.

The carrying value of the Company’s definite-lived
    intangible assets was $115 million at December 31,
    2007 (net of accumulated amortization of $67 million) and
    $60 million at December 31, 2006 (net of accumulated
    amortization of $51 million) and principally included
    customer relationships and non-compete agreements, with a
    weighted average amortization period of 14 years and
    13 years in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, the
    Company increased its definite-lived intangible assets by
    $69 million primarily related to the acquisitions of
    Erickson Construction Company and Guy Evans, Inc. Amortization
    expense related to the definite-lived intangible assets was
    $15 million, $10 million and $22 million in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

At December 31, 2007, amortization expense related to the
    definite-lived intangible assets during each of the next five
    years was as follows: 2008 - $14 million; 2009 –
    $14 million; 2010 – $13 million;
    2011 – $11 million; and 2012 –

DEBT – (Continued)

All of the notes and debentures above are senior indebtedness
    and, other than the 6.625% notes due 2018 and the
    7.75% notes due 2029, are redeemable at the Company’s
    option.

In July 2001, the Company issued $1.9 billion principal
    amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
    2031 (“Old Notes”), resulting in gross proceeds of
    $750 million. The issue price per Note was $394.45 per
    $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented a yield
    to maturity of 3.125% compounded semi-annually. In December
    2004, the Company completed an exchange of the outstanding Old
    Notes for Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes Series B due
    July 2031 (“New Notes” or “Notes”). The
    Company will not pay interest in cash on the Notes prior to
    maturity, except in certain circumstances, including possible
    contingent interest payments that are not expected to be
    material. Holders of the Notes have the option to require that
    the Notes be repurchased by the Company on July 20, 2011
    and every five years thereafter. Upon conversion of the Notes,
    the Company will pay the principal return, equal to the lesser
    of (1) the accreted value of the Notes in only cash, and
    (2) the conversion value, as defined, which will be settled
    in cash or shares of Company common stock, or a combination of
    both, at the option of the Company. The Notes are convertible if
    the average price of Company common stock for the 20 days
    immediately prior to the conversion date exceeds


/


%,
    declining by 1/3% each year thereafter, of the accreted value of
    the Notes divided by the conversion rate of 12.7317 shares
    for each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the Notes. Notes
    also become convertible if the Company’s credit rating is
    reduced to below investment grade, or if certain actions are
    taken by the Company. The Company may at any time redeem all or
    part of the Notes at their then accreted value.

On January 20, 2007, holders of $1.8 billion
    (94 percent) principal amount at maturity of the Notes
    required the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash value
    of $825 million. As a result of this repurchase, a
    $93 million deferred income tax liability was paid in 2007.
    On October 17, 2007, the Company repurchased the remaining
    Old Notes for cash of $85,000. At December 31, 2007, there
    were outstanding $108 million principal amount at maturity
    of Notes, with an accreted value of $52 million, which has
    been included in long-term debt, as the next put option date is
    July 20, 2011.

During 2007, the Company also retired $300 million of
    floating-rate notes due March 9, 2007 and $300 million
    of 4.625% notes due August 15, 2007. On March 14,
    2007, the Company issued $300 million of floating-rate
    notes due 2010; the interest rate is determined based upon the
    three-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points. On March 14,
    2007, the Company also issued $300 million of fixed-rate
    5.85% notes due 2017. These debt issuances provided net
    proceeds of $596 million and were in consideration of the
    March and August 2007 debt maturities.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had a $2.0 billion

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of banks syndicated in
    the United States and internationally, which expires in February
    2011. This agreement allows for borrowings denominated in
    U.S. dollars or European euros with interest payable based
    upon various floating-rate options as selected by the Company.
    There were no amounts outstanding under the

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

In February 2006, the Company amended the terms of the
    $2.0 billion

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement; the amendment primarily affected the
    requirement for the Company to maintain certain levels of net
    worth. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s net worth
    exceeded such requirement by $895 million. The

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, also contains
    limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2007,
    the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to
    availability, of up to $1.9 billion.

At December 31, 2007, the maturities of long-term debt
    during each of the next five years were as follows:
    2008 – $122 million; 2009 –
    $12 million; 2010 – $302 million;
    2011 – $53 million; and 2012 –
    $873 million.

MINORITY
    INTEREST

The Company owned 68 percent and 64 percent of

    The aggregate minority interest, net of dividends, of
    $117 million and $108 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, was recorded in deferred income
    taxes and other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets.

As part of the agreement relating to the Company’s
    acquisition of an additional 37 percent equity ownership of
    Hansgrohe AG in December 2002 (increasing such ownership to
    64 percent), certain minority shareholders of Hansgrohe AG,
    representing four percent of Hansgrohe AG outstanding shares,
    held a put option which required the Company to purchase such
    shares in Hansgrohe AG with Company common stock. In May 2007,
    the put option was exercised and the Company issued two million
    shares of Company common stock with a value of $56 million
    for the additional four percent ownership in Hansgrohe AG.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company elected to change its method of accounting for
    stock-based compensation and implemented the fair value method
    prescribed by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation,” effective January 1, 2003.
    The Company used the prospective method, as defined by
    SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation – Transition and Disclosure –
    an amendment to SFAS No. 123,” for determining
    stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, options granted,
    modified or settled subsequent to January 1, 2003 have been
    accounted for using the fair value method and options granted
    prior to January 1, 2003 were accounted for using the intrinsic
    value method.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R, using the Modified Prospective
    Application (“MPA”) method. The MPA method requires
    the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that
    were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through the remaining
    vesting periods. The MPA method did not require the restatement
    of prior-year information. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut
    method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock
    options as of the date of adoption.

The Company’s 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) replaced the 1991 Long Term Stock
    Incentive Plan (the “1991 Plan”) in May 2005 and
    provides for the issuance of stock-based incentives in various
    forms. At December 31, 2007, outstanding stock-based
    incentives were in the form of long-term stock awards, stock
    options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights.
    Additionally, the Company’s 1997 Non-Employee Directors
    Stock Plan (the “1997 Plan”) provides for the payment
    of part of the compensation to non-employee Directors in Company
    common stock. The 1997 Plan expired in May 2007; subsequently,
    compensation to non-employee Directors in Company common

    awards.

Long-Term Stock
    Awards

Long-term stock awards are granted to key employees and
    non-employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share
    dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of
    repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open
    market.

The Company measures compensation expense for stock awards at
    the market price of the Company’s common stock at the grant
    date. Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is being
    recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the
    stock awards, typically 10 years (except for stock awards
    held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five
    years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes
    retirement-eligible at age 65. For stock awards granted
    prior to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized
    over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically
    10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will
    become, retirement-eligible during the vesting period, the
    expense is being recognized over five years. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company had remaining
    $12 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to
    stock awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 to grantees
    that will or have become retirement-eligible before such awards
    will have been fully expensed; such expense will be recognized
    over the next five years, or immediately upon a grantee’s
    retirement.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there was $175 million
    and $195 million, respectively, of unrecognized
    compensation expense related to unvested stock awards; such
    awards had a weighted average remaining vesting period of seven
    years. There was $185 million of unrecognized compensation
    expense,

which was included as a reduction of shareholders’ equity,
    at December 31, 2005; such expense was reclassified to
    common stock and retained earnings on January 1, 2006 in
    accordance with SFAS No. 123R. At January 1,
    2006, the Company estimated a forfeiture rate for long-term
    stock awards and applied that rate to all previously expensed
    stock awards; such application did not result in a change in the
    expense to be recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting
    change.

The total market value (at the vesting date) of stock award
    shares which vested during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $48 million, $51 million and $60 million,
    respectively.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee
    Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market
    price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date.
    These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over
    five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
    grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant
    date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration
    stock options, except for restoration options resulting from
    options previously granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration
    stock options become exercisable six months from the date of
    grant.

The Company granted 4,862,680 of stock option shares, including
    restoration stock option shares, during 2007 with a grant date
    exercise price range of $22 to $34 per share. During 2007,
    2,032,510 stock option shares were forfeited (including options

Phantom Stock
    Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights
    (“SARs”)

The Company grants phantom stock awards and SARs to certain

non-U.S. employees.

Phantom stock awards are linked to the value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant and are settled
    in cash upon vesting, typically over 10 years. The Company
    accounts for phantom stock awards as liability-based awards; the
    compensation expense is initially measured as the market price
    of the Company’s common stock at the grant date and is
    recognized over the vesting period. The liability is remeasured
    and adjusted at the end of each reporting period until the
    awards are fully-vested and paid to the employees. The Company
    recognized (income) expense of $(2) million and
    $1 million related to the valuation of phantom stock awards
    for 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, the Company
    granted 130,000 shares and 175,000 shares,
    respectively, of phantom stock awards with an aggregate fair
    value of $4 million and $5 million, respectively, and
    paid $4 million of cash in both years to settle phantom
    stock awards.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION – (Concluded)

SARs are linked to the value of the Company’s common stock
    on the date of grant and are settled in cash upon exercise. On
    January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for SARs, in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R, from the intrinsic value method to the
    fair value method. The fair value method requires outstanding
    SARs to be classified as liability-based awards and valued using
    a Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date; such
    fair value is recognized as compensation expense over the
    vesting period, typically five years. The liability is
    remeasured and adjusted at the end of each reporting period
    until the SARs are exercised and payment is made to the
    employees or the SARs expire. As a result of implementing this
    change, during 2006, the Company recognized expense of
    $3 million (net of income tax benefit of $2 million)
    as a cumulative effect of accounting change, net. The Company
    recognized (income) expense of $(5) million and $400,000

EMPLOYEE
    RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors qualified defined-benefit and
    defined-contribution retirement plans for most of its employees.
    In addition to the Company’s qualified defined-benefit
    pension plans, the Company has unfunded non-qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans covering certain employees, which
    provide for benefits in addition to those provided by the
    qualified pension plans. Substantially all salaried employees
    participate in non-contributory defined-contribution retirement
    plans, to which payments are determined annually by the
    Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. Aggregate charges to earnings under the
    Company’s defined-benefit and defined-contribution
    retirement plans were $44 million and $47 million in
    2007, $54 million and $44 million in 2006 and
    $51 million and $42 million in 2005, respectively.

During 2006, the Company implemented SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and

132(R),”

(“SFAS No. 158”). Among other things,
    SFAS No. 158 requires companies to prospectively
    recognize a net liability or asset and to report the funded
    status of their defined-benefit pension and other
    post-retirement benefit plans on their balance sheets, with an
    offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income;
    such recognition did not affect the Company’s consolidated
    statements of income.

The investment objectives of the Company’s qualified
    defined-benefit pension plans are: 1) to earn a return, net
    of fees, greater than or equal to the expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets; 2) to diversify the portfolio among
    various asset classes with the goal of reducing volatility of
    return and reducing principal risk; and 3) to maintain
    liquidity sufficient to meet Plan obligations. Long-term target
    allocations are: equity securities (80%), debt securities (10%)
    and other investments (10%).

Plan assets included 1.4 million shares of Company common
    stock valued at $31 million and $42 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Assumptions

Major assumptions used in accounting for the Company’s
    defined-benefit pension plans were primarily as follows:

4.00%

4.00%

Discount rate for net periodic pension cost

5.50%

5.25%

5.75%

The discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected
    duration of each defined-benefit pension plan’s liabilities
    matched to the December 31, 2007 Citigroup Pension Discount
    Curve. Such rates for the Company’s defined-benefit pension
    plans ranged from 5.00 percent to 6.50 percent, with
    the most significant portion of the liabilities having a
    discount rate for obligations of 6.25 percent or higher at
    December 31, 2007.

The Company determined the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets by reviewing an analysis of expected and historical
    rates of return of various asset classes based upon the current
    and long-term target asset allocation of the plan assets. The
    measurement date used to determine the defined-benefit pension
    expense was primarily December 31.

Other

The Company sponsors certain post-retirement benefit plans that
    provide medical, dental and life insurance coverage for eligible
    retirees and dependents in the United States based upon age and
    length of service. The aggregate present value of the unfunded
    accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
    $9 million at both December 31, 2007 and 2006.

In July 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase for retirement of up to 50 million shares of
    the Company’s common stock in open-market transactions or
    otherwise, replacing a previous Board of Directors authorization
    established in 2006. At December 31, 2007, the Company had
    remaining authorization to repurchase up to 41 million
    shares of its common stock in open-market transactions or
    otherwise. The Company repurchased and retired 31 million
    common shares in 2007, 29 million common shares in 2006 and
    31 million common shares in 2005 for cash aggregating
    $857 million, $854 million and $986 million in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

On the basis of amounts paid (declared), cash dividends per
    common share were $.91 ($.92) in 2007, $.86 ($.88) in 2006 and
    $.78 ($.80) in 2005, respectively. In 2007, the Company
    increased its quarterly cash dividend by five percent to $.23

The Company made dividend distributions of accumulated earnings
    from certain of its foreign subsidiaries from 2004 to 2007. A
    substantial portion of these dividend distributions generated
    significant foreign tax credits that were used to offset the
    majority of the U.S. tax on the dividend distributions and
    resulted in a $45 million and $61 million foreign tax

    estimates have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of
    being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.
    FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on financial
    statement classification and disclosure, and the accounting for
    interest, penalties, interim periods and transition.

Historically, the Company has established reserves for tax
    contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,”
    (“SFAS No. 5”). Under this standard,
    accounting reserves for tax contingencies are established when
    it is probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount
    can be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 48 establishes a
    threshold for recognizing accounting reserves for income tax
    contingencies on uncertain tax positions lower than the
    threshold under SFAS No. 5. Therefore, as a result of
    adopting FIN No. 48, the Company has increased its
    accounting reserves for income tax contingencies (referred to by
    FIN No. 48 as “unrecognized tax benefits”)
    to $91 million as of January 1, 2007, the date of
    adoption. If recognized, $62 million, net of any
    U.S. Federal tax benefit, would affect the Company’s
    effective tax rate. The cumulative effect of adopting
    FIN No. 48 resulted in a reduction to beginning
    retained earnings of $26 million, net of any
    U.S. Federal tax benefit, as of January 1, 2007, and
    the majority of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits
    were reclassified from current to non-current liabilities in
    accordance with the provisions of FIN No. 48.

If recognized, $50 million of the unrecognized tax benefits
    at December 31, 2007, net of any U.S. Federal tax
    benefit, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.

At December 31, 2007, the total unrecognized tax benefits,
    including related interest and penalties, is recorded in
    deferred income taxes and other.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal
    jurisdiction, and various local, state and foreign
    jurisdictions. Beginning with the 2006 consolidated
    U.S. Federal income tax return, the Company has been
    selected by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to
    participate in the Compliance Assurance Program
    (“CAP”). CAP is a real-time audit of the
    U.S. Federal income tax return that allows the IRS, working
    in conjunction with the Company, to determine tax return
    compliance with the U.S. Federal tax law prior to filing
    the return. This program provides the Company with greater
    certainty about its tax liability for a given year within
    months, rather than years, of filing its annual tax return and
    greatly reduces the need for recording U.S. Federal
    unrecognized tax benefits. The IRS has completed their
    examination of the Company’s consolidated U.S. Federal
    tax returns through 2006. With few exceptions, the Company is no
    longer subject to state or foreign income tax examinations on
    filed returns for years before 2000.

The Company does not anticipate that it is reasonably possible
    that any material increase or decrease in its liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits will occur within the next twelve
    months.

OTHER COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted
    claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary
    course of business.

Early in 2003, a suit was brought against the Company and a
    number of its insulation installation companies in the federal
    court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleging that certain practices
    violate provisions of federal and state antitrust laws. The
    plaintiff publicized the lawsuit with a press release and stated
    in that release that the U.S. Department of Justice was
    investigating the business practices of the Company’s
    insulation installation companies. Although the Company was
    unaware of any investigation at that time, the Company was later
    advised that an investigation had been commenced but was
    subsequently closed without any enforcement action recommended.
    Two additional lawsuits were subsequently brought in Virginia
    making similar claims under the antitrust laws. Both of these
    lawsuits have since been dismissed without any payment or
    requirement for any change in business practices. During the
    second half of 2004, the same counsel who commenced the initial
    action in Atlanta filed six additional lawsuits on



MASCO
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

OTHER COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES — (Continued)

behalf of several of Masco’s competitors in the insulation
    installation business. The plaintiffs then dismissed all of
    these lawsuits and, represented by the same counsel, filed
    another action in the same federal court as a putative class
    action against the Company, a number of its insulation
    installation companies and certain of their suppliers. All of
    the Company’s suppliers, who are co-defendants in this
    lawsuit, have settled this case. This suit currently seeks class
    representation for residential insulation contractors (other
    than the defendants and their affiliates) that have directly
    purchased fiberglass insulation suitable for residential
    installation from certain insulation manufacturers. The Company
    is opposing certification of this lawsuit which seeks to proceed
    on a class representation basis. Two additional lawsuits,
    seeking class action status and alleging anticompetitive
    conduct, were filed against the Company and a number of its
    insulation suppliers. One of these lawsuits was filed in a
    Florida state court and has been dismissed by the court with
    prejudice. The other lawsuit was filed in federal court in
    northern California and was recently transferred to federal
    court in Atlanta, Georgia. The Company is vigorously defending
    these remaining cases, including opposing class certification of
    the direct purchasers of insulation who are competitors of the
    Company and who constitute the purported class in one such case,
    and California indirect purchasers of insulation who are either
    consumers or builders and who constitute the purported class in
    the other such case. Based upon the advice of its outside
    counsel, the Company believes that the conduct of the Company
    and its insulation installation companies, which has been the
    subject of the above-described lawsuits, has not violated any
    antitrust laws. There cannot, however, be any assurance that the
    Company will ultimately prevail in the remaining lawsuits or, if
    unsuccessful, that the ultimate liability would not be material.
    The Company is unable at this time to reliably estimate any
    potential liability which might occur from an adverse judgment
    but does not believe that any adverse judgment would have a
    material adverse effect on its businesses or the methods used by
    its insulation installation companies in doing business.

In February 2003, a suit was served upon the Company’s
    subsidiary, Milgard Manufacturing, in the Solano County,
    California Superior Court, alleging design defects in certain of
    Milgard’s aluminum windows. The complaint requests class
    action status for all owners of homes in California in which the
    windows are installed, and seeks replacement costs and other
    damages. Milgard denies that the windows are defective and is
    vigorously defending the case. In August 2006 the trial court
    denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
    Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the California Court of
    Appeals. Based upon the advice of its outside counsel, Milgard
    believes that the trial court ruling should be affirmed by the
    appellate court. The Company believes that it will not incur
    material liability as a result of this lawsuit.

In 2004, the Company learned that European governmental
    authorities were investigating possible anticompetitive business
    practices relating to the plumbing and heating industries in
    Europe. The investigations involve a number of European
    companies, including certain of the Company’s European
    manufacturing divisions and a number of other large businesses.
    As part of its broadened governance activities, the Company,
    with the assistance of its outside counsel, completed a review
    of the competition practices of its European divisions,
    including those in the plumbing and heating industries, and the
    Company is cooperating fully with the European governmental
    authorities. Several private antitrust lawsuits have been filed
    in the United States as putative class actions against, among
    others, the Company and certain of the other companies being
    investigated relating to the defendants’ plumbing
    operations. These appear to be an outgrowth of the
    investigations being conducted by European governmental
    authorities. These lawsuits have been dismissed, however, the
    Company has been notified that a notice of appeal has been filed
    in one of these lawsuits. Based upon the advice of its outside
    counsel, the review of the competition practices of its European
    divisions referred to above and other factors, the Company
    believes that it will not incur material liability as a result
    of the matters that are the subject of these investigations.

Warranty

Certain of the Company’s products and product finishes and
    services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in
    material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to
    the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company
    accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
    products, parts or services to repair or replace products in
    satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Company’s
    estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based
    upon historical experience and expectations of future
    conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any
    changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
    servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted
    accordingly.

Changes in the Company’s warranty liability were as

Acquisition-Related
    Commitments

The Company, as part of certain acquisition agreements, provided
    for the payment of additional consideration in either cash or
    Company common stock, contingent upon whether certain conditions
    are met, including the operating performance of the acquired
    business and the price of the Company’s common stock. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company had additional consideration
    payable in cash of $10 million contingent upon the
    operating performance of the acquired businesses.

Investments

With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity
    funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2007, commitments
    to contribute up to $49 million of additional capital to
    such funds representing the Company’s aggregate capital
    commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to
    date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional
    capital contributions to certain of its private equity funds
    upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. The
    Company has no control over when or if the capital calls will
    occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in
    an increase in the carrying value of the Company’s
    investment in the private equity fund when paid.

Residual Value
    Guarantees

The Company has residual value guarantees resulting from
    operating leases, primarily related to certain of the
    Company’s trucks and other vehicles, in the Installation
    and Other Services segment. The operating leases are generally
    for a minimum term of 24 months and are renewable monthly
    after the initial term. After the end of the initial term, if
    the Company cancels the leases, the Company must pay the lessor
    the difference between the guaranteed residual value and the
    fair market value of the related vehicles. The value of
    lease-related guarantees, including the obligation payable under
    the residual value guarantees, assuming the fair value at lease
    termination is zero, was approximately $88 million at
    December 31, 2007.

OTHER COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES – (Concluded)

For all operating leases that contain residual value guarantee
    provisions (principally related to vehicles), the Company
    calculates the amount due under the guarantees and compares such
    amount to the fair value of the leased assets. If the amount
    payable under the residual value guarantee exceeds the fair
    value at lease termination, the Company would record a liability
    equal to such excess with a corresponding charge to earnings. At
    December 31, 2007, the estimated fair market value exceeded
    the amount payable under the residual value guarantees and no
    liability was recorded.

Other
    Matters

The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and
    customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries
    in which it operates. Such indemnifications include customer
    claims against builders for issues relating to the
    Company’s products and workmanship. In conjunction with
    divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally
    provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to
    various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal
    and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and
    asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material
    amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the
    probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately
    records an estimated liability when probable.

U.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENT

The Company reviews its business portfolio on an ongoing basis
    as part of its corporate strategic planning and has determined
    that several of its European business units are not core to the
    Company’s long-term growth strategy and, accordingly, has
    embarked on a plan of disposition. These business units had
    combined 2007 net sales in excess of $270 million and
    aggregate operating profit of $13 million (excluding an
    impairment charge for goodwill of $108 million), or an
    operating loss of $(95) million, including the impairment
    charge for goodwill. The Company expects proceeds from the
    dispositions to exceed $140 million. The dispositions are
    expected to be completed within the next twelve months.

Controls
    and Procedures.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of
    its disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange
    Act

Rules 13a-15(b)

and

15d-15(b)

as
    of December 31, 2007. Based on this evaluation, the
    Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting.

Management’s report on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) is included in this Report under
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under
    the heading Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting and the report of our independent registered
    public accounting firm is included under the heading
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm” under the same Item.

(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

In connection with the evaluation of the Company’s
    “internal control over financial reporting” that
    occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, which
    is required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by
    paragraph (d) of Exchange

Rules 13a-15

or

15d-15,

(as defined in paragraph (f) of

Rule 13a-15),

management determined that, except as noted below, there was no
    change that materially affected or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect internal control over financial reporting.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company continued a
    phased deployment of a new Enterprise Resource Planning
    (“ERP”) system at Masco Contractor Services, one of
    the Company’s larger business units. The new ERP system is
    a process improvement initiative and is not in response to any
    identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting. The business process
    engineering of this initiative is significant in scale and
    complexity, and will result in significant modifications to
    certain internal controls. The implementation of the new ERP
    system has been designed to enhance the overall system of
    internal control over financial reporting through further
    automation and integration of business processes.
