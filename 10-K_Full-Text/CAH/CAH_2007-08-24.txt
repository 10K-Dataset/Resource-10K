Reportable
    Segments

Fiscal
    2007 Changes to Reportable Segments

The Company changed its reportable segments beginning with the
    first quarter of fiscal 2007. As of June 30, 2006, the
    Company conducted its business within the following four
    reportable segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider
    Services; Medical Products and Services; Pharmaceutical
    Technologies and Services; and Clinical Technologies and
    Services. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the
    Company began reporting its financial information within the
    following five reportable segments: Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical; Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical; Clinical Technologies and
    Services; Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services; and Medical
    Products Manufacturing.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company committed
    to plans to sell the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services
    segment, other than certain generic-focused businesses (the
    segment, excluding the certain generic-focused businesses not
    held for sale, is referred to as the “PTS Business”).
    The Company completed the sale of the PTS Business during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The following is an explanation
    of the fiscal 2007 changes, if any, from the Company’s
    reportable segments as of June 30, 2006:

Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical.

The Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment encompasses the
    businesses previously within the former Pharmaceutical
    Distribution and Provider Services segment, in addition to the
    nuclear pharmacy, third-party logistics support and certain
    generic-focused businesses previously within the former
    Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment and the
    therapeutic plasma distribution capabilities previously within
    the former Medical Products and Services segment.

Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical.

The Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical segment encompasses the
    Company’s medical products distribution business and the
    assembly of sterile and non-sterile procedure kits previously
    within the former Medical Products and Services segment.



Clinical Technologies and Services.

There were
    no changes to the Clinical Technologies and Services segment.

Medical Products Manufacturing.

The Medical
    Products Manufacturing segment encompasses the medical and
    surgical products manufacturing businesses previously within the
    former Medical Products and Services segment.

The revised segment reporting discussed above is reflected
    throughout this report for all periods presented. Historical
    figures are presented in a manner that is consistent with the
    revised segment reporting.

The four segments align within two major sectors: Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services and Clinical and Medical Products.
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services includes the Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Medical segments, and is focused on
    the Company’s foundational logistics and distribution
    capabilities. Clinical and Medical Products includes the
    Clinical Technologies and Services and Medical Products
    Manufacturing segments, and is focused on higher-margin,
    faster-growing medical products businesses.

The following discussion is based on the four reportable
    segments as they were structured as of and for the fiscal year
    ended June 30, 2007.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical

General

.

Through its Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Pharmaceutical segment, the Company
    distributes a broad line of branded and generic pharmaceutical
    products, over-the-counter healthcare products and consumer
    products (collectively, “pharmaceutical products”).
    The Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business
    (formerly referred to as the pharmaceutical distribution
    business) is one of the country’s leading full-service
    wholesale distributors to retail customers (including chain and
    independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets
    and mass merchandisers), hospitals and alternate care providers
    (including mail order pharmacies) located throughout the United
    States. As a full-service wholesale distributor, the
    pharmaceutical supply chain business complements its
    distribution activities by offering a broad range of support
    services to assist its customers in maintaining and helping to
    improve the efficiency and quality of their services. These
    support services include, among others:

•

online procurement, fulfillment and information provided through
    cardinal.com;

•

computerized order entry and order confirmation systems;

•

generic sourcing programs;

•

product movement, inventory and management reports; and

•

consultation on store operations and merchandising.

The Company’s proprietary software systems feature
    customized databases specially designed to help its distribution
    customers order more efficiently, contain costs and monitor
    their purchases.

In addition, this segment’s pharmaceutical supply chain
    business provides services to branded pharmaceutical
    manufacturers through distribution service agreements, including
    distribution services, inventory management services,
    data/reporting services, new product launch support and contract
    and chargeback administration services. This segment also
    operates a pharmaceutical repackaging and distribution program
    for chain and independent drug store customers as well as
    alternate care customers.

This segment operates centralized nuclear pharmacies that
    prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear
    imaging and other procedures in hospitals and clinics. This
    segment also provides third-party logistics support services,
    distributes therapeutic plasma to hospitals, clinics and other
    providers located in the United States and manufactures and
    markets generic pharmaceutical products for sale to hospitals,
    clinics and pharmacies in the United Kingdom. After acquiring
    SpecialtyScripts, LLC (“SpecialtyScripts”) during
    fiscal 2007, this segment operates a specialty pharmacy
    providing prescription fulfillment and clinical care services
    directly to individual patients requiring highly intensive
    therapies.



Through this segment, the Company is a franchisor of
    apothecary-style retail pharmacies through its Medicine Shoppe
    International, Inc. and Medicap Pharmacies Incorporated
    (“Medicap,” and together with Medicine Shoppe
    International, Inc., “Medicine Shoppe”) franchise
    systems in the United States and abroad. Medicine Shoppe also
    owns and operates a limited number of retail pharmacy locations.

Pharmaceutical supply chain business
    model

.

This segment’s pharmaceutical
    supply chain business maintains prime vendor relationships with
    its customers that streamline the purchasing process by reducing
    the number of vendors. Using a prime vendor offers customers
    logistical savings and fosters partnerships between the
    customers and distributor that result in greater efficiency and
    lower costs.

Five primary factors influence the pharmaceutical supply chain
    business’ gross margin for pharmaceutical products:
    customer discounts, manufacturer cash discounts, distribution
    service agreement fees, pharmaceutical price appreciation and
    manufacturer rebates and incentives.

In general, the Company sells pharmaceutical products to its
    customers at a contract price below the manufacturer’s
    published price or another designated price at the time of sale
    (in either case, the “manufacturer’s designated
    price”). The term “customer discounts” refers to
    the difference in dollars between the sales price to customers
    for pharmaceutical products (net of discounts, rebates and
    incentives given to customers) and the manufacturer’s
    designated price for those pharmaceutical products sold in a
    particular period.

The term “manufacturer cash discounts” refers to the
    aggregate amount in dollars of cash incentives the Company
    receives from manufacturers for prompt payment of invoices.
    Manufacturer cash discounts are typically a fixed percentage of
    purchases from the manufacturer.

The term “distribution service agreement fees” refers
    to aggregate fees paid by manufacturers for services provided by
    the Company related to the distribution of the
    manufacturers’ products. The Company’s fee-for-service
    arrangements are reflected in written distribution service
    agreements, and may be a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical price
    appreciation (as described below). In certain instances, the
    Company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the
    maximum fees under the agreement. The fee is typically a fixed
    percentage of either the Company’s purchases from the
    manufacturer or the Company’s sales of the
    manufacturer’s products to its customers.

The term “pharmaceutical price appreciation” refers to
    the impact on gross margin in dollars of pharmaceutical price
    appreciation for products sold during a particular period. The
    impact happens when the Company is able to purchase inventory,
    hold that inventory when a manufacturer increases the price and
    sell that product at the higher price. The Company continues to
    generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers’
    products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without
    receiving distribution service agreement fees. If the frequency
    or rate of pharmaceutical price appreciation slows, the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition
    could be adversely affected.

The term “manufacturer rebates and incentives” refers
    to discounts the Company receives from manufacturers as a result
    of competition among manufacturers, including manufacturers of
    generic pharmaceuticals, in pricing their products. Manufacturer
    rebates and incentives are based on either the Company’s
    purchases from the manufacturer or the Company’s sales of
    the manufacturer’s products to its customers. The Company
    may receive other incentives from manufacturers of generic
    pharmaceuticals for an improved position of the
    manufacturers’ products in the Company’s various
    generic formulary programs. (A formulary program is a generic
    pharmaceutical purchasing program that helps pharmacies maximize
    their cost savings with a broad selection of rebate-eligible and
    lower-priced generic pharmaceuticals.) The Company generally
    earns the highest margins on generic pharmaceuticals during the
    period immediately following the initial launch of a generic
    product in the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical
    selling prices are generally deflationary.

In sum, the Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business
    generates gross margin primarily to the extent that the selling
    price to its customers, net of customer discounts, exceeds in
    the aggregate cost of products sold, net of manufacturer cash
    discounts, distribution service agreement fees, pharmaceutical
    price appreciation and manufacturer rebates and incentives.



With respect to its customers, the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment differentiates
    between bulk and non-bulk customers because bulk customers
    generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of
    revenue than that generated by non-bulk customers. Bulk
    customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse
    operations and customers’ mail order businesses. All other
    customers are classified as non-bulk customers (for example,
    retail stores, pharmacies, hospitals and alternate care sites).
    Bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains
    whose retail stores are classified as non-bulk customers.

See “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” for additional information about the
    pharmaceutical supply chain business model.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Medical

Through its Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical
    segment, the Company distributes a broad range of branded and
    private-label medical and laboratory products, as well as the
    Company’s own line of surgical and respiratory therapy
    products manufactured or sold by the Medical Products
    Manufacturing segment to hospitals, laboratories and ambulatory
    care customers, such as surgery centers and physician offices.
    This segment distributes products both in the United States and
    in Canada.

This segment helps assist customers to reduce costs while
    improving the quality of patient care in a variety of ways,
    including online procurement, fulfillment and information
    provided through cardinal.com and supply-chain management. This
    segment also assembles and distributes sterile and non-sterile
    procedure kits under the
    Presource

®

brand name.

Clinical
    Technologies and Services

Through its Clinical Technologies and Services segment, the
    Company provides products and services to hospitals and other
    healthcare providers. This segment develops, manufactures,
    leases and sells medical technology products, including
    Alaris

®

intravenous medication safety and infusion therapy delivery
    systems, software applications, needle-free disposables and
    related patient monitoring equipment and
    Pyxis

®

dispensing systems that automate the distribution and management
    of medications in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. The
    segment also develops, manufactures, leases and sells dispensing
    systems for medical supplies.

This segment provides pharmacy services, including full-service
    department outsourcing, transitional and turn-key services for
    acute care hospital pharmacies, as well as remote medication
    order entry and review and other services. After acquiring
    MedMined, Inc. (“MedMined”) and Care Fusion
    Incorporated (“Care Fusion”) during fiscal 2007, this
    segment also provides clinical intelligence solutions, including
    products and services that identify and prevent
    hospital-acquired infections and provide barcode-enabled patient
    identification systems used in hospitals.

This segment primarily distributes its products direct to the
    customer, although it also distributes some products through
    medical products distributors, including through the Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Medical segment. This segment
    offers products and services principally in the United States
    and also in Europe, Canada and other regions.

Medical
    Products Manufacturing

Through its Medical Products Manufacturing segment, the Company
    develops and manufactures medical and surgical products for
    distribution to hospitals, physician offices, surgery centers
    and other healthcare providers. These products include infection
    prevention products, such as single-use surgical drapes, gowns
    and apparel, exam and surgical gloves and fluid suction and
    collection systems, and medical specialties products, such as
    respiratory therapy products, surgical instruments and special
    procedure products. After acquiring VIASYS Healthcare Inc.
    (“Viasys”) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007,
    this segment now offers additional products and services
    directed at the critical care ventilation, respiratory
    diagnostics and clinical services, neurological, vascular,
    audio, homecare, orthopedics, sleep diagnostics and other
    medical and surgical products markets. In connection with the
    Viasys acquisition, this segment will be referred to as the
    Medical Products and Technologies segment beginning with the
    first quarter of fiscal 2008.



This segment primarily distributes its products through medical
    products distributors, including through the Company’s
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment. It
    also distributes some products direct to the customer. This
    segment offers products and services principally in the United
    States and also in Europe, Canada and other regions.

For information on comparative segment revenue, profits and
    related financial information, see Note 17 of “Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which is

In addition to Viasys, the Company acquired MedMined, Care
    Fusion and SpecialtyScripts during fiscal 2007. The Company also
    has completed a number of other smaller acquisitions (asset
    purchases, stock purchases and mergers) during the last five
    fiscal years, including acquisitions of Medicap and Snowden
    Pencer Holdings, Inc. during fiscal 2004, Geodax Technology, Inc
    (“Geodax”) during fiscal 2005, and ParMed
    Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“ParMed”) and Denver Biomedical,
    Inc. (“Denver Biomedical”) during fiscal 2006. The
    Company also acquired the wholesale pharmaceutical, health and
    beauty and related drugstore products distribution business of
    The F. Dohmen Co. and certain of its subsidiaries
    (“Dohmen”) and the remaining shares of Source Medical
    Corporation (“Source Medical”), its Canadian joint
    venture, during fiscal 2006.

Divestitures.

Since July 1, 2002, the
    Company has completed several divestiture transactions. These
    transactions include divesting the international and non-core
    domestic businesses of Syncor International Corporation
    (“Syncor”) in several transactions since acquiring
    Syncor in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2006, the Company also
    divested a significant portion of its specialty distribution
    business.

In April 2007, the Company completed the sale of the PTS
    Business to Phoenix Charter LLC (“Phoenix”), an
    affiliate of The Blackstone Group, pursuant to the Purchase and
    Sale Agreement between the Company and Phoenix, dated as of
    January 25, 2007, as amended (the “Purchase
    Agreement”). At the closing of the sale, the Company
    received approximately $3.2 billion in cash from Phoenix,
    which was the purchase price of approximately $3.3 billion
    as adjusted pursuant to certain provisions in the Purchase
    Agreement for the working capital, cash, indebtedness and
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    of the PTS Business.

Prior to being divested, through the PTS Business, the Company
    provided products and services to the healthcare industry
    through pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services in
    nearly all oral and sterile dose forms, including those
    incorporating proprietary drug delivery systems, such as softgel
    capsules, controlled-release forms,
    Zydis

®

fast-dissolving wafers and advanced sterile delivery
    technologies. The PTS Business also provided packaging services,
    pharmaceutical development, analytical science services and
    scientific and regulatory consulting.

During fiscal 2007, the Company also divested its healthcare
    marketing services business and its United Kingdom-based
    Intercare pharmaceutical distribution business.

Certain businesses that were part of the PTS Business and the
    Intercare pharmaceutical distribution business were acquired in
    The Intercare Group, plc (“Intercare”) transaction
    described in the table above.

On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates possible candidates
    for merger or acquisition and considers opportunities to expand
    its operations and services across all reportable segments.
    These acquisitions may involve the use of cash, stock or other
    securities as well as the assumption of indebtedness and
    liabilities. In addition, the Company evaluates its portfolio of
    businesses on an ongoing basis to identify businesses for
    possible divestiture. For additional information concerning
    certain of the transactions described above, see Notes 2, 8
    and 9 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
    and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.”

Customers

The Company’s largest customers, CVS Corporation
    (“CVS”) and Walgreen Co. (“Walgreens”),
    accounted for approximately 21% and 19%, respectively, of the
    Company’s revenue for fiscal 2007. The aggregate of the
    Company’s five largest customers, including CVS and
    Walgreens, accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s
    revenue for fiscal 2007. All of the Company’s business with
    its five largest customers is included in its Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Pharmaceutical segment. The loss of
    one or more of these five customers could adversely affect the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Businesses in each of the Company’s reportable segments
    have agreements with group purchasing organizations
    (“GPOs”) that act as agents that negotiate vendor
    contracts on behalf of their members. Approximately 10% of the
    Company’s revenue for fiscal 2007 was derived from GPO
    members through the contractual arrangements established with
    Novation, LLC (“Novation”) and Premier Purchasing
    Partners, L.P. (“Premier”), the Company’s two
    largest GPO relationships in terms of member revenue. Generally,
    compliance by GPO members with GPO vendor selections is
    voluntary. As such, the Company believes the loss of any of the
    Company’s agreements with a



GPO would not mean the loss of sales to all members of the GPO,
    although the loss of such an agreement could adversely affect
    the Company’s results of operations and financial
    condition. See Note 1 in “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for further information regarding the
    Company’s concentrations of credit risk and major customers.

Suppliers

The Company obtains its products from many different suppliers.
    Products obtained from the Company’s five largest suppliers
    accounted on a combined basis for approximately 20% of the
    Company’s revenue during fiscal 2007. No one
    supplier’s products accounted for more than 5% of the
    Company’s revenue in fiscal 2007. Overall, the Company
    believes that its relationships with its suppliers are good. The
    loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition if
    alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable
    prices.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical

Historically, a significant portion of pharmaceutical supply
    chain’s gross margin was derived from the Company’s
    ability to purchase inventory, hold that inventory when a
    manufacturer increased prices and sell that product at the
    higher price. Beginning in fiscal 2003, branded pharmaceutical
    manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of
    product available in the supply chain and, as a result, began to
    change their sales practices by restricting the volume of
    product available for purchase by wholesalers. In addition,
    manufacturers sought additional services from the Company,
    including providing data concerning product sales and
    distribution patterns. The Company believes that manufacturers
    sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility
    over product demand and movement in the market and to increase
    product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated
    with product being available to, and distributed in, the
    secondary market. These changes significantly reduced the
    pharmaceutical price appreciation earned by the Company.

In response to these developments, the Company established a
    compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers
    that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’
    pricing practices, and is based on the services provided by the
    Company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each
    manufacturer’s products. During fiscal 2005, the Company
    worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to
    define fee-for-service terms that compensate the Company based
    on the services being provided to such manufacturers. This
    transition was completed during fiscal 2006. These new
    arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which
    have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’
    price increases.

The Company’s fee-for-service arrangements are reflected in
    written distribution service agreements. Distribution service
    agreements between the Company and certain branded
    pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a one-year
    term with an automatic renewal feature to a five-year term.
    These agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually
    agreed by the parties, a breach of the agreement occurs that is
    not cured, or a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event
    occurs. Some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the
    agreement without cause within a defined notice period. See the
    “Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Business Model”
    discussion under “Reportable Segments —
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical” above for more information regarding
    distribution service agreement fees.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Medical

The Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical segment purchases products from a wide range of medical
    products suppliers for distribution to its customers. This
    segment, at times, purchases medical and laboratory products
    from suppliers other than the original manufacturer of such
    products. Certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting
    the ability of the segment’s businesses to purchase
    products from anyone other than the manufacturer. If this
    practice becomes more widespread, the ability of the Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Medical segment to purchase
    products from other distributors, as well as its ability to sell
    excess inventories to other distributors, may be impaired. This
    could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations
    and financial condition.



Clinical
    Technologies and Services and Medical Products
    Manufacturing

The Clinical Technologies and Services segment uses purchased
    components in the products it manufactures, including
    custom-designed components and assemblies. The Medical Products
    Manufacturing segment uses a broad range of raw materials,
    compounds and purchased components in the products it
    manufactures, including latex and resins. In certain
    circumstances, the Company’s results of operations and
    financial condition may be adversely affected by raw material or
    component cost increases because the Company may not be able to
    fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset
    the increased cost through productivity improvements. In
    addition, although most of these raw materials or components are
    generally available, certain raw materials or components used by
    the Company’s manufacturing businesses may be available
    only from a limited number of suppliers. Where there are a
    limited number of suppliers, the Company may experience
    shortages in supply, and as a result, the Company’s results
    of operations and financial condition could be adversely
    affected.

With respect to certain products, the Clinical Technologies and
    Services and Medical Products Manufacturing segments contract
    with third-party manufacturers for all or some aspects of their
    product manufacturing. These segments also source certain
    finished products from third-party suppliers.

Competition

The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical

In the Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical segment, the Company’s pharmaceutical supply
    chain business faces competition in the United States from two
    other national wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation and
    AmerisourceBergen Corporation) and a number of smaller regional
    wholesale distributors, self-warehousing chains, direct selling
    manufacturers, specialty distributors and third-party logistics
    companies on the basis of a value proposition that includes
    pricing, breadth of product lines, service offerings and support
    services.

The pharmaceutical supply chain business has narrow profit
    margins and, accordingly, the Company’s earnings depend
    significantly on its ability to:

•

compete effectively on the pricing of pharmaceutical products;

•

distribute a large volume and variety of products efficiently;

•

establish and maintain low cost sourcing arrangements with
    generic pharmaceutical manufacturers;

•

provide quality support services;

•

enter into and maintain satisfactory arrangements with
    pharmaceutical manufacturers so it is compensated for the
    services it provides manufacturers; and

•

effectively manage inventory and other working capital items.

This segment’s nuclear pharmacies compete with nuclear
    pharmacy companies and distributors engaged in the preparation
    and delivery of radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging
    procedures in hospitals and clinics, including numerous national
    and regional networks of radiopharmacies, numerous independent
    radiopharmacies and manufacturers and universities that have
    established their own radiopharmacies. This segment’s
    nuclear pharmacies compete based upon a variety of factors,
    including price, quality, customer service, proprietary
    technologies or capabilities and responsiveness.

With respect to pharmacy franchising operations, a few smaller
    franchisors compete with Medicine Shoppe in the franchising of
    pharmacies, with competition being based primarily upon
    financial assistance offered to qualified franchisees,
    aggregation of purchase volume, operational support and
    assistance, benefits offered to both the pharmacist and the
    customer, access to third-party programs, brand awareness and
    marketing support and pricing. Medicine Shoppe also needs to be
    competitive with a pharmacist’s ongoing options to operate
    an independent pharmacy or work for a chain pharmacy.



Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Medical

The Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical segment faces competition both in the United States and
    in Canada. Competitive factors within this segment include
    price, order-filling accuracy (both invoicing and product
    selection), breadth of product offerings, product availability
    and service offerings. This segment competes across several
    customer classes with many different distributors, including
    Owens & Minor, Inc., Fisher Scientific International,
    Inc., Physician Sales & Service, Inc., Henry Schein,
    Inc. and Medline Industries, Inc., among others. This segment
    also competes with a number of smaller regional medical products
    distributors and also with third-party logistics companies.

Clinical
    Technologies and Services

The Company’s Clinical Technologies and Services segment
    faces competition in both its domestic and international
    markets. Its infusion products compete based upon quality,
    technological innovation, price, patents and other intellectual
    property and the value proposition of helping improve patient
    outcomes while reducing overall costs associated with medication
    safety. Competitors with respect to infusion products include
    both domestic and foreign companies, including Hospira, Inc., B.
    Braun Medical, Inc., Baxter International, Inc. and Fresenius AG.

This segment’s dispensing products (including supply
    dispensing products) compete based upon quality, relationships
    with customers, price, customer service and support
    capabilities, patents and other intellectual property and its
    ability to interface with customer information systems. Actual
    and potential competitors with respect to dispensing products
    include both existing domestic and foreign companies, including
    McKesson Corporation and Omnicell, Inc., as well as emerging
    companies that supply products for specialized markets and other
    outside service providers.

This segment’s pharmacy services compete based on range and
    quality of services, price, effective use of information
    systems, development and implementation of clinical programs and
    the established base of existing operations. Competitors include
    both national and regional hospital pharmacy management and
    remote order entry firms, including McKesson Corporation, as
    well as self-managed hospitals and hospital systems.

Medical
    Products Manufacturing

The Company’s Medical Products Manufacturing segment faces
    competition in both its domestic and international markets.
    Competitive factors include product innovation, performance,
    quality, price and brand recognition. This segment competes
    against several medical product manufacturers, including
    Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Covidien Ltd. (formerly Tyco
    Healthcare), Teleflex Incorporated, Medline Industries, Inc.,
    Ansell Limited, 3M Company, Getinge AB, Dräger Medical
    AG & Co. KG and Respironics, Inc., among others.

Employees

As of June 30, 2007, the Company had approximately
    28,800 employees in the United States and approximately
    14,700 employees outside of the United States. Overall, the
    Company considers its employee relations to be good.

Intellectual
    Property

The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent,
    copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other
    contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its
    products, services and intangible assets. These proprietary
    rights are important to the Company’s ongoing operations.
    The Company operates under licenses for certain proprietary
    technology and in certain instances licenses its technology to
    third parties.

The Company has applied in the United States and certain foreign
    countries for registration of a number of trademarks and service
    marks, some of which have been registered, and also holds common
    law rights in various trademarks and service marks. It is
    possible that in some cases the Company may be unable to obtain
    the registrations for trademarks and service marks for which it
    has applied.



Through its Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical segment, the Company holds patents relating to
    certain aspects of its nuclear pharmacy products. Through its
    Clinical Technologies and Services segment, the Company holds
    patents relating to certain aspects of its automated
    pharmaceutical dispensing systems, automated medication
    management systems, medical devices, infusion therapy systems,
    infusion administration sets, drug delivery systems and
    infection surveillance and reporting systems. Through its
    Medical Products Manufacturing segment, the Company holds
    patents relating to certain aspects of its medical and surgical
    products and devices, including surgical and exam gloves,
    drapes, gowns, respiratory therapy devices, patient prep
    products and surgical instruments. The Company also holds
    patents relating to certain processes and products across all
    segments. The Company has a number of pending patent
    applications in the United States and certain foreign countries,
    and intends to pursue additional patents as appropriate. The
    Company has enforced and will continue to enforce its
    intellectual property rights in the United States and worldwide.

The Company does not consider any particular patent, trademark,
    license, franchise or concession to be material to its overall
    business.

Regulatory
    Matters

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may be required to
    register for permits

and/or

licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards
    of, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (the
    “DEA”), the Food and Drug Administration (the
    “FDA”), the United States Nuclear Regulatory
    Commission (the “NRC”), the Department of Health and
    Human Services (“DHHS”), and various state boards of
    pharmacy, state health departments

and/or

comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies, and
    certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations
    and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.
    These subsidiaries include those that:

•

distribute

and/or

engage in logistics services for prescription pharmaceuticals
    (including certain controlled substances)

and/or

medical devices;

•

manage or own pharmacy operations;

•

engage in or operate retail, specialty or nuclear pharmacies;

•

purchase pharmaceuticals;

•

develop, manufacture or package pharmaceutical products and
    medical devices;

•

market pharmaceutical and medical device products; and

•

provide consulting services and solutions that assist healthcare
    institutions and pharmacies in their operations as well as
    pharmaceutical manufacturers with regard to regulatory
    submissions and filings made to healthcare agencies such as the
    FDA.

In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are
    subject to requirements of the Controlled Substances Act and the
    Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and similar state laws,
    which regulate the marketing, purchase, storage and distribution
    of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples under
    prescribed minimum standards. Certain of the Company’s
    subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices are subject to the
    Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Medical
    Device Amendments of 1976, the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990,
    as amended in 1992, the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, the
    Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, and
    comparable foreign regulations. In addition, certain of the
    Company’s subsidiaries are subject to the Needlestick
    Safety and Prevention Act.

Laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of products
    also exist in most other countries where the Company’s
    subsidiaries conduct business. In addition, the international
    manufacturing operations within the Company’s Clinical
    Technologies and Services and Medical Products Manufacturing
    segments are subject to local certification requirements,
    including compliance with domestic

and/or

foreign good manufacturing practices and quality system
    regulations established by the FDA

and/or

applicable foreign regulatory authorities.

The FDA in the United States, as well as other governmental
    agencies inside and outside of the United States, administer
    requirements covering the design, testing, safety,
    effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and



advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of
    certain of the Company’s manufactured products. The Company
    must obtain specific approval or clearance from the FDA and

non-U.S. regulatory

authorities before it can market and sell many of its products
    in a particular country. Even after the Company obtains
    regulatory approval or clearance to market a product, the
    product and the Company’s manufacturing processes are
    subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory
    authorities.

The Company is subject to possible administrative and legal
    actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for violations
    of laws and regulations including, without limitation, those
    laws and regulations described above. Such actions may include
    product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt
    manufacture and distribution, and other civil and criminal
    sanctions. From time to time, the Company has instituted
    compliance actions, such as removing products from the market
    that were found not to meet applicable requirements. See
    Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for a discussion of the Alaris SE Pump recall.

To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable
    requirements, the Company regularly reviews its quality systems
    to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for
    improvement. The Company also performs assessments of its
    suppliers of raw materials, components and finished goods. In
    addition, the Company conducts quality management reviews
    designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the
    quality of products and services. From time to time, the Company
    may determine that products manufactured or marketed by the
    Company do not meet company specifications, published standards,
    such as those issued by the International Standards
    Organization, or regulatory requirements. When a quality issue
    is identified to the Company, it will investigate and take
    appropriate corrective action, such as withdrawal of the product
    from the market, correction of the product at the customer
    location, notice to the customer of revised labeling,

and/or

other
    actions.

The Company’s franchising operations, through Medicine
    Shoppe, are subject to Federal Trade Commission regulations, and
    rules and regulations adopted by certain states, which require
    franchisors to make certain disclosures to prospective
    franchisees prior to the sale of franchises. In addition, many
    states have adopted laws which regulate the
    franchisor-franchisee relationship. The most common provisions
    of such laws establish restrictions on the ability of
    franchisors to terminate or refuse to renew franchise
    agreements. From time to time, similar legislation has been
    proposed or is pending in additional states.

The Company operates nuclear pharmacies and related businesses,
    such as cyclotron facilities used to produce positron emission
    tomography (“PET”) products used in medical imaging.
    This business operates in a regulated industry which requires
    licenses or permits from the NRC, the radiologic health agency

and/or

department of health of each state in which it operates and the
    applicable state board of pharmacy. In addition, the FDA is also
    involved in the regulation of cyclotron facilities where PET
    products are produced.

Services and products provided by certain of the Company’s
    businesses involve access to healthcare information gathered and
    assessed for the benefit of healthcare clients. Greater scrutiny
    on a federal and state level is being placed on how patient
    identifiable healthcare information should be handled and in
    identifying the appropriate parties and the means to do so.
    Changes in regulations

and/or

legislation such as the Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its
    accompanying federal regulations, such as those pertaining to
    privacy and security, may affect how some of these information
    services or products are provided. In addition, certain of the
    Company’s operations, depending upon their location, may be
    subject to additional state or foreign regulations affecting
    personal data protection and how information services or
    products are provided. Failure to comply with HIPAA and other
    such laws may subject the Company

and/or

its
    subsidiaries to civil

and/or

criminal penalties, which could be significant.

The Company is also subject to various federal, state and local
    laws, regulations and recommendations, both in the United States
    and abroad, relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and
    manufacturing practices and the use, transportation and disposal
    of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition,
    U.S. and international import and export laws and
    regulations require the Company to abide by certain standards
    relating to the importation and exportation of finished goods,
    raw materials and supplies and the handling of information. The
    Company is also subject to certain laws and regulations
    concerning the conduct of its foreign operations, including the
    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws
    and laws pertaining to the accuracy of the Company’s
    internal books and records. Certain of the Company’s
    subsidiaries also maintain contracts with the federal government
    and are subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to
    government contractors.



The Company’s operations are affected by federal, state

and/or

local
    environmental laws. The Company has compliance programs in place
    designed to meet applicable environmental compliance
    requirements. The Company has made, and intends to continue to
    make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable
    environmental laws. As a result of acquisitions, the Company is
    participating in cleaning up environmental contamination from
    past industrial activity at certain sites.

There have been increasing efforts by various levels of
    government, including state departments of health, state boards
    of pharmacy and comparable agencies, to regulate the
    pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the
    introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled
    pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. Several states
    have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations,
    including pedigree tracking requirements, that are intended to
    protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system.
    Florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and
    California has enacted a law requiring chain of custody
    technology using electronic pedigrees. Regulations requiring
    pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances
    adopted under the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act became
    effective on December 1, 2006. These federal regulations
    have been challenged in a legal proceeding brought by secondary
    distributors. A preliminary injunction was issued by the federal
    District Court for the Eastern District of New York that
    temporarily enjoined implementation of these federal
    regulations. These laws and regulations could increase the
    overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the
    Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business, and could
    adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and
    financial condition. The Company continues to work with its
    suppliers in an ongoing effort to minimize counterfeit products
    in the supply chain.

On December 26, 2006, the Company entered into a civil
    settlement to resolve a civil investigation by the New York
    Attorney General’s Office focusing on trading in the
    secondary market for pharmaceuticals. The Company has
    voluntarily undertaken and implemented a number of business
    reforms regarding certain matters examined as part of the
    investigation and also has implemented additional business
    reforms within its pharmaceutical supply chain business as
    required by the settlement. The Company has substantially
    enhanced its employee training programs and adopted policies and
    procedures designed to prevent the improper diversion of
    pharmaceutical products. It also now requires wholesale
    customers to certify their compliance with the Company’s
    wholesaler safe product practices. In connection with the
    settlement, the Company agreed to conduct annual

agreed-upon

procedures testing in 2007, 2008 and 2009 to assess its
    compliance with the procedures outlined in the settlement.

The Company is subject to extensive local, state and federal
    laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The
    federal government continues to scrutinize potentially
    fraudulent practices in the healthcare industry in an attempt to
    minimize the cost that such practices have on Medicare, Medicaid
    and other government healthcare programs. In addition, state
    attorney general offices have investigated, and may in the
    future investigate, the Company’s operations for compliance
    with such laws and regulations. For example, certain state
    attorney general offices are alleging that the Company has
    caused Medicaid reimbursements to be paid for repackaged
    pharmaceuticals without paying the required Medicaid rebate and
    that certain of the Company’s repackaging business
    practices violate the Medicaid rebate statute. See Note 12
    of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    discussion of the state attorneys general investigation related
    to repackaged pharmaceuticals. Many of these laws and
    regulations are complex and broadly written and could be
    interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or
    judicial authority in a manner that could require the Company to
    make changes in its operations. If the Company fails to comply
    with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil
    damages and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses
    or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other
    federal and state healthcare programs.

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA”) includes
    provisions that change the prescription drug reimbursement
    formula for generic pharmaceuticals under Medicaid to a
    reimbursement formula based on the lowest average
    manufacturers’ price in an effort to reduce costs for that
    program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
    (“CMS”) released a final rule implementing these
    provisions on July 6, 2007. Under the final rule, the major
    changes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals are expected to
    become effective in the second and third quarters of fiscal
    2008. The final rule also requires for the first time public
    reporting by the manufacturers of the average
    manufacturers’ price (as defined by CMS) for branded and
    generic pharmaceuticals. The Company is continuing to work with
    its customers and the regulatory agencies in this process. The
    Company is currently developing plans to mitigate the potential
    impact of these legislative changes. If the Company fails to
    successfully



develop and implement such plans, this change in reimbursement
    formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions
    of the DRA could adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations and financial condition.

The costs associated with complying with the various applicable
    federal regulations, as well as state and foreign regulations,
    could be significant and the failure to comply with all such
    legal requirements could have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Inventories

The Company’s distribution businesses are generally not
    required by its customers to maintain particular inventory
    levels other than as may be required to meet service level
    requirements. Certain supply contracts with U.S. Government
    entities require the Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical, Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical and Clinical Technologies and
    Services segments to maintain sufficient inventory to meet
    emergency demands. The Company does not believe that the
    requirements contained in these U.S. Government supply
    contracts materially impact inventory levels.

The Company’s customer return policies generally require
    that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking
    fees, and only allow customers to return products that can be
    added back to inventory and resold at full value, or that can be
    returned to vendors for credit.

The Company’s practice is to offer market payment terms to
    its customers.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

The risks described below could materially and adversely affect
    the Company’s results of operations, financial condition,
    liquidity and cash flows. These risks are not the only risks
    that the Company faces. The Company’s business operations
    could also be affected by additional factors that are not
    presently known to it or that the Company currently considers to
    be immaterial to its operations.

Competitive
    pressures could adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations and financial condition.

The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive. For
    example, the Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business
    competes with two national wholesale distributors, McKesson
    Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and a number of
    smaller regional wholesale distributors, self-warehousing
    chains, direct selling manufacturers, specialty distributors and
    third-party logistics companies. In addition, certain of the
    Company’s customers have consolidated and may continue to
    do so in the future. Competitive pressures could adversely
    affect the Company’s results of operations and financial
    condition.

Substantial
    defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the
    Company’s products by large customers could have an adverse
    effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial
    condition.

In recent years, a significant portion of the Company’s
    revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large
    customers. The Company’s largest customers, CVS and
    Walgreens, accounted for approximately 21% and 19%,
    respectively, of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2007. The
    aggregate of the Company’s five largest customers,
    including CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 50% of
    the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2007. In addition, CVS and
    Walgreens accounted for 20% and 27%, respectively, of the
    Company’s gross trade receivable balance at June 30,
    2007. As a result, the Company’s sales and credit
    concentration is significant. Any



defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from
    these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on
    the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, certain of the Company’s businesses have
    entered into agreements with GPOs. Approximately 10% of the
    Company’s revenue for fiscal 2007 was derived from GPO
    members through the contractual arrangements established with
    Novation and Premier. Generally, compliance by GPO members with
    GPO vendor selections is voluntary. Still, the loss of an
    agreement with a GPO could have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition
    because the Company could lose customers or have to reduce
    prices as a result.

Changes
    in the United States healthcare environment could adversely
    affect the Company’s results of operations and financial
    condition.

The healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and
    the Company expects the industry to continue to change
    significantly in the future. Some of these changes, such as
    adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services,
    legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient
    information, or the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for
    pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits,
    may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount
    of the Company’s products and services they purchase or the
    price they are willing to pay for the Company’s products
    and services. The Company expects continued government and
    private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes
    in the healthcare industry’s or any suppliers’
    pricing, reimbursement, selling, inventory, distribution or
    supply policies or practices, or changes in the Company’s
    customer mix, could also significantly reduce the Company’s
    revenue, increase the Company’s costs or otherwise
    significantly impact its results of operations.

Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of
    generic pharmaceuticals will increase over the next few years as
    a result of the expiration of certain pharmaceutical patents. A
    decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of or
    reimbursements for generic pharmaceuticals could adversely
    affect the Company’s results of operations and financial
    condition.

There have been increasing efforts by various levels of
    government, including state departments of health, state boards
    of pharmacy and comparable agencies, to regulate the
    pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the
    introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled
    pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. Several states
    have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations,
    including pedigree tracking requirements, that are intended to
    protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system.
    Florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and
    California has enacted a law requiring chain of custody
    technology using electronic pedigrees. Regulations requiring
    pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances
    adopted under the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act became
    effective on December 1, 2006. These federal regulations
    have been challenged in a case brought by secondary
    distributors. A preliminary injunction was issued by the federal
    District Court for the Eastern District of New York that
    temporarily enjoined implementation of these federal
    regulations. These laws and regulations could increase the
    overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the
    Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business, and could
    adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA”) includes
    provisions that change the prescription drug reimbursement
    formula for generic pharmaceuticals under Medicaid to a
    reimbursement formula based on the lowest average
    manufacturers’ price in an effort to reduce costs for that
    program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
    (“CMS”) released a final rule implementing these
    provisions on July 6, 2007. Under the final rule, the major
    changes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals are expected to
    become effective in the second and third quarters of fiscal
    2008. The final rule also requires for the first time public
    reporting by the manufacturers of the average
    manufacturers’ price (as defined by CMS) for branded and
    generic pharmaceuticals. The Company is continuing to work with
    its customers and the regulatory agencies in this process. The
    Company is currently developing plans to mitigate the potential
    impact of these legislative changes. If the Company fails to
    successfully develop and implement such plans, this change in
    reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and
    other provisions of the DRA could adversely affect the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition.



The Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical segment, at times, purchases medical/surgical and
    laboratory products from vendors other than the original
    manufacturer of such products. Certain manufacturers have
    adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment’s
    businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the
    manufacturer. If this practice becomes more widespread, the
    ability of the Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical segment to purchase products from other distributors, as
    well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other
    distributors, may be impaired. This could adversely affect the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The
    Company’s pharmaceutical supply chain business is subject
    to appreciation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation
    in generic pharmaceutical prices, which subjects the Company to
    risks and uncertainties.

Some distribution service agreements entered into by the Company
    with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price
    appreciation-based component to them in addition to a service
    fee component. The Company also continues to generate gross
    margin from the sale of some manufacturers’ products from
    pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution
    service agreement fees. If the frequency or rate of branded
    pharmaceutical price appreciation slows, the Company’s
    results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
    affected.

In addition, the pharmaceutical supply chain business
    distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are generally subject
    to price deflation. If the frequency or rate of generic
    pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, the Company’s
    results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
    affected.

The
    Company is subject to legal proceedings that could adversely
    affect the Company’s results of operations and financial
    condition.

The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings, which,
    if decided adversely to the Company or settled by the Company on
    unfavorable terms, could have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
    The Company discusses these legal proceedings in greater detail
    below in Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.”

In addition, the Company’s products or services expose it
    to product and professional liability risks. The availability of
    product liability insurance for large companies in the
    pharmaceutical and medical device industry is generally more
    limited than insurance available to smaller companies and
    companies in other industries. Insurance carriers providing
    product liability insurance to large pharmaceutical and medical
    device companies generally limit the amount of available policy
    limits, require larger self-insured retentions and include
    exclusions for certain products. There can be no assurance that
    a successful product or professional liability claim would be
    adequately covered by the Company’s applicable insurance
    policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and, as
    such, these claims could adversely affect the Company’s
    results of operations and financial condition.

Failure
    to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could
    adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated. The Company is
    subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and
    transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating
    and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards
    of pharmacy, state health departments, the NRC, DHHS, the
    European Union member states and other comparable agencies.
    Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may be required to
    register for permits

and/or

licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards
    of, the DEA, the FDA, the NRC, DHHS and various state boards of
    pharmacy, state health departments

and/or

comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and
    certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations
    and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.

Although the Company believes that it is in compliance, in all
    material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there
    can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would
    not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of
    the Company’s operations with applicable laws and
    regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
    Company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits,
    licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without
    significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals
    needed for the operation of the Company’s businesses. Any
    noncompliance by the Company with applicable laws and
    regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain
    necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on
    the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.



The manufacture, distribution and marketing of certain of the
    Company’s products are subject to extensive ongoing
    regulation by the FDA. Failure to comply with the requirements
    of the FDA could result in warning letters, product recalls or
    seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture
    and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions,
    refusal of the government to grant approvals, restrictions on
    operations or withdrawal of existing approvals. See Note 12
    of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    discussion of the Alaris SE Pump recall. Any of these actions
    could cause a loss of customer confidence in the Company and its
    products which could adversely affect the Company’s sales.
    In addition, third parties may file claims against the Company
    in connection these issues.

The Company is also subject to extensive local, state and
    federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and
    abuse. The federal government continues to scrutinize
    potentially fraudulent practices in the healthcare industry in
    an attempt to minimize the cost that such practices have on
    Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. In
    addition, state attorney general offices have investigated, and
    may in the future investigate, the Company’s operations for
    compliance with such laws and regulations. For example, certain
    state attorney general offices are alleging that the Company has
    caused Medicaid reimbursements to be paid for repackaged
    pharmaceuticals without paying the required Medicaid rebate and
    that certain of the Company’s repackaging business
    practices violate the Medicaid rebate statute. See Note 12
    of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    discussion of the state attorneys general investigation related
    to repackaged pharmaceuticals. Many of these laws and
    regulations are complex and broadly written and could be
    interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or
    judicial authority in a manner that could require the Company to
    make changes in its operations. If the Company fails to comply
    with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil
    damages and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses
    or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other
    federal and state healthcare programs.

Circumstances
    associated with the Company’s acquisition strategy could
    adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

An important element of the Company’s growth strategy
    historically has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other
    businesses which expand or complement the Company’s
    existing businesses. Acquisitions involve risks, including the
    risk that the Company overpays for a business or is unable to
    obtain the synergies and other expected benefits from acquiring
    a business in a timely manner, or at all. Integrating acquired
    businesses also involves a number of special risks, including
    the following:

•

the possibility that management may be distracted from regular
    business concerns by the need to integrate operations;

•

unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems
    and realizing potential revenue synergies and cost savings;

•

problems assimilating and retaining the management or employees
    of the acquired company or the Company’s employees
    following an acquisition;

•

accounting issues that could arise in connection with, or as a
    result of, the acquisition of the acquired company, including
    issues related to internal control over financial reporting;

•

regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired
    company or business;

•

challenges in retaining the customers of the combined
    businesses; and

•

potential adverse short-term effects on results of operations
    through increased costs or otherwise.

If the Company is unable to successfully complete and integrate
    strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, its results of
    operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Consolidating
    the headquarters of the Healthcare Supply Chain Services sector
    could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations
    and financial condition.

On April 30, 2007, the Company announced that it was moving
    the headquarters of its Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical segment and certain corporate
    functions from Waukegan, Illinois to the Company’s
    corporate headquarters in Dublin, Ohio. This consolidation is
    expected to take place over the next two years. The
    consolidation could result in customer service and other
    business disruptions in the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical segment and challenges in retaining
    this segment’s key employees. If the Company is unable to



successfully complete the Healthcare Supply Chain Services
    headquarters consolidation, its results of operations and
    financial condition could be adversely affected.

The
    Company’s future results of operations are subject to
    fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased
    components, compounds, raw materials and energy.

The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw
    materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their
    derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its
    products through its Clinical Technologies and Services and
    Medical Products Manufacturing segments. It is possible that any
    of the Company’s supplier relationships could be
    interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be
    terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the
    Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have an
    adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company
    has processes to minimize volatility in component and material
    pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able
    to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price
    fluctuations or shortages will not have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations.

Proprietary
    technology protections may not be adequate.

The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent,
    copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other
    contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a
    number of its products, services and intangible assets. These
    proprietary rights are important to the Company’s ongoing
    operations. There can be no assurance that these protections
    will provide meaningful protection against competitive products
    or services or otherwise be commercially valuable or that the
    Company will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual
    property or enforcing its intellectual property rights against
    unauthorized users. There can be no assurance that the
    Company’s competitors will not independently develop
    technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to
    the Company’s technology.

The
    products that the Company manufactures or distributes may be
    found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third
    parties.

From time to time, third parties have asserted infringement
    claims against the Company and there can be no assurance that
    third parties will not assert infringement claims against the
    Company in the future. While the Company believes that the
    products that it currently manufactures using its proprietary
    technology do not infringe upon proprietary rights of other
    parties or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to
    any assertions to the contrary, there can be no assurance that
    the Company would not be found to infringe on the proprietary
    rights of others.

The Company may be subject to litigation over infringement
    claims regarding the products it manufactures or distributes.
    This type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and
    could generate significant expenses, damage payments or
    restrictions or prohibitions on the Company’s use of its
    technology, which could adversely affect the Company’s
    results of operations. In addition, if the Company is found to
    be infringing on proprietary rights of others, the Company may
    be required to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a
    license or cease making, using

and/or

selling the infringing products.

Generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the
    validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical
    products. During the pendency of these legal challenges, a
    generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a
    generic version of the branded product prior to the final
    resolution to its legal challenge over the branded
    product’s patent. The Company may distribute that generic
    product purchased from the generics manufacturer. As a result,
    the brand-name company may assert infringement claims against
    the Company. While the Company generally obtains indemnity
    rights from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing
    their products, there can be no assurances that these indemnity
    rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect the Company.

Risks
    generally associated with the Company’s information systems
    and implementation of a new accounting software system could
    adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting.

The Company relies on information systems in its business to
    obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:

•

facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of
    inventory items from numerous distribution centers;



•

receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;

•

manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of
    customers;

•

process payments to suppliers; and

•

facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products.

The Company’s results of operations could be adversely
    affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen
    events or fail for any extended period of time, including due to
    the actions of third parties.

In addition, in July 2007, the Company began implementing a new
    accounting software system and will transition selected
    financial processes to the new system throughout fiscal 2008 and
    2009. If the Company does not effectively implement this system
    or if the system does not operate as intended, it could
    adversely affect the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Tax
    legislation initiatives or challenges to the Company’s tax
    positions could adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations and financial condition.

The Company is a large multinational corporation with operations
    in the United States and international jurisdictions. As such,
    the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the
    United States federal, state and local governments and of many
    international jurisdictions. From time to time, various
    legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely
    affect the Company’s tax positions. There can be no
    assurance that the Company’s effective tax rate or tax
    payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In
    addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as
    international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex
    and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no
    assurance that the Company’s tax positions will not be
    challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would
    be successful in any such challenge.

The
    Company’s global operations are subject to a number of
    economic, political and regulatory risks.

The Company conducts its operations in various regions of the
    world outside of the United States, including North America,
    South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Global economic and
    regulatory developments affect businesses such as the
    Company’s in many ways. Operations are subject to the
    effects of global competition. Particular local jurisdiction
    risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws. The
    Company’s global operations are affected by local economic
    environments, including inflation, recession and currency
    volatility. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive,
    can interfere with the Company’s supply chain and customers
    and all of its activities in a particular location. While some
    of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other
    financial instruments and some of these other risks may be
    insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and
    not always successful

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should
    be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
    statements and related notes included in this

Form 10-K.

Unless otherwise indicated, throughout this Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations, discussion of matters in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements refers to continuing
    operations. The Company’s discussion of results of
    operations is presented in four parts: Company Overview,
    Consolidated Results of Operations, Segment Results of
    Operations and Other Matters.

Company
    Overview

Strategic
    Overview

Cardinal Health is a leading provider of products and services
    that improve the safety and productivity of healthcare. The
    Company is one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals
    and medical supplies focusing on making supply chains more
    efficient. The Company distributes approximately one-third of
    all pharmaceuticals prescribed in the United States and also
    distributes or manufactures products that are used in
    approximately 50% of all surgeries in the United States. The
    Company develops market-leading technologies, including Alaris
    infusion pumps, Pyxis automated dispensing systems,
    MedMined

tm

electronic infection surveillance, Viasys respiratory care
    products and the Care
    Fusion

tm

patient identification system. The Company’s Pyxis and
    Alaris systems distribute approximately 8.5 million doses
    of medication every day. Customers include hospitals and
    clinics, some of the largest drug store chains in the United
    States and many other healthcare providers and retail outlets.
    The Company believes that its depth and breadth of products is
    unique in the industry and gives it a competitive advantage.



Cardinal Health’s mission is to make the practice and
    delivery of healthcare safer and more productive for healthcare
    providers. Over the last fiscal year the Company made three
    major changes to better pursue its mission:

•

the Company reorganized its businesses and reportable segments;

•

the Company divested the PTS Business to focus on the healthcare
    provider in both the retail and hospital settings; and

•

the Company made strategic acquisitions that broaden and enhance
    product offerings.

First, the Company reorganized its reportable segments effective
    the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and began reporting its
    financial information within the following five reportable
    segments: Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical; Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical; Clinical Technologies and Services; Pharmaceutical
    Technologies and Services; and Medical Products Manufacturing.
    This change in segment reporting resulted from a realignment of
    the individual businesses to better correlate the operations of
    the Company with the needs of its customers. This change had no
    effect on the Company’s reported net earnings or net
    earnings per Common Share.

Second, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company
    completed the sale of the PTS Business for approximately
    $3.2 billion in cash. The Company used the after-tax net
    proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion to repurchase its
    Common Shares. The Company recognized an after-tax book gain of
    approximately $1.1 billion from this transaction. The
    assets and liabilities of the PTS Business were classified as
    held for sale in prior periods and its operating results were
    classified within discontinued operations for all periods
    presented. See Note 8 in the “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for additional information on the
    Company’s discontinued operations.

The Company’s remaining four segments after the sale of the
    PTS business align within two sectors: the Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services sector, which includes the Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Medical segments, and the Clinical
    and Medical Products sector, which includes the Clinical
    Technologies and Services and Medical Products Manufacturing
    segments. The Healthcare Supply Chain Services sector focuses on
    delivering

best-in-class

distribution and logistics services to its customers. The sector
    generates 95% of total segment revenue, approximately
    three-quarters of total segment profit (as defined below in the
    “Segment Results of Operations” section) and
    consistent and reliable cash flow. The Clinical and Medical
    Products sector focuses largely on developing innovative
    products for hospitals and other providers of care. The sector,
    with its higher margin products and services and faster growing
    segment profit has grown to contribute approximately one-fourth
    of total segment profit.

Third, during fiscal 2007, the Company acquired Viasys, MedMined
    and Care Fusion along with other acquisitions. Viasys is a
    leader in respiratory care through the development and marketing
    of systems for critical care and diagnostic use and offers
    products and services directed at critical care ventilation,
    respiratory diagnostics and clinical services, neurological,
    vascular, audio, homecare, orthopedics, sleep diagnostics and
    other medical and surgical products markets. The value of the
    transaction, including the assumption of Viasys’s debt,
    totaled approximately $1.5 billion. Viasys is being
    integrated into the Medical Products Manufacturing segment. The
    Company also acquired MedMined, a leader in tracking and
    predicting infection management opportunities within major
    hospitals and Care Fusion, which focuses on bedside bar code
    utilization for tracking hospital samples. Both businesses are
    being integrated into the Clinical Technologies and Services
    segment. For further information regarding the Company’s
    acquisitions see “Item 1 —
    Business — Acquisitions and Divestitures,”
    “Other Matters — Acquisitions” below and
    Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.”

For further information regarding the Company’s business,
    see “Item 1 — Business” within this

Form 10-K.

Financial
    Overview

Continued demand for the Company’s products and services in
    fiscal 2007 led to revenue of $86.9 billion, up 9% from
    fiscal 2006. Operating earnings, which were negatively impacted
    by special items ($772 million), decreased 26% to
    approximately $1.4 billion. The significant increase in
    special items related to reserves for litigation settlements
    ($655 million) and in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”) expenses primarily in connection with
    the Viasys acquisition ($85 million). The year-over-year
    operating earnings comparison was



favorably impacted by increased gross margin ($431 million)
    partially offset by increases in selling, general and
    administrative expenses ($200 million). Net earnings, which
    included the gain from the sale of the PTS Business
    ($1.1 billion), were $1.9 billion and net diluted
    earnings per Common Share were $4.77.

Fiscal 2007 cash from operating activities decreased
    $898 million to $1.2 billion primarily due to the
    payment of litigation settlement reserves and government fines
    ($690 million) as discussed in the “Special
    Items” section below. Cash provided by investing activities
    was $1.5 billion due primarily to net proceeds from the PTS
    Business divesture ($3.1 billion) offset by cash paid for
    acquisitions ($1.6 billion). Cash used in financing
    activities was $2.6 billion due to the Company’s cash
    payments for treasury shares ($3.7 billion) offset by net
    proceeds from borrowings ($631 million) and issuance of
    shares ($553 million).

During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased approximately
    $3.8 billion of its Common Shares under a $4.5 billion
    repurchase authorization of which $3.7 billion was settled
    prior to year-end. On August 8, 2007, the Company announced
    a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program which expires
    on August 31, 2009. See the table under
    “Item 5 — Market for Registrant’s
    Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
    of Equity Securities” for more information regarding the
    share repurchases. Also during fiscal 2007, the Company paid
    $144 million in dividends or $0.36 per share. In the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007, the Board of Directors raised the
    quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.12 per share. The share
    repurchase activity (apart from the use of net proceeds from the
    PTS Business divestiture) and increased dividend payments
    support the Company’s previously stated long-term goal to
    return 50% of net cash provided by operating activities from
    continuing operations to shareholders and to increase its
    dividend payout to 20% of earnings per share.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company changed
    the classification of certain immaterial implementation costs
    associated with the sale of medication and supply storage
    devices in the Clinical Technologies and Services segment from
    selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of products
    sold. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    the new presentation.



(3)

Equity-based compensation expense was $138 million,
    $208 million and $9 million, respectively, for the
    fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Revenue

Revenue increased $7.2 billion or 9% during fiscal 2007 due
    to growth in each of the Company’s four reportable
    segments, including revenue growth of $6.5 billion within
    the Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    segment, due primarily to growth in revenue from bulk customers
    ($4.0 billion). The increase in revenue from bulk customers
    was due to certain existing customers deciding to purchase a
    greater volume of product from the Company rather than directly
    from the manufacturer and to pharmaceutical price appreciation.
    The Company uses the internal metric “pharmaceutical price
    appreciation index” to evaluate the impact of
    pharmaceutical and consumer product price appreciation on
    revenue from the pharmaceutical supply chain business. This
    metric is calculated using the change in the manufacturer’s
    published price at the beginning of the period as compared to
    the end of the period weighted by the units sold by the
    pharmaceutical supply chain business during the period. The
    pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 6.3% during fiscal
    2007. The Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical segment represents approximately 86% of total
    segment revenue. Refer to “Segment Results of
    Operations” below for further discussion of the specific
    factors affecting revenue in each of the Company’s
    reportable segments.

Revenue increased $7.0 billion or 10% during fiscal 2006
    due to increased revenue within each of the Company’s four
    reportable segments, including revenue growth of
    $6.4 billion within the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment, due primarily to
    growth in revenue from bulk customers ($5.8 billion). The
    increase in revenue from bulk customers was due to overall
    market growth and certain existing customers deciding to
    purchase a greater volume of product from the Company rather
    than directly from the manufacturer. The pharmaceutical price
    appreciation index was 5.6% during fiscal 2006.

Cost
    of Products Sold

Cost of products sold increased $6.8 billion or 9% and
    $6.6 billion or 10%, respectively, for the fiscal years
    ended June 30, 2007 and 2006. The increases in cost of
    products sold were mainly due to the respective 9% and 10%
    growth in revenue for fiscal 2007 and 2006. See the “Gross
    Margin” discussion below for further discussion of
    additional factors impacting cost of products sold.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin increased $431 million or 9% for the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 2007 over the prior fiscal year. The
    increase in gross margin was primarily due to revenue growth of
    $7.2 billion. Factors favorably impacting gross margin
    included increased sales of clinical and medical products and
    related services ($204 million), increased manufacturer
    cash discounts ($193 million), generic pharmaceutical
    margin ($192 million) and distribution service agreement
    fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation (combined impact of
    $171 million). Gross margin was negatively impacted by the
    increase in customer discounts within the Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Medical segments ($324 million)
    due to increased sales and competitive pricing pressures. Refer
    to the “Segment Results of Operations” below for
    further discussion of the specific factors affecting gross
    margin in each of the Company’s reportable segments.

Due to the competitive markets in which the Company’s
    businesses operate, the Company expects competitive pricing
    pressures to continue; however, the Company expects the margin
    impact of these pricing pressures will be mitigated through
    sales growth of higher margin manufactured products, effective
    product sourcing, realization of synergies through integration
    of acquired businesses and continued focus on cost controls.

Gross margin increased $354 million or 8% for the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 2006. The increase in gross margin was
    primarily due to revenue growth of $7.0 billion. Gross
    margin was favorably impacted by increased gross margin in
    clinical and manufactured products and related services
    ($211 million) and manufacturer cash discounts
    ($139 million) and distribution service agreement fees and
    pharmaceutical price appreciation (combined impact of
    $134 million) from the pharmaceutical supply chain business
    within the Healthcare Supply Chain



Services — Pharmaceutical segment. Gross margin was
    negatively impacted by increased customer discounts
    ($232 million) in the pharmaceutical supply chain business.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (“SG&A”)
    Expenses

SG&A expenses increased $200 million or 7% during
    fiscal 2007 primarily in support of revenue growth. Additional
    items impacting SG&A expenses included increases due to
    acquisitions ($72 million) and the Company’s
    charitable contribution to the Cardinal Health Foundation
    ($30 million). SG&A expenses were favorably impacted
    by the year-over-year reduction in equity-based compensation
    expense ($70 million). The reduction in equity-based
    compensation expense was due in part to changes made to the
    Company’s equity compensation program and the grant of
    stock appreciation rights in the prior year. Refer to
    “Segment Results of Operations” below for further
    discussion of the specific factors affecting SG&A expenses
    in each of the Company’s reportable segments.

The Company expects SG&A expenses to grow in fiscal 2008 in
    support of sales growth and new product and service offerings
    and as a result of the impact of acquisitions and continued
    investment in research and development projects and
    international expansion; however, the Company does expect to
    generate expense efficiencies through the integration of
    acquired companies and other cost controls.

SG&A expenses increased $385 million or 15% during
    fiscal 2006 primarily in support of the $7.0 billion
    revenue growth and as a result of increased equity-based
    compensation expense ($199 million), primarily due to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). See “Other
    Matters — Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)”
    below and Note 18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for additional information regarding
    equity-based compensation. Additional items impacting SG&A
    expenses included increased incentive compensation expense
    ($36 million) due to improved operating performance,
    incremental expenses associated with the Company’s global
    restructuring program ($38 million) and increased legal
    expenses ($15 million) due to then-outstanding litigation.

Impairment
    Charges and Other

The Company recognized impairment charges and other of
    $17 million, $6 million and $38 million,
    respectively, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007,
    2006 and 2005. See Note 3 of “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for additional information regarding
    impairment charges and other.

    ($40 million) and other matters. These charges were offset
    by $29 million of income related to pharmaceutical
    manufacturer antitrust litigation. In addition, the Company
    settled and made payment for the penalty associated with the SEC
    investigation ($35 million), which was reserved in fiscal
    2006 and 2005. These settlements resolve some of the
    Company’s most significant outstanding litigation as well
    as the SEC investigation. In fiscal 2008, the Company expects to
    recognize approximately $58 million in proceeds as income
    from insurance policies upon final settlement of all claims in
    shareholder derivative actions. See Note 12 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
    further discussion of these matters and other outstanding legal
    proceedings and regulatory matters.



During fiscal 2007, the Company recorded $85 million of
    IPR&D charges primarily associated with the Viasys
    acquisition. The IPR&D charges were determined by an
    independent third-party appraisal and represent the estimated
    fair value of the research and development projects in-process
    at the time of the acquisition. These projects had not yet
    reached technological feasibility, were deemed to have no
    alternative use and, accordingly, were immediately charged to
    operating expense at the acquisition date.

Fiscal 2006 and 2005 special items charges primarily related to
    the Company’s restructuring programs, the SEC investigation
    and Audit Committee internal review, the integration costs of
    certain acquisitions and settlements received from vitamin
    antitrust litigation. See Note 3 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for details of the
    Company’s special items.

Operating
    Earnings

Operating earnings decreased $471 million or 26% during
    fiscal 2007, which includes increased special items charges
    ($692 million) and impairment and other charges
    ($12 million). Operating earnings were favorably impacted
    by gross margin growth ($431 million) and negatively
    impacted by increased SG&A expenses ($200 million).

Operating earnings increased $63 million or 4% during
    fiscal 2006. Operating earnings were favorably impacted by gross
    margin growth ($354 million) and the year-over-year
    decrease in special items charges ($61 million) and
    impairment charges and other ($33 million). Fiscal 2006
    operating earnings were negatively impacted by increased
    SG&A expenses ($385 million).

Interest
    Expense and Other

Interest expense and other increased $17 million or 16%
    during fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased borrowing levels
    and interest rates. Interest expense and other decreased
    $13 million during fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase
    in investment income ($7 million) and foreign exchange
    gains ($4 million).

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before
    income taxes and discontinued operations were 32.9%, 33.2% and
    35.9% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate
    are due to changes within international and U.S. state
    effective tax rates resulting from the Company’s business
    mix and changes in the tax impact of special items, which may
    have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item
    and the taxing jurisdiction. The Company’s effective tax
    rate reflects tax benefits derived from increasing operations
    outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates
    lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. The Company has
    tax incentive agreements in several

non-U.S. tax

jurisdictions which will expire in fiscal years 2009 through
    2024 if not renewed. The Company does not believe that potential
    changes from existing tax incentive agreements will have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position
    or results of operations.

The Company’s fiscal 2007 provision for income taxes
    relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued
    operations was $412.6 million and the effective tax rate
    was 32.9%. The fiscal 2007 effective tax rate benefited by
    0.2 percentage points from equity-based compensation
    expense, which is deductible at a tax rate higher than the
    average tax rate. The fiscal 2007 effective tax rate was
    adversely impacted by 0.75 percentage points due to the
    non-deductibility of certain special items and impairments,
    principally the IPR&D charge related to the Viasys
    acquisition.

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to
    U.S. federal or

non-U.S. income

tax audits by tax authorities for fiscal years ending before
    June 30, 2001. The years subsequent to fiscal 2000 contain
    matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of
    applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount

and/or

timing of income, deductions and tax credits. The Internal
    Revenue Service (“IRS”) currently has ongoing
    examinations of open years from 2001 through 2005. Although the
    outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes
    that adequate amounts of tax and interest have been provided for
    any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.
    While it is not currently possible to predict the impact of
    settlements or other IRS



audit activity on income tax expense or cash flows during the
    next 12 months, the Company does not expect any significant
    impact on financial position.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the effective tax rate
    from continuing operations was favorably impacted by a
    $9.9 million adjustment to the tax reserves primarily due
    to the issuance of a final IRS Revenue Agent Report that related
    to fiscal years 2001 and 2002. During the second quarter of
    fiscal 2007, the effective tax rate from continuing operations
    was negatively impacted by a $7.3 million adjustment to the
    tax reserves related to an ongoing international tax audit.
    During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company entered
    into an agreement with the IRS to close the fiscal years 1996
    through 2000 federal audits. As a result, the Company reversed
    tax reserves of approximately $8.9 million.

The Company’s fiscal 2006 provision for income taxes
    relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued
    operations was $577.1 million and the effective tax rate
    was 33.2%. The fiscal 2006 effective tax rate was adversely
    impacted by 0.2 percentage points due to the
    non-deductibility of certain special items.

A provision of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (“AJCA”) created a temporary incentive for
    U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned
    abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for
    certain dividends from

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined
    that it would repatriate $500 million of accumulated

non-U.S. earnings

in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the
    AJCA, and accordingly, the Company recorded a related tax
    liability of $26.3 million as of June 30, 2005. The
    $500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the
    Company under the repatriation provisions of the AJCA. During
    fiscal 2006, the Company repatriated $494 million of
    qualifying accumulated foreign earnings in accordance with its
    plan adopted during fiscal 2005. An additional tax liability of
    $0.4 million was recorded during fiscal 2006 due to new
    state legislation with respect to the AJCA, bringing the
    Company’s total tax liability related to the repatriation
    recorded through June 30, 2006 to $26.7 million. Uses
    of repatriated funds included domestic expenditures related to
    non-executive salaries, capital asset investments and other
    permitted activities. See Note 11 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
    information.

Discontinued
    Operations

Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax increased by
    $1.3 billion during fiscal 2007 primarily due to the
    after-tax gain on the sale of the PTS Business
    ($1.1 billion) and impairment charges from prior year
    ($185 million). See Note 8 in “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information
    on the Company’s discontinued operations.

Segment
    Results of Operations

Reportable
    Segments

The Company’s operations are organized into four reportable
    segments: Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical; Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical; Clinical Technologies and Services; and Medical
    Products Manufacturing. The Company evaluates the performance of
    the individual segments based upon, among other things, segment
    profit. Segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of
    products sold, less segment SG&A expenses. Segment
    SG&A expense includes equity compensation expense as well
    as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including
    corporate management, corporate finance, financial shared
    services, human resources, information technology, legal and
    legislative affairs and the integrated sales organization.
    Corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based upon
    headcount, level of benefit provided and ratable allocation.
    Information about interest income and expense and income taxes
    is not provided at the segment level. In addition, special
    items, impairment charges and other and investment spending are
    not allocated to the segments. See Note 17 in the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
    additional information on the Company’s reportable segments.

Revenue increased in each of the Company’s four reportable
    segments during fiscal 2007, including double-digit growth in
    the Medical Products Manufacturing (12%) and Clinical
    Technologies and Services (11%) segments. Segment profit
    increased in each of the Company’s four reportable
    segments, including double-digit



growth in the Medical Products Manufacturing (20%), Clinical
    Technologies and Services (20%) and Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical (14%) segments.

A portion of the corporate costs previously allocated to the
    former Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment have
    been reclassified to the remaining four segments based upon each
    segment’s respective



proportion of allocated corporate expenses. In addition,
    equity-based compensation has been allocated to the segments
    based upon the forecasted equity-based compensation expense for
    the respective segment plus one-fourth of the forecasted
    corporate equity-based compensation expense. Prior period
    information has been adjusted to reflect these changes in
    methodology.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    Performance

During fiscal 2007, Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased $6.5 billion or 9%
    primarily from revenue from bulk customers. Segment profit
    increased $157 million due to revenue growth, increased
    generic pharmaceutical margin and increased distribution service
    agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation, offset by
    increased customer discounts and increased SG&A expenses.
    The pharmaceutical distribution market remains highly
    competitive and the Company expects that customer discounts will
    continue to increase. However, the Company expects that
    increased manufacturer cash discounts and distribution service
    agreement fees, both of which increase with revenue growth,
    combined with increased generic margin and continued
    pharmaceutical price appreciation will enable the Company to
    offset increased customer discounts. The Company’s results
    could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products
    decline, the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches
    decreases or pharmaceutical price appreciation decreases from
    its historical rate. Alternatively, the Company’s results
    could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase, the
    frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases or
    pharmaceutical price appreciation exceeds its historical rate.

Revenue from bulk customers, described below, increased
    $4.0 billion during fiscal 2007 with additional volume from
    existing customers ($2.7 billion) and new customers
    ($1.3 billion). Revenue from non-bulk customers increased
    $2.5 billion. Growth in revenue from non-bulk customers was
    driven by additional sales volume from existing customers and
    pharmaceutical price appreciation ($4.0 billion). The
    pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 6.3% for fiscal
    2007. Acquisitions ($1.2 billion), mainly Dohmen and
    ParMed, also had a favorable impact on the year-over-year
    revenue comparison. Negatively impacting growth in revenue from
    non-bulk customers was the loss of existing customers due to
    competition ($1.0 billion) and the sale of a significant
    part of the specialty distribution business ($1.7 billion)
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.



Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    segment profit increased $157 million or 14% in fiscal
    2007. Gross margin increased segment profit by $202 million
    primarily due to the segment’s revenue growth and increased
    generic pharmaceutical margin ($192 million) due to new
    product launches and competitive vendor pricing. Gross margin
    also was favorably impacted by increased manufacturer cash
    discounts due to sales volume growth ($187 million) and
    distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price
    appreciation (combined impact of $171 million). Gross
    margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts
    ($319 million) due to increased sales volume and
    competitive pressures. The Company expects continued customer
    discounting due to the competitive market in which it operates.
    Increases in segment SG&A expenses negatively impacted
    segment profit by approximately $45 million for fiscal
    2007. Increases in SG&A expenses were in support of the
    increased sales volume and due to the impact of acquisitions
    ($37 million). Favorably impacting SG&A expenses was
    the reduction in equity-based compensation expense
    ($14 million). Segment profit was negatively impacted by
    the prior year sale of a significant portion of the specialty
    distribution business ($43 million).

The Company estimates that branded pharmaceuticals with
    industry-wide sales volume domestically of $21.8 billion
    and $4.4 billion came off of patent protection during
    fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, which allowed for generic
    pharmaceutical competition. The Company’s estimate of
    industry-wide branded pharmaceutical sales volume is internally
    developed using industry sales data for significant branded
    pharmaceuticals adapted for the Company’s fiscal period.
    Generic pharmaceuticals negatively impact revenue because they
    are offered at lower prices than branded pharmaceuticals;
    however, generic pharmaceuticals positively impact gross margin
    and operating earnings due to competitive vendor pricing. The
    Company generally earns the highest margins on generic
    pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the
    initial launch of a generic product to the marketplace because
    generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally
    deflationary. The Company expects a similar level of branded
    pharmaceuticals will come off of patent protection during fiscal
    2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

During fiscal 2006, Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased $6.4 billion or
    10%. Revenue from bulk customers increased $5.8 billion.
    Centralized warehouse and mail order customers contributed
    $5.0 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of the
    bulk customer revenue growth. The additional sales volume was
    due in significant part to certain existing warehouse customers
    deciding to purchase from the Company rather than directly from
    the manufacturer. Revenue from non-bulk customers increased
    $604 million based upon pharmaceutical price appreciation
    and additional sales volume from new and existing customers.
    Revenue growth was negatively impacted as a result of the
    decision of the specialty distribution business’s largest
    customer to begin self distribution on January 1, 2006 and
    the sale of a significant portion of the specialty distribution
    business in the fourth quarter ($190 million). The
    pharmaceutical price appreciation index was 5.6% for fiscal 2006.

Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    segment profit decreased $81 million or 7% in fiscal 2006.
    Gross margin increased segment profit by $70 million due
    primarily to the segment’s revenue growth and increased
    manufacturer cash discounts ($139 million) due to increased
    sales within the pharmaceutical supply chain business. In
    addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by distribution
    service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation
    (combined impact of $134 million). Other factors favorably
    impacting gross margin included generic pharmaceuticals
    ($32 million) due to sales growth, competitive vendor
    pricing, the introduction of new generic pharmaceuticals within
    the pharmaceutical supply chain business, the addition of new
    vendors to the segment’s National Logistics Center
    ($27 million) and a

last-in,

first-out

(“LIFO”) reserve reduction ($26 million)
    primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical
    inventories.

Increased customer discounts within the pharmaceutical supply
    chain business negatively impacted segment profit by
    $232 million due to increased sales volume and competitive
    pressures. Segment profit was also negatively impacted by an
    adjustment ($32 million), as described in detail below.
    Increases in segment SG&A expenses negatively impacted
    segment profit by approximately $151 million for fiscal
    2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Increases in these expenses were
    in support of the increased sales volume and increased
    equity-based compensation expense ($67 million) due
    primarily to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

As noted above, Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical segment profit was negatively impacted by an
    adjustment recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The
    Company discovered it had inadvertently and



erroneously failed to process credits owed to a vendor in prior
    years. After a thorough review, the Company determined it had
    failed to process similar credits for a limited number of
    additional vendors. These processing failures, specific to a
    limited area of vendor credits, resulted from system
    programming, interface and data entry errors relating to these
    vendor credits which occurred over a period of years. As a
    result, the Company recorded a charge ($32 million) in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting its estimate of the
    credits owed to these vendors.

Bulk and Non-Bulk Customers

.

The
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    segment differentiates between bulk and non-bulk customers
    because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment
    profit as a percentage of revenue than non-bulk customers. Bulk
    customers consist of customers’ centralized warehouse
    operations and customers’ mail order businesses. All other
    customers are classified as non-bulk customers (for example,
    retail stores, pharmacies, hospitals and alternate care sites).
    Bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains
    whose retail stores are classified as non-bulk customers. For
    example, a single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a
    bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a
    non-bulk customer with respect to its retail stores. Bulk
    customers have the ability to process large quantities of
    products in central locations and self-distribute these products
    to their individual retail stores or customers. Substantially
    all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in
    the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer,
    but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken
    down into smaller units prior to shipping. Non-bulk customers,
    on the other hand, require more complex servicing by the
    Company. These services, all of which are performed by the
    Company, include receiving inventory in large or full case
    quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities,
    warehousing the product for a longer period of time, picking
    individual products specific to a customer’s order and
    delivering that smaller order to a customer location.

The Company tracks revenue by bulk and non-bulk customers in its
    financial systems. To assist the Company in managing its
    business, an internal analysis has been prepared to allocate
    segment expenses (total of segment cost of products sold and
    segment selling, general and administrative expenses) separately
    for bulk and non-bulk customers. The following table shows the
    allocation of segment expenses, segment profit and segment
    profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non-bulk
    customers for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in millions):

Amounts shown are estimates based upon the internal analysis
    described above. The preparation of this internal analysis
    required the use of complex and subjective estimates and
    allocations based upon assumptions, past experience and judgment
    that the Company believes are reasonable. The core
    pharmaceutical distribution operation (“Distribution”)
    within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical segment services both bulk and non-bulk
    customers. Therefore, expenses associated with this operation
    were allocated between bulk and non-bulk customers as described
    below. The brokerage operation (“Brokerage”) within
    the Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    segment only services bulk customers, therefore, expenses
    associated with Brokerage are allocated to bulk customers. The
    remaining operations (i.e. excluding Distribution and Brokerage)
    within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical segment service non-bulk customers, therefore,
    expenses associated with these operations were allocated to
    non-bulk customers.



The following describes the allocation of the major components
    of cost of products sold for Distribution  between bulk and
    non-bulk customers:

•

Cost of products sold for pharmaceutical products is determined
    by specifically tracking the manufacturer’s designated
    price of products, at the time the products are sold, by bulk
    and non-bulk customers. The manufacturer’s designated price
    is then reduced by other components impacting cost of products
    sold, including distribution service agreement fees,
    pharmaceutical price appreciation, manufacturer cash discounts
    and manufacturer rebates and incentives. In addition, other
    inventory charges and credits are added or subtracted, as
    appropriate, to arrive at cost of products sold. The Company
    used the following methods that it believes provide a reasonable
    correlation to allocate the remaining components of cost of
    products sold between bulk and non-bulk customers.

The Company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable
    correlation to allocate the selling, general and administrative
    expenses for Distribution between bulk and non-bulk customers as
    follows:

(2)

Amounts exclude LIFO credit provisions of $0, $26 million
    and $32 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage
    of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for non-bulk
    customers because of higher segment cost of products sold
    partially offset by lower segment SG&A expenses. Bulk
    customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products
    than non-bulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive
    market and the lower costs related to the services provided by
    the Company. In



addition, sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher
    segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than
    sales to non-bulk customers because bulk customers’ orders
    consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products. The
    higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue
    for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer
    distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical
    price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts.
    Manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and
    manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to
    segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of
    revenue due to the mix of products sold. Pharmaceutical price
    appreciation increases customer pricing which, in turn, results
    in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was
    on-hand at the time of the manufacturer’s price increase.
    Since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in
    inventory for a shorter time than products sold to non-bulk
    customers, there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of
    pharmaceutical price appreciation. Consequently, segment cost of
    products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is
    higher than for non-bulk customers and segment gross margin as a
    percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers
    than for non-bulk customers. Deliveries to bulk customers
    require substantially less services by the Company than
    deliveries to non-bulk customers. As such, the segment SG&A
    expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are
    substantially lower than from non-bulk customers. These factors
    result in segment profit as a percentage of revenue being
    significantly lower for bulk customers than for non-bulk
    customers.

The Company defines bulk customers based on the way in which the
    Company operates its business and the services it performs for
    its customers. The Company is not aware of an industry standard
    regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a
    review of the Annual Reports on

Form 10-K

of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers, the Company notes
    that other companies in comparable businesses may, or may not,
    use a different definition of bulk customers.

During fiscal 2007, segment profit from bulk customers increased
    $35 million, or 0.1% of revenue from bulk customers, due to
    increased sales volume described above and the year-over-year
    increase in distribution service agreement fees and
    pharmaceutical price appreciation. Segment profit for non-bulk
    customers increased $148 million, or 0.2% of revenue from
    non-bulk customers, compared to fiscal 2006. This increase in
    segment profit from non-bulk customers was due primarily to the
    increase in sales volume described above and the impact of
    generic products which had a greater impact on the profitability
    of non-bulk customers due to the mix of pharmaceuticals
    distributed to non-bulk customers.

Fiscal 2006 segment profit from bulk customers increased
    $60 million, or 0.1% of revenue from bulk customers, due to
    increased sales volume described above and the year-over-year
    impact of new distribution service agreements and pharmaceutical
    price appreciation. The favorable impact of distribution service
    agreements and of pharmaceutical price appreciation had a
    greater impact on the profitability of bulk customers than on
    non-bulk customers in fiscal 2006 due to the mix of branded
    pharmaceuticals distributed to bulk customers. These positive
    factors were partially offset by an increase in allocated
    equity-based compensation expense of $10 million due to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The fiscal 2006 segment
    profit for non-bulk customers declined $136 million, or
    0.4% of revenue from non-bulk customers, compared to fiscal
    2005. An increase in segment profit from non-bulk customers due
    to increased sales and new distribution service agreements was
    offset by increased customer discounts, an increase in segment
    SG&A expenses (which was largely due to sales growth and an
    increase in allocated equity-based compensation expense of
    $57 million due to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R)), and a $32 million charge during
    the first quarter of fiscal 2006 reflecting credits owed to
    vendors.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Medical
    Performance

During fiscal 2007, Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical segment revenue increased $315 million while
    segment profit remained relatively flat. The Company remains
    focused on improving operating performance within this segment
    through continued investment in customer service and
    restructuring the business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2007, the Company announced its plan to combine the headquarters
    of the Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical and Medical segments in order to promote sharing
    best practices and support functions to provide better service
    for its customers. Refer to “Other Matters —
    Global Restructuring Program” below for further discussion
    of the Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical restructuring program.

Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment
    revenue growth of $315 million or 4% during fiscal 2007
    resulted primarily from increased volume from existing customers
    ($215 million) and new customer accounts
    ($100 million). Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical segment profit increased
    $4 million or 1% during



fiscal 2007. Gross margin increased segment profit by
    $27 million primarily as a result of revenue growth and the
    impact of increased manufacturer cash discounts
    ($6 million). Negatively impacting gross margin were
    increased customer discounts ($5 million) and trade
    receivable reserves ($7 million) related to the
    segment’s customer service and shared service transition.
    Increases in SG&A expenses decreased segment profit by
    $23 million primarily in support of revenue growth and
    increased transportation costs ($5 million). Favorably
    impacting SG&A expenses was the reduction in equity-based
    compensation expense ($14 million).

During fiscal 2006, Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical segment revenue growth of $376 million or 6%
    resulted primarily from increased volume from existing customers
    ($244 million) and new customer accounts
    ($115 million). Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical segment profit decreased
    $53 million or 14% during fiscal 2006. Gross margin
    increased segment profit by $53 million as a result of
    revenue growth and the favorable impact of the mix of
    private-label and branded products ($9 million) due to
    emphasis being placed on selling Company branded products and
    other focused product categories and new products with higher
    margins ($4 million). Increases in SG&A expenses
    decreased segment profit by $106 million in support of
    revenue growth and an increase in

equity-based

compensation expense ($45 million) due primarily to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

Clinical
    Technologies and Services Performance

During fiscal 2007, Clinical Technologies and Services segment
    revenue grew $257 million or 11%. Revenue growth was
    favorably impacted by new products ($119 million),
    increased sales volumes to existing customers ($90 million)
    due to renewals and expansion of product lines and new customers
    ($35 million). Acquisitions also favorably impacted the
    year-over-year comparison ($18 million).

Clinical Technologies and Services segment profit increased
    $65 million or 20%. Gross margin increased segment profit
    by $132 million primarily as a result of revenue growth.
    Gross margin was negatively impacted by the estimated costs of
    the Alaris SE pump corrective action plan and related consulting
    expenses ($18 million) due to the product recall. Increases
    in SG&A expenses decreased segment profit by
    $67 million in support of the revenue growth and as a
    result of the impact of acquisitions ($22 million) and
    increased investment in product quality and research and
    development costs ($11 million). Favorably impacting
    SG&A expenses was the reduction in equity-based
    compensation expense ($14 million).

During fiscal 2006, Clinical Technologies and Services segment
    revenue growth of $241 million or 11% resulted primarily
    from revenue growth within the Pyxis and Alaris product lines.
    Pyxis products revenue increased $83 million due to higher
    unit sales resulting from increased demand for the
    Medstation

®

3000 product and improvements within the sales and installation
    cycles. Alaris products revenue increased $125 million due
    to competitive displacements driven by technological advantages
    and sales obtained through the Company’s other
    relationships. These revenue increases were tempered by slower
    revenue growth in the clinical and consulting services
    ($52 million).

Clinical Technologies and Services segment profit increased
    $82 million or 35% during fiscal 2006. Gross margin
    increased segment profit by $180 million primarily as a
    result of revenue growth. Factors favorably impacting gross
    margin included sales mix ($49 million) and manufacturing
    efficiencies ($12 million) driven by higher sales volume.
    Also favorably impacting the year-over-year comparison were the
    inventory valuation adjustments to fair value from the Alaris
    acquisition ($24 million) with the adjusted higher value
    inventory being sold during the first two quarters of fiscal
    2005. Increases in SG&A expenses decreased segment profit
    by $97 million due primarily to an increase in equity-based
    compensation expense ($55 million) due primarily to the
    adoption of SFAS 123(R) and in support of the revenue
    growth. Estimated integration synergies from the Alaris
    acquisition ($54 million) favorably impacted both gross
    margin and SG&A expenses.

Medical
    Products Manufacturing Performance

During fiscal 2007, Medical Products Manufacturing segment
    revenue grew $203 million or 12%. Revenue growth was
    favorably impacted by increased sales volume ($74 million)
    from existing customers and new customers won through new GPO
    contracts and competitor exits. Revenue growth was also
    favorably impacted by new product launches ($50 million),
    including innovations in gloves, respiratory products, surgical
    instruments and software, and international revenue growth
    ($62 million), which includes the impact of foreign
    exchange ($18 million). Acquisitions, including Denver
    Biomedical and Viasys, favorably impacted the year-over-year



comparison ($37 million). Due to the acquisition of Viasys,
    the Company expects significant growth in the Medical Products
    Manufacturing segment.

Medical Products Manufacturing segment profit increased
    $33 million or 20% during fiscal 2007. Gross margin
    increased segment profit by $72 million primarily as a
    result of revenue growth. Factors favorably impacting gross
    margin included manufacturing cost reductions ($20 million)
    driven by strategic sourcing and expense control related to the
    Company’s restructuring program and the integration of
    acquisitions ($21 million), primarily Denver Biomedical.
    Increases in SG&A expenses negatively impacted segment
    profit by $39 million primarily in support of the
    segment’s revenue growth and from the impact of
    acquisitions ($13 million). Favorably impacting SG&A
    expenses was the reduction in equity-based compensation expense
    ($12 million).

During fiscal 2006, Medical Products Manufacturing segment
    revenue grew $96 million or 6% resulting from revenue
    growth from manufactured gloves and respiratory product lines
    ($45 million) due to new customer accounts
    ($14 million) and new products ($31 million) and
    international revenue growth ($16 million) from new
    customers.

Medical Products Manufacturing segment profit decreased
    $11 million or 6% during fiscal 2006. Gross margin
    increased segment profit by $31 million primarily as a
    result of revenue growth. Factors favorably impacting gross
    margin included manufacturing cost reductions driven by cost
    controls ($30 million) and expense control partially
    related to the Company’s global restructuring program
    ($12 million). Increased raw materials costs
    ($25 million) negatively impacted gross margin. Increases
    in SG&A expenses negatively impacted segment profit by
    $42 million primarily due to the increase in equity-based
    compensation ($41 million) and in support of the
    segment’s revenue growth. The latex litigation charge
    ($28 million) recorded during fiscal 2005 also favorably
    impacted the year-over-year comparison.

Other
    Matters

Acquisitions

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company acquired
    Viasys, which offered products and services directed at critical
    care ventilation, respiratory diagnostics and clinical services,
    neurological, vascular, audio, homecare, orthopedics, sleep
    diagnostics and other medical and surgical products markets. The
    value of the transaction, including the assumption of
    Viasys’s debt, totaled approximately $1.5 billion. In
    addition, during fiscal 2007, the Company completed other
    acquisitions that individually were not significant. The
    aggregate purchase price of these other acquisitions, which was
    paid in cash, was approximately $165 million. Assumed
    liabilities of these acquired businesses were approximately
    $22 million. The consolidated financial statements include
    the results of operations from each of these business
    combinations from the date of acquisition. Had the transactions,
    including Viasys, occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2006,
    consolidated results of operations would not have differed
    materially from reported results. For further information
    regarding the Company’s acquisitions see
    “Item 1 — Business — Acquisitions
    and Divestitures” and Note 2 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.”

During fiscal 2006, the Company completed acquisitions that
    individually were not significant. The aggregate purchase price
    of these acquisitions, which was paid in cash, was approximately
    $364 million. Assumed liabilities of these acquired
    businesses were approximately $149 million. The
    consolidated financial statements include the results of
    operations from each of these business combinations from the
    date of acquisition. Had the transactions occurred at the
    beginning of fiscal 2005, consolidated results of operations
    would not have differed materially.

During fiscal 2005, the Company completed acquisitions that
    individually were not significant. The aggregate purchase price
    of these acquisitions, which was paid in cash, was approximately
    $107 million. Assumed liabilities of these acquired
    businesses were approximately $27 million. The consolidated
    financial statements include the results of operations from each
    of these business combinations from the date of acquisition. Had
    the transactions occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2004,
    consolidated results of operations would not have differed
    materially.

The Company’s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to
    expand its role as a provider of services and innovative
    products to the healthcare industry. This trend has resulted in
    expansion into areas that complement the Company’s existing
    operations and provide opportunities for the Company to develop
    synergies with, and strengthen, the acquired business. As the
    healthcare industry continues to change, the Company evaluates
    possible



candidates for acquisition and considers opportunities to expand
    its role as a provider of services to the healthcare industry
    through all its reportable segments. There can be no assurance,
    however, that the Company will be able to successfully take
    advantage of any such opportunity if and when it arises or
    consummate any such transaction, if pursued. If additional
    transactions are pursued or consummated, the Company would incur
    additional acquisition integration charges, and may need to
    enter into funding arrangements for such acquisitions. There can
    be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any
    such transaction would be successful.

Sale
    of the PTS Business

On April 10, 2007, the Company completed the sale of the
    PTS Business to Phoenix Charter LLC (“Phoenix”), an
    affiliate of The Blackstone Group, pursuant to the Purchase and
    Sale Agreement between the Company and Phoenix, dated as of
    January 25, 2007 as amended (the “Purchase
    Agreement”). At the closing of the sale, the Company
    received approximately $3.2 billion in cash from Phoenix,
    which was the purchase price of approximately $3.3 billion
    as adjusted pursuant to certain provisions in the Purchase
    Agreement for the working capital, cash, indebtedness and
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    of the PTS Business. The Company recognized an after-tax book
    gain of approximately $1.1 billion from this transaction.
    The Company used the after-tax net proceeds of approximately
    $3.1 billion from the sale to repurchase shares. The
    Purchase Agreement contained customary indemnification
    provisions for sale transactions of this type.

Global
    Restructuring Program

During fiscal 2005, the Company launched a global restructuring
    program with a goal of increasing the value that the Company
    provides its customers through better integration of existing
    businesses and improved efficiency from a more disciplined
    approach to procurement and resource allocation. On
    April 30, 2007, the Company announced a third phase of its
    global restructuring program to move the headquarters of the
    Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical segment and certain corporate functions from Waukegan,
    Illinois to the Company’s corporate headquarters in Dublin,
    Ohio. The Company expects this third phase to be substantially
    completed by the end of fiscal 2009. See the Company’s

Form 8-K

filed on April 30, 2007 for additional information.

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R)

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R) applying the modified prospective
    method. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all equity-based
    payments to employees, including grants of employee options, to
    be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on
    the grant date fair value of the award. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the Company accounted for
    equity-based awards under the intrinsic value method, which
    followed the recognition and measurement principles of APB
    Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations, and
    equity-based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure
    within the notes to the financial statements. In anticipation of
    the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company did not
    modify the terms of any previously-granted options. See
    Note 18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for additional information regarding
    equity-based compensation.

Pharmaceutical
    Supply Chain Business Model Transition

Historically, a significant portion of the pharmaceutical supply
    chain business’ gross margin was derived from the
    Company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory,
    hold that inventory when a manufacturer increased prices, and
    sell that product at the higher price. Beginning in fiscal 2003,
    branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater
    control over the amount of product available in the supply chain
    and, as a result, began to change their sales practices by
    restricting the volume of product available for purchase by
    wholesalers. In addition, manufacturers sought additional
    services from the Company, including providing data concerning
    product sales and distribution patterns. The Company believes
    that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with
    greater visibility over product demand and movement in the
    market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing
    the risks associated with product being available to, and
    distributed in, the secondary market. These changes
    significantly reduced the pharmaceutical price appreciation
    earned by the Company.



In response to these developments, the Company established a
    compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers
    that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’
    pricing practices, and is based on the services provided by the
    Company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each
    manufacturer’s products. During fiscal 2005, the Company
    worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to
    define fee-for-service terms that compensate the Company based
    on the services being provided to such manufacturers. This
    transition was completed during fiscal 2006. These new
    arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which
    have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’
    price increases.

Under the fee-for-service arrangements, reflected in written
    distribution service agreements, the Company’s compensation
    for these services may be a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical
    price appreciation. In certain instances, the Company must
    achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees
    under the agreement. The fee is typically a fixed percentage of
    either the Company’s purchases from the manufacturer or the
    Company’s sales of the manufacturer’s products to its
    customers. The Company continues to generate gross margin from
    the sale of some manufacturers’ products from
    pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution
    service agreement fees. If the frequency or rate of branded
    pharmaceutical price appreciation slows, the Company’s
    results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
    affected.

Distribution service agreements between the Company and certain
    branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a
    one-year term with an automatic renewal feature to a five-year
    term. These agreements generally cannot be terminated unless
    mutually agreed by the parties, a breach of the agreement occurs
    that is not cured, or a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency
    event occurs. Some agreements allow the manufacturer to
    terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice
    period.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates

Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that
    can have a significant impact on the presentation of the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations,
    and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon
    past experience and management’s judgment. Other companies
    applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances
    could develop different estimates. Because of the uncertainty
    inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these
    estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements that management
    believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates
    and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see
    Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.”

Allowance
    for doubtful accounts

Trade receivables are amounts owed to the Company through its
    operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for
    doubtful accounts. The Company also provides financing to
    various customers. Such financing arrangements range from ninety
    days to ten years at interest rates that generally are subject
    to fluctuation. These financings may be collateralized,
    guaranteed by third parties or unsecured. Finance notes and
    accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance
    for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets.
    Extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance
    for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the
    Company’s management.

In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts,
    which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company
    reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer
    financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends
    and payment history to assess the probability of collection. The
    Company continuously monitors the collectibility of its
    receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts
    receivable, assessing credit worthiness of its customers and
    evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may
    impact credit risks. If the frequency or severity of customer
    defaults change due to changes in customers’ financial
    condition or general economic conditions, the Company’s
    allowance for doubtful accounts may require adjustment.

The allowance for doubtful accounts was $128.9 million and
    $126.4 million at June 30, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. This allowance represented 2.2% and 2.6% of
    customer receivables at June 30, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a
    percentage of revenue was 0.15%, 0.16% and 0.16% at
    June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The allowance
    for doubtful accounts was reduced by $28.4 million,



$22.6 million and $21.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006,
    and 2005, respectively, for customer deductions and write-offs
    and was increased by additional provisions of
    $24.0 million, $24.6 million and $7.7 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A hypothetical 0.1%
    increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade
    receivables and sales-type leases to the reserve at
    June 30, 2007 would result in an increase or decrease in
    bad debt expense of approximately $5.9 million.

Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical
    losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition,
    reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual
    circumstances or trends are present. The Company believes the
    reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2007 are
    appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies
    employed. At this time, the Company is not aware of any internal
    process or customer issues that might lead to a significant
    future increase in the Company’s allowance for doubtful
    accounts as a percentage of net revenue.

See Schedule II included in this

Form 10-K

which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance
    reserves.

Inventories

A substantial portion of inventories (approximately 73% and 75%
    at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively) are stated at the
    lower of cost, using the LIFO method, or market. These
    inventories are included within the core distribution facilities
    within the Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment (“core
    distribution facilities”) and are primarily merchandise
    inventories. The LIFO impact on the consolidated statement of
    earnings in a given year is dependent on pharmaceutical price
    appreciation and the level of inventory. Prices for branded
    pharmaceuticals are primarily inflationary, which results in an
    increase in cost of products sold, whereas prices for generic
    pharmaceuticals are deflationary, which results in a decrease in
    cost of products sold.

Under the LIFO method, it is assumed that the most recent
    inventory purchases are the first items sold. As such, the
    Company uses LIFO to better match current costs and revenue.
    Therefore, reductions in the overall inventory levels resulting
    from declining branded pharmaceutical inventory levels generally
    will result in a decrease in future cost of products sold, as
    the remaining inventory will be held at a lower cost due to the
    inflationary environment. Conversely, reductions in the overall
    inventory levels created by declining generic pharmaceutical
    inventory levels would generally increase future cost of
    products sold, as the remaining inventory will be held at a
    higher cost due to the deflationary environment. The Company
    believes that the average cost method of inventory valuation
    provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of
    replacing inventory within the core distribution facilities.  As
    such, the LIFO reserve is the difference between
    (a) inventory at the lower of LIFO cost or market and
    (b) inventory at replacement cost determined using the
    average cost method of inventory valuation. In fiscal 2007, the
    Company did not record any LIFO reserve reductions. The LIFO
    reserve reduction in fiscal 2006 of $26.0 million was
    primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical
    inventories.

The remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of
    cost, using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method, or market. If the Company
    had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all
    inventory within the core distribution facilities, inventories
    would not have changed in fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. In fact,
    primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical
    inventories, inventories at LIFO were $55.8 million and
    $1.0 million higher than the average cost value as of
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. However, the
    Company’s policy is not to record inventories in excess of
    its current market value.

Inventories recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory
    which were $95.8 million and $112.2 million at
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company reserves
    for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical
    experiences, sales trends, specific categories of inventory and
    age of on-hand inventory. If actual conditions are less
    favorable than the Company’s assumptions, additional
    inventory reserves may be required, however these would not be
    expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Business
    Combinations

Assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value
    of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
    combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many
    of the Company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible
    assets which require management to use significant judgment in
    determining fair value. The Company typically utilizes
    third-party valuation experts for this process. In addition,
    current and future amortization expense



for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations
    as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such
    intangibles, excluding goodwill. The Company believes the assets
    recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based
    upon current facts and circumstances.

In conjunction with the review of a transaction, the valuation
    experts assess the status of the acquired company’s
    research and development projects to determine the existence of
    IPR&D. In connection with the acquisitions of Viasys and
    Care Fusion, the Company was required to estimate the fair value
    of acquired IPR&D which required selecting an appropriate
    discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project.
    Management also assessed the current status of development,
    nature and timing of efforts to complete such development,
    uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value.
    Costs were not assigned to IPR&D unless future development
    was probable. Once the fair value was determined, an asset was
    established, and in accordance with FASB Interpretation
    No. 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to
    Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
    Method,” was immediately written-off as a special item in
    the Company’s consolidated statement of earnings. The
    Company recorded $83.9 million and $0.6 million as a
    special item in fiscal 2007 representing an estimate of
    Viasys’s and Care Fusion’s acquired IPR&D,
    respectively (see Note 3 of “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements”).

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with
    SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.” Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill
    and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized,
    but instead are tested for impairment annually or when
    indicators of impairment exist. Intangible assets with finite
    lives, primarily customer relationships and patents and
    trademarks, continue to be amortized over their useful lives. In
    conducting the impairment test, the fair value of the
    Company’s reporting units is compared to its carrying
    amount including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the
    carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying
    amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to
    assess impairment.

The Company’s determination of fair value of the reporting
    units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis or a review of
    the price/earnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar
    in nature, scope and size. The methods and assumptions used to
    test impairment have been revised for the segment realignment
    for the periods presented. The discount rate used for impairment
    testing is based on the risk-free rate plus an adjustment for
    risk factors. The use of alternative estimates, peer groups or
    changes in the industry, or adjusting the discount rate used
    could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and
    potentially result in impairment. Any identified impairment
    would result in an adjustment to the Company’s results of
    operations.

The Company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal 2007
    and 2006, neither of which resulted in the recognition of any
    impairment charges. Decreasing the price/earnings ratio of
    competitors used for impairment testing by one point or
    increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow
    analysis used for impairment testing by 1% would not have
    indicated impairment for any of the Company’s reporting
    units for fiscal 2007 or 2006. See Note 9 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
    information regarding goodwill and other intangibles.

Special
    Items

The Company records restructuring charges, acquisition
    integration charges and certain litigation and other items as
    special items. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the
    Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing
    facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing
    the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also
    involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of
    a business unit in response to changing market conditions.
    Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
    with Exit or Disposal Activities.” Under this Statement, a
    liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as
    incurred.

Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate
    acquired companies. Upon acquisition, certain integration
    charges are included within the purchase price allocation in
    accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations,” and other integration charges are recorded
    as special items as incurred.



Certain litigation recorded in special items consists of
    settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent,
    non-recurring or unusual in nature. The Company also classified
    legal fees and document preservation and production costs
    incurred in connection with the SEC investigation and the Audit
    Committee internal review and related matters as special items.

The majority of the special items related to acquisition
    integration and restructurings can be classified in one of the
    following categories: employee-related costs, exit costs
    (including lease termination costs), asset impairments and other
    integration costs. Employee costs include severance and
    termination benefits. Lease termination costs include lease
    cancellation fees, forfeited deposits and remaining payments due
    under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income.
    Other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or
    inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to
    shut down a facility. Asset impairment costs include the
    reduction in value of the Company’s assets as a result of
    the integration or restructuring activities. Other integration
    costs primarily include charges directly related to the
    integration plan such as consulting costs related to information
    systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and
    travel costs directly associated with the integration plan. See
    Note 3 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for additional information.

Vendor
    Reserves

The Company maintains reserves to cover areas of exposure with
    its vendors. In determining appropriate vendor reserves, the
    Company assesses historical experience and current outstanding
    claims. The Company has established various levels of reserves
    based on the type of claim and status of review. The Company
    researches and resolves various types of contested transactions
    based on discussions with vendors, Company policy and findings
    of research performed. Though the transaction types are
    relatively consistent, the Company has periodically refined its
    estimate methodology over the past few years by updating the
    reserve estimate percentages based upon historical experiences.
    Changes to the estimate percentages have resulted in a financial
    impact to the Company’s cost of products sold in the period
    in which the change was made.

Vendor reserves were $72.6 million and $112.4 million
    at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 61%
    and 73% of the vendor reserve at June 30, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, pertained to the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment. Fluctuations in the
    reserve balance are caused by the variations of outstanding
    claims from period to period, timing of settlements and specific
    vendor issues, such as bankruptcies (significant events would be
    described above in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations”). Though vendor transactions remain relatively
    consistent from period to period, unforeseen events such as the
    deterioration in the financial condition of a large vendor or a
    settlement of numerous outstanding claims could cause the
    reserve to fluctuate, and thus, have a financial impact on the
    period’s financial results.

At any given time, there are outstanding items in various stages
    of research and resolution. The ultimate outcome of certain
    claims may be different than the Company’s original
    estimate and may require adjustment. However, the Company
    believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based
    upon current facts and circumstances.

Self
    Insurance Accruals

The Company is self-insured for employee medical and dental
    insurance programs. The Company had recorded liabilities
    totaling $24.3 million and $24.1 million for estimated
    costs related to outstanding claims at June 30, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. These costs include an estimate for expected
    settlements on pending claims, administrative fees and an
    estimate for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates
    are based on the Company’s assessment of outstanding
    claims, historical analysis and current payment trends. The
    Company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not
    reported using an estimated lag period. This lag period
    assumption has been consistently applied for the periods
    presented. If the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a
    period equal to a half month, the impact on earnings would be
    $6.0 million. If the amount of claims, medical or dental
    costs increase beyond what was estimated, the reserve might not
    be sufficient and additional expense could be required. However,
    the Company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based
    upon current facts and circumstances.



Medical and dental insurance expense was $174.6 million,
    $140.5 million and $140.4 million in fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

Through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, the Company has
    certain deductibles or is self-insured for various risks
    including general liability, product liability, pharmacist
    professional liability, auto liability, property and
    workers’ compensation. However, claims in excess of certain
    limits are insured with commercial insurers. The Company had
    recorded liabilities totaling $82.2 million and
    $76.3 million for anticipated costs related to liability,
    property and workers’ compensation at June 30, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. These costs include an estimate for
    expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs, claims
    adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not
    reported. For certain types of exposures the Company uses third
    parties to assist in developing the estimate of expected
    ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific
    information related to each claim. For claims incurred but not
    reported the liabilities are calculated by outside actuaries and
    are derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial
    practices. The amount of ultimate liability in respect to these
    matters is dependent on future contingent events that cannot be
    predicted with certainty and may differ from these estimates.
    Although the Company believes that liability estimates are
    appropriate based on information available at June 30,
    2007, it is possible, based on generally accepted actuarial
    analysis, that under adverse conditions the ultimate liability
    could exceed recorded expected liabilities as of June 30,
    2007 by as much as $4.9 million. The insurance expense for
    general liability, product liability, pharmacist professional
    liability, auto liability, property and workers’
    compensation was $70.4 million, $71.3 million and
    $66.5 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The Company’s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities and income tax reserves reflect management’s
    assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the
    financial statements.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between
    financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and
    liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carry
    forwards for tax purposes. The Company had net deferred income
    tax assets of $394.2 million and $461.1 million at
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company also had
    net deferred income tax liabilities of $1.7 billion at
    June 30, 2007 and 2006. Net deferred income tax assets
    included net federal, state and local, and international loss
    and credit carry forwards at June 30, 2007 and 2006 of
    $178.2 million and $84.9 million, respectively. The
    Company established a net valuation allowance of
    $180.5 million and $34.4 million at June 30, 2007
    and 2006, respectively, against certain deferred tax assets,
    which primarily relates to federal and state loss carryforwards
    for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is
    uncertain. The Company established a $127.1 million
    valuation allowance in fiscal 2007 related to capital loss
    carryforwards resulting from the PTS Business divestiture for
    which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain.
    Expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are
    adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances
    described above, the Company anticipates no limitations will
    apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net
    deferred income tax assets described above.

In addition, the Company has established an estimated liability
    for federal, state and

non-U.S. income

tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under
    SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”
    The Company prepares and files tax returns based on its
    interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates
    based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal
    course of business, the Company’s tax returns are subject
    to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations
    may result in future tax and interest assessments by these
    taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of
    tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from
    legislation, regulation

and/or

as
    concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems.

The Company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax
    liability related to such matters and has consistently followed
    such methodology from period to period. The liability amounts
    for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying
    facts and circumstances, a thorough research of the technical
    merits of the Company’s arguments and an assessment of the
    probability of the Company prevailing in its arguments. In all
    cases, the Company considers previous findings of the Internal
    Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company
    generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its
    conclusions. Amounts accrued for a particular period are
    adjusted when a significant change in facts or circumstances has
    occurred.



The Company believes that its estimates for the valuation
    allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency
    reserves are appropriate based on current facts and
    circumstances. However, other people applying reasonable
    judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a
    different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon
    resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued.

In addition to income mix from geographical regions, the
    significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding
    paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective
    tax rate in each year. Although not material to the effective
    tax rate for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, if
    any of the Company’s assumptions or estimates were to
    change, an increase/decrease in the Company’s effective tax
    rate by 1% on earnings before income taxes and discontinued
    operations would have caused income tax expense to
    increase/decrease by $12.5 million for the fiscal year
    ended June 30, 2007.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company is required to
    adopt the provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes.” FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This standard also
    provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may
    be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount
    of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
    upon settlement. This interpretation also provides guidance on
    measurement, derecognizing, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
    FIN No. 48 on its consolidated financial statements.

Loss
    Contingencies

The Company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in
    accordance with SFAS No. 5, which requires the Company
    to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and
    range of possible settlement. An estimated loss contingency is
    accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
    if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
    amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated. Assessing
    contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about
    future events. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to
    determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures.
    The amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these
    estimates.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,”
    applying the modified prospective method. This Statement
    requires all equity-based payments to employees, including
    grants of options, to be recognized in the consolidated
    statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the
    award.

The fair values of options granted after the Company adopted
    this Statement were determined using a lattice valuation model
    and all options granted prior to adoption of this Statement were
    valued using a Black-Scholes model. The Company’s estimate
    of an option’s fair value is dependent on a complex
    estimation process that requires the estimation of future
    uncertain events. These estimates which are entered within the
    option valuation model include, but are not limited to, stock
    price volatility, the expected option life, expected dividend
    yield and option forfeiture rates. Effective with all options
    granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),
    the Company estimates its future stock price volatility based on
    implied volatility from traded options on the Company’s
    Common Shares and historical volatility over a period of time
    commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant
    (7 years). The Company analyzed historical data to estimate
    option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate
    the expected option life and forfeiture rates. The Company
    calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups
    of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors. Once
    employee stock option values are determined, current accounting
    practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the
    estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual
    results. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires the Company
    to compare its estimated option forfeiture rates to actual
    forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary. See
    Note 18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for additional information regarding
    equity-based compensation.

Net cash provided
    by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal
    2007 totaled $1.0 billion, a decrease of $847 million
    when compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease was a result of the
    decline in net income from continuing operations
    ($324 million) due to the litigation charges and cash
    settlements made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007
    ($655 million). See Note 12 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for information
    regarding the litigation settlements. The increase in trade
    receivables ($783 million) was based on the repurchase of
    trade receivables ($550 million) under the Company’s
    committed receivables program, as discussed in Note 19 of
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” In line
    with the Company’s focus on capital deployment, inventory
    levels declined $217 million and accounts payable increased
    $224 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing
    operations during fiscal 2006 totaled $1.9 billion, a
    decrease of $625 million when compared to fiscal 2005. The
    decrease was primarily a result of the net proceeds received
    during fiscal 2005 under the Company’s committed
    receivables sales facility program ($550 million). See
    Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for information regarding this program. During
    fiscal 2006, the accounts payable increase ($1.5 billion)
    was partially offset by increased inventories
    ($356 million) and increased accounts receivable
    ($895 million). The accounts payable, trade receivable and
    inventory increases were due to new sales volume from an
    existing large retail chain customer and the timing of inventory
    purchases from vendors in the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment.

Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued
    operations during fiscal 2007 totaled $220 million. Net
    cash provided by operating activities from discontinued
    operations in fiscal 2007 was a result of earnings from
    discontinued operations ($1.1 billion) less the gain on the
    sale of the PTS Business ($1.1 billion).

Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued
    operations during fiscal 2006 and 2005 totaled $271 million
    and $380 million, respectively. Net cash provided by
    discontinued operations in fiscal 2006 and 2005 was a result of
    the loss from discontinued operations ($163 million and
    $16 million, respectively), offset by the changes in the
    operating assets and liabilities from discontinued operations.

Investing activities

.

Net cash used by
    investing activities for continuing operations of
    $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 reflected cash used to
    complete acquisitions to broaden and enhance product offerings,
    including Viasys within the Medical Products Manufacturing
    segment, MedMined and Care Fusion within the Clinical
    Technologies and Services segment and SpecialtyScripts within
    the Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    segment. See “Acquisitions and Divestitures” within
    “Item 1 — Business” of this

Form 10-K

and Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for further information regarding the
    Company’s acquisitions. Proceeds from the sale of
    short-term investments classified as available for sale
    ($367 million) were offset by capital spending
    ($357 million) to develop and enhance the Company’s
    infrastructure including facilities, information systems and
    machinery and equipment. See Note 4 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for information
    regarding the Company’s investments.



Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations
    of $1.1 billion during fiscal 2006 reflected the
    Company’s purchase of short-term investments classified as
    available for sale ($399 million) and capital spending
    ($340 million). In addition, during fiscal 2006, the
    Company used cash to complete acquisitions ($362 million)
    which expand its role as a provider of services to the
    healthcare industry and are primarily associated with the
    acquisitions of Dohmen and ParMed within the Healthcare Supply
    Chain Services — Pharmaceutical segment, Denver
    Biomedical within the Medical Products Manufacturing segment and
    the remaining minority interest of Source Medical within the
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment.

Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations
    during fiscal 2005 of $694 million reflected the
    Company’s capital spending ($340 million), the
    acquisitions of Alaris and Geodax ($273 million) and the
    purchase of short-term investments classified as available for
    sale ($100 million).

Net cash provided by investing activities for discontinued
    operations in fiscal 2007 of $3.1 billion reflected
    proceeds from the PTS Business divestiture ($3.2 billion)
    offset by capital spending ($108 million). Net cash used in
    investing activities for discontinued operations in fiscal 2006
    and 2005 of $100 million and $182 million,
    respectively, primarily represents capital spending
    ($103 million and $214 million, respectively).

Financing activities

.

Net cash used in
    financing activities for continuing operations of
    $2.6 billion during fiscal 2007 reflected the
    Company’s repurchase of its Common Shares
    ($3.7 billion) and dividend payments to shareholders
    ($144 million). See “Share Repurchases” below for
    additional information. The Company also used cash to repay
    long-term obligations ($784 million). Cash provided by
    financing activities included proceeds received from the
    issuance of long-term obligations, net of issuance costs
    ($1.5 billion) and proceeds received from shares issued
    under various employee stock plans ($553 million). See
    “Capital Resources” below for further discussion of
    the Company’s financing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities for continuing operations
    of $1.0 billion during fiscal 2006 reflected the
    Company’s repurchase of its Common Shares
    ($1.5 billion) and dividend payments to shareholders
    ($102 million). The Company also used cash to purchase
    certain buildings and equipment which were under capital lease
    agreements ($258 million) reflected in the reduction of
    long-term obligations. Cash provided by financing activities
    includes proceeds received from the issuance of long-term
    obligations, net of issuance costs ($497 million) and
    proceeds received from shares issued under various employee
    stock plans ($241 million).

Net cash used in financing activities for continuing operations
    of $1.7 billion during fiscal 2005 reflected the
    Company’s decisions to retire debt ($1.9 billion) and
    commercial paper ($551 million) assumed in the Alaris
    acquisition. The Company also used cash to repurchase its Common
    Shares ($500 million) and pay dividends to shareholders
    ($52 million) as authorized by its Board of Directors. Cash
    provided by financing activities include proceeds received from
    the issuance of long-term obligations, net of issuance costs
    ($1.3 billion) and proceeds received from shares issued
    under various employee stock plans ($111 million).

Net cash used in financing activities for discontinued
    operations in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 reflected
    $39 million, $48 million and $22 million,
    respectively, in repayments on borrowings. Sources of cash for
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were additional borrowings of
    $4 million, $29 million and $17 million,
    respectively.

International
    Cash

The Company’s cash balance of approximately
    $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2007 included
    approximately $707 million of cash held by its subsidiaries
    outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash
    held outside the United States is available for repatriation,
    doing so subjects it to United States federal income tax. See
    Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for additional information regarding income
    taxes.

Share
    Repurchases

The Company repurchased approximately $5.8 billion of its
    Common Shares, in the aggregate, through share repurchase
    programs during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. During fiscal 2007,
    the Company repurchased $3.8 billion of its Common Shares
    under a $4.5 billion repurchase program or
    53.8 million shares at an average price per share of
    $69.79. This $4.5 billion repurchase program will expire on
    June 30, 2008. On August 8, 2007, the Company
    announced a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program which
    expires on August 31, 2009. The share repurchase activity
    (apart from the use of net proceeds from the PTS Business
    divestiture) supports the Company’s previously



stated long-term goal to return 50% of net cash provided by
    operating activities from continuing operations to shareholders.

During fiscal 2006 and 2005 the Company repurchased
    $1.5 billion and $500 million, respectively, of Common
    Shares. The Company’s fiscal 2006 and 2005 Common Share
    repurchases represent 22.0 million and 8.9 million
    shares at an average price per share of $68.39 and $56.76,
    respectively.

See “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” within
    “Item 5 — Market for Registrant’s
    Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
    of Equity Securities” for further information regarding the
    Company’s most recent share repurchase program.

Capital
    Resources

In addition to cash, the Company’s sources of liquidity
    include a $1.5 billion commercial paper program backed by a
    $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a committed
    receivables sales facility program with the capacity to sell
    $800 million in receivables.

The Company increased the commercial paper program from $1.0
    billion to $1.5 billion on February 28, 2007. The
    Company had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper
    program at June 30, 2007.

On January 24, 2007, the Company amended certain terms of
    the revolving credit facility which is available for general
    corporate purposes. As part of the amendment, the amount of the
    facility was increased from $1.0 billion to
    $1.5 billion and the term was extended to January 24,
    2012. At expiration, this facility can be extended upon mutual
    consent of the Company and the lending institutions. This
    revolving credit facility exists largely to support issuances of
    commercial paper as well as other short-term borrowings for
    general corporate purposes and remained unused at June 30,
    2007, except for $79 million of standby letters of credit
    issued on behalf of the Company.

During the second quarter, the Company repurchased the aggregate
    $550 million of receivable interests outstanding under its
    committed receivables sales facility program with the capacity
    to sell $800 million in receivables. After these
    repurchases, the Company did not have any receivable interest
    sales outstanding under its receivables sales facility program.
    On October 31, 2006, the Company renewed the receivables
    sales facility program for a period of one year. See
    Note 19 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for more information on the Company’s
    committed receivables sales facility program.

The Company also maintains other short-term credit facilities
    and an unsecured line of credit that allows for borrowings up to
    $131 million, of which $29 million was outstanding at
    June 30, 2007.

The Company entered into a $500 million short-term loan
    facility on March 30, 2007 and it was terminated on
    April 10, 2007. The Company also terminated a
    $150 million extendible commercial note program in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2007.

On October 3, 2006, the Company sold $350 million
    aggregate principal amount of 2009 floating rate notes and
    $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.80% notes
    due 2016 in a private offering. The proceeds of the debt
    issuance were used to repay $500 million of the
    Company’s preferred debt securities, $127 million of
    the 7.30% notes due 2006 and other short-term obligations
    of the Company.

On June 8, 2007, the Company sold $300 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5.65% notes due 2012 and
    $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% notes
    due 2017 in a private offering. The proceeds of the debt
    issuance were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of
    the Viasys acquisition and for general corporate purposes.

During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to
    periodically sell trade receivables to a special purpose
    accounts receivable and financing entity (the “Accounts
    Receivable and Financing Entity”), which is exclusively
    engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and making loans
    to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity,
    which is consolidated by the Company as it is the primary
    beneficiary of the variable interest entity, issued
    $250 million and $400 million in preferred variable
    debt securities to parties not affiliated with the Company
    during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively. On October 26,
    2006, the Company amended certain of the facility terms of the
    Company’s preferred debt securities. As part of this
    amendment, the Company



repaid $500 million of the principal balance with a portion
    of the proceeds of the October 2006 sale of notes discussed
    above and a minimum net worth covenant was added whereby the
    minimum net worth of the Company cannot fall below
    $5.0 billion at any time. The amendment eliminated a
    minimum adjusted tangible net worth covenant (adjusted tangible
    net worth could not fall below $2.5 billion) and certain
    financial ratio covenants. After the repayment, the Company had
    $150 million of preferred debt securities outstanding.
    These preferred debt securities are classified as long-term
    obligations, less current portion and other short-term
    obligations in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

See Notes 10 and 19 in “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for more information about the
    Company’s capital resources.

From time to time, the Company considers and engages in
    acquisition transactions in order to expand its role as a
    leading provider of products and services that improve the
    safety and productivity of healthcare. The Company evaluates
    possible candidates for merger or acquisition and considers
    opportunities to expand its role as a provider of products and
    services to the healthcare industry through all its reportable
    segments. If additional transactions are entered into or
    consummated, the Company may need to enter into funding
    arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions.

The Company currently believes that, based upon existing cash,
    operating cash flows, available capital resources (as discussed
    above) and other available market transactions, it has adequate
    capital resources at its disposal to fund currently anticipated
    capital expenditures, business growth and expansion, contractual
    obligations and current and projected debt service requirements,
    including those related to business combinations.

Debt
    Ratings/Covenants

The Company’s senior debt credit ratings from S&P,
    Moody’s and Fitch are BBB, Baa2 and BBB+, respectively, and
    the commercial paper ratings are

A-2,

P-2

and F2,
    respectively. The Moody’s and Fitch rating outlooks are
    “stable” and the S&P outlook is
    “positive.”

The Company’s various borrowing facilities and long-term
    debt are free of any financial covenants other than minimum net
    worth which cannot fall below $5.0 billion at any time. As
    of June 30, 2007, the Company was in compliance with this
    covenant. A breach of this covenant would be followed by a grace
    period during which the Company may discuss remedies with the
    security holders, or extinguish the securities, without causing
    an event of default.

Interest
    Rate and Currency Risk Management

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and interest
    rate swaps to manage its exposure to cash flow variability. The
    Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and
    interest rate swaps to protect the value of its existing foreign
    currency assets and liabilities and the value of its debt. See
    Notes 1 and 14 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for information regarding the use of financial
    instruments and derivatives, including foreign currency hedging
    instruments.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company is exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as
    a result of certain market risks. These market risks primarily
    relate to foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity related
    changes. The Company maintains a comprehensive hedging program
    to manage volatility related to these market exposures. It
    employs operational, economic, and derivative financial
    instruments in order to mitigate risk. See Notes 1 and 14
    of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
    further discussion regarding the Company’s use of
    derivative instruments.

Foreign
    Exchange Rate Sensitivity

By nature of the Company’s global operations, it is exposed
    to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign
    exchange rate variation. These exposures are transactional and
    translational in nature. Since the Company manufactures and
    sells its products throughout the world, its foreign currency
    risk is diversified. Principal drivers of this diversified
    foreign exchange exposure include the Canadian dollar, European
    euro, Mexican peso, Thai baht, British pound, and Australian
    dollar.

Transactional
    Exposure

The Company’s transactional exposure arises from the
    purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than
    the functional currency of the parent or its subsidiaries. As
    part of its risk management program, at the end of each fiscal
    year the Company performs a sensitivity analysis on its
    forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year.
    The analysis utilizes an implied volatility measurement for each
    currency to estimate the net potential gain or loss. The
    analysis included the estimated impact of its hedging program,
    which mitigates the Company’s transactional exposure. At
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company had hedged
    approximately 46% and 44%, respectively, of its transactional
    exposures. The following table summarizes the analysis as it
    relates to the Company’s transactional exposure (in
    millions):

22.2

Translational
    Exposure

The Company also has exposure related to the translation of
    financial statements of its foreign divisions into
    U.S. dollars, the functional currency of the parent. It
    performs a similar analysis as described above related to this
    translational exposure. The Company does not typically hedge any
    of its translational exposure and no hedging impact was included
    in the Company’s analysis at June 30, 2007 and 2006.
    The following table summarizes the Company’s translational
    exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10% strengthening or
    weakening in the U.S. dollar (in millions):



Net estimated translational
    exposure

$

89.0

$

93.0

Sensitivity gain/loss

8.9

9.3

Interest
    Rate Sensitivity

The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as
    a result of its borrowing and investing activities to maintain
    liquidity and fund business operations. The nature and amount of
    the Company’s long-term and short-term debt can be expected
    to fluctuate as a result of business requirements, market
    conditions and other factors. The Company’s policy is to
    manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and
    floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management. The
    Company utilizes interest rate swap instruments to mitigate its
    exposure to interest rate movements.



As part of its risk management program, the Company annually
    performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted exposure to
    interest rates for the following fiscal year. This analysis
    assumes a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates. At
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, the potential increase or decrease
    in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this
    hypothetical change was $9.4 million and $6.2 million,
    respectively.

Commodity
    Price Sensitivity

The Company purchases certain commodities for use in its
    manufacturing processes, which include latex, heating oil,
    diesel fuel and polystyrene, among others. The Company typically
    purchases these commodities at market prices, and as a result,
    is affected by price fluctuations. As part of its risk
    management program, the Company performs sensitivity analysis on
    its forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year.
    At June 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company had not hedged any
    of these exposures. The table below summarizes the
    Company’s analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures
    and a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices as of
    June 30, 2007 and 2006 (in millions):



Estimated commodity exposure

$

251.3

$

173.7

Sensitivity gain/loss

25.1

17.4

The Company also has exposure to certain energy related
    commodities, including natural gas and electricity through its
    normal course of business. These exposures result primarily from
    operating the Company’s distribution, manufacturing, and
    corporate facilities. In certain deregulated markets, the
    Company from time to time enters into long-term purchase
    contracts to supply these items at a specific price.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the

Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    June 30, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2).
    These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
    of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and the
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2007 and
    2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    June 30, 2007, in conformity with the U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” applying the modified
    prospective method at the beginning of fiscal year 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated August 22, 2007 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cardinal Health, Inc. is an Ohio corporation formed in 1979.
    Cardinal Health, Inc. is a leading provider of products and
    services that improve the safety and productivity of healthcare.
    References to the “Company” in these consolidated
    financial statements shall be deemed to be references to
    Cardinal Health, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries unless
    the context otherwise requires.

The Company changed its reportable segments beginning with the
    first quarter of fiscal 2007. As of June 30, 2006, the
    Company conducted its business within the following four
    reportable segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider
    Services; Medical Products and Services; Pharmaceutical
    Technologies and Services; and Clinical Technologies and
    Services. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the
    Company began reporting its financial information within the
    following five reportable segments: Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical; Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical; Clinical Technologies and
    Services; Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services; and Medical
    Products Manufacturing.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company committed
    to plans to sell the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services
    segment, other than certain generic-focused businesses (the
    segment, excluding the certain generic-focused businesses that
    were not sold, is referred to as the “PTS Business”).
    The Company completed the sale of the PTS Business during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The following is an explanation
    of the fiscal 2007 changes, if any, from the Company’s
    reportable segments as of June 30, 2006:

Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Pharmaceutical.

The Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment encompasses the
    businesses previously within the former Pharmaceutical
    Distribution and Provider Services segment, in addition to the
    nuclear pharmacy, third-party logistics support and certain
    generic-focused businesses previously within the former
    Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment and the
    therapeutic plasma distribution capabilities previously within
    the former Medical Products and Services segment.

Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical.

The Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical segment encompasses the
    Company’s medical products distribution business and the
    assembly of sterile and non-sterile procedure kits previously
    within the former Medical Products and Services segment.

Clinical Technologies and Services.

There were
    no changes to the Clinical Technologies and Services segment.

Medical Products Manufacturing.

The Medical
    Products Manufacturing segment encompasses the medical and
    surgical products manufacturing businesses previously within the
    former Medical Products and Services segment.

Basis of Presentation.

The consolidated
    financial statements of the Company include the accounts of all
    majority-owned subsidiaries, and all significant inter-company
    amounts have been eliminated.

During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company completed several
    acquisitions that were accounted for under the purchase method
    of accounting. The consolidated financial statements include the
    results of operations from each of these business combinations
    as of the date of acquisition. Additional disclosure related to
    the Company’s acquisitions is provided in Note 2.

Effective the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company
    reclassified the PTS Business to discontinued operations.
    Effective the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
    reclassified a significant portion of its healthcare marketing
    services business (“HMS Disposal Group”) and its
    United Kingdom-based Intercare pharmaceutical distribution
    business (“IPD”) to discontinued operations. In
    addition, effective the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the
    Company reclassified its sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing
    business in Humacao, Puerto Rico (“Humacao”) to



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

discontinued operations. Prior period financial results were
    reclassified to conform to these changes in presentation. See
    Note 8 for additional information regarding discontinued
    operations.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company changed
    the classification of certain immaterial implementation costs
    associated with the sale of medical and supply storage devices
    in the Clinical Technologies and Services segment from selling,
    general and administrative expenses to cost of products sold.
    Prior period financial results were reclassified to conform to
    these changes in presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in
    the United States requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates
    include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful
    accounts, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible asset
    impairment, preliminary purchase accounting allocations
    including acquired in-process research and development costs
    (“IPR&D”), vendor reserves, equity-based
    compensation, income taxes, loss contingencies and restructuring
    charge reserves. Actual amounts may differ from these estimated
    amounts.

Cash Equivalents.

The Company considers all
    liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or
    less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these cash
    equivalents approximates fair value.

Short-term Investments.

The Company’s
    short-term investments at June 30, 2007 included
    $132.0 million in tax exempt auction rate securities. At
    June 30, 2006, the Company’s short-term investments
    included $208.9 million in tax exempt variable rate demand
    notes and $289.5 million in tax exempt auction rate
    securities. These short-term investments are classified as
    available-for-sale on the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet. The Company’s investments in these securities are
    recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value due to
    their variable interest rates. See Note 4 for additional
    information regarding short-term investments.

Receivables.

Trade receivables are primarily
    comprised of amounts owed to the Company through its
    distribution businesses within the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical segments and are presented net of
    an allowance for doubtful accounts. See Note 5 for
    additional information.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major
    Customers.

The Company maintains cash depository
    accounts with major banks throughout the world and invests in
    high quality short-term liquid instruments. Such investments are
    made only in instruments issued or enhanced by high quality
    institutions. These investments mature within three months and
    the Company has not incurred any related losses.

The Company’s trade receivables, lease receivables, and
    finance notes and accrued interest receivables are exposed to a
    concentration of credit risk with customers in the retail and
    healthcare sectors. Credit risk can be affected by changes in
    reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the
    hospital and acute care sectors of the healthcare industry.
    However, such credit risk is limited due to supporting
    collateral and the diversity of the customer base, including its
    wide geographic dispersion. The Company performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and
    maintains reserves for credit losses. Such losses historically
    have been within the Company’s expectations.

The following table summarizes all of the Company’s
    customers which individually account for at least 10% of the
    Company’s revenue. The customers in the table below are
    serviced through the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment.

CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At June 30, 2007 and 2006, CVS accounted for 20% and 27%,
    respectively, and Walgreens accounted for 27% and 28%,
    respectively, of the Company’s gross trade receivable
    balance.

Certain of the Company’s businesses have entered into
    agreements with group purchasing organizations
    (“GPOs”) which act as purchasing agents that negotiate
    vendor contracts on behalf of their members. In fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, approximately 10%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of
    revenue was derived from GPO members through the contractual
    arrangements established with Novation, LLC and Premier
    Purchasing Partners, L.P., the Company’s two largest GPO
    relationships in terms of revenue. However, the Company’s
    trade receivable balances are with individual members of the GPO
    and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists
    with these types of arrangements.

Inventories.

A substantial portion of
    inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method, or market. The remaining
    inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost, using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method, or market. See Note 7
    for additional information.

Cash Discounts.

Manufacturer cash discounts
    are recorded as a component of inventory cost and recognized as
    a reduction of cost of products sold when the related inventory
    is sold.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment
    are primarily stated at cost. Depreciation expense for financial
    reporting purposes is primarily computed using the straight-line
    method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, including
    capital lease assets which are depreciated over the terms of
    their respective leases. The Company uses the following range of
    useful lives for its property and equipment categories:
    buildings and improvements — 1 to 50 years;
    machinery and equipment — 2 to 20 years;
    furniture and fixtures — 3 to 10 years.
    Depreciation expense was $252.2 million,
    $238.7 million and $239.7 million for fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company expenses repairs and
    maintenance expenditures as incurred. Repairs and maintenance
    expense was $61.3 million, $52.2 million and
    $46.5 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    The Company capitalizes interest on long-term fixed asset
    projects using a rate of 5.9%, which approximates the
    Company’s weighted average interest rate on long-term
    obligations. The amount of capitalized interest was immaterial
    for all fiscal years presented.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles.

The Company
    accounts for purchased goodwill and other intangible assets in
    accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS No. 142, purchased
    goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least
    annually. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily
    customer relationships, patents and trademarks, continue to be
    amortized over their useful lives. SFAS No. 142
    requires that impairment testing be conducted at the reporting
    unit level, which can be at the operating segment level as
    defined by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” or one
    level below the operating segment. The Company has determined
    the reporting unit used for impairment assessment should be the
    operating segment level as the business units comprising the
    operating segments service a common group of customers, offer
    complementary products, and share a common strategy. In
    conducting the impairment test, the fair value of each of the
    Company’s reporting units is compared to their respective
    carrying amounts including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds
    the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying
    amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to
    assess impairment.

The Company’s determination of fair value of the reporting
    units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis or a review of
    the price/earnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar
    in nature, scope and size. The methods and assumptions used to
    test impairment have been revised for the segment realignment
    for the periods presented. The discount rate used for impairment
    testing is based on the risk-free rate plus an adjustment for
    risk factors. The use of alternative estimates, peer groups or
    changes in the industry, or adjusting the discount rate could
    affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units and
    potentially result in impairment. Any identified impairment
    would result in an adjustment to the Company’s results of
    operations. The Company performed its annual impairment test in
    fiscal



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2007 and 2006, neither of which resulted in the recognition of
    impairment charges. See Note 9 for additional information
    regarding goodwill and other intangible assets.

Income Taxes.

In accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes,” the Company accounts for income taxes using
    the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method
    requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that
    currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases
    of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in
    the respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In
    assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the
    Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some
    portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
    Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of
    subsidiaries outside of the U.S. when it is expected that
    these earnings are permanently reinvested.

The Company repatriated $494.0 million of accumulated
    foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation
    provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
    “AJCA”) and had a total liability of
    $26.7 million at June 30, 2006. The maximum
    repatriation available to the Company under the repatriation
    provisions of the AJCA was $500.0 million. See Note 11
    for additional information.

Accounting for Vendor Reserves.

In the
    ordinary course of business, vendors may challenge deductions or
    billings taken against payments otherwise due to them from the
    Company. These contested transactions are researched and
    resolved based upon Company policy and findings of the research
    performed. At any given time, there are outstanding items in
    various stages of research and resolution. In determining an
    appropriate vendor reserve, the Company assesses historical
    information and current outstanding claims. The ultimate outcome
    of certain claims may be different than the Company’s
    original estimate and may require adjustment. All adjustments to
    vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold.

Other Accrued Liabilities.

Other accrued
    liabilities represent various obligations of the Company
    including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payable.
    For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, the
    largest component of other accrued liabilities were net current
    deferred tax liabilities of approximately $650.0 million
    and $606.9 million, respectively. Other significant
    components of other accrued liabilities were current income
    taxes payable and employee compensation and related benefit
    accruals. For fiscal 2007 and 2006, current income taxes payable
    were $119.7 million and $222.8 million, respectively,
    while employee compensation and related benefit accruals were
    $377.5 million and $323.5 million, respectively.

Equity-Based Compensation.

During the first
    quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,”
    applying the modified prospective method. This Statement
    requires all equity-based payments to employees, including
    grants of options, to be recognized in the consolidated
    statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the
    award. The fair values of options granted after the Company
    adopted this Statement were determined using a lattice valuation
    model and all options granted prior to adoption of this
    Statement were valued using a Black-Scholes model. The
    Company’s estimate of an option’s fair value is
    dependent on a complex estimation process that requires the
    estimation of future uncertain events. These estimates include,
    but are not limited to, stock price volatility, the expected
    option life, expected dividend yield and option forfeiture rates.

The compensation expense recognized for all equity-based awards
    is net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized using the
    straight-line method over the awards’ service period. The
    Company classifies equity-based compensation within selling,
    general and administrative expenses to correspond with the same
    line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to
    employees. See Note 18 for additional information regarding
    equity-based compensation.

Dividends.

The Company paid cash dividends per
    Common Share of $0.36, $0.24 and $0.12 for the fiscal years
    ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition.

In accordance with
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
    Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,
    “Revenue Recognition,” the Company recognizes revenue
    when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product
    delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the
    price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Revenue is recognized net of sales returns and
    allowances.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical

This segment records distribution revenue when title transfers
    to its customers and the business has no further obligation to
    provide services related to such merchandise. This revenue is
    recorded net of sales returns and allowances.

Revenue within this segment includes revenue from bulk
    customers. Most deliveries to bulk customers consist of product
    shipped in the same form as the product is received from the
    manufacturer. Bulk customers have the ability to process large
    quantities of products in central locations and self distribute
    these products to their individual retail stores or customers.
    Revenue from bulk customers is recorded when title transfers to
    the customers and the Company has no further obligation to
    provide services related to such merchandise.

Revenue for deliveries that are direct shipped to customer
    warehouses from the manufacturer whereby the Company acts as an
    intermediary in the ordering and delivery of products is
    recorded gross in accordance with FASB Emerging Issues Task
    Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 99-19,

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent.” This revenue is recorded on a gross basis since the
    Company incurs credit risk from the customer, bears the risk of
    loss for incomplete shipments and does not receive a separate
    fee or commission for the transaction.

Radiopharmaceutical revenue is recognized upon delivery of the
    product to the customer. Service-related revenue, including fees
    received for analytical services or sales and marketing
    services, is recognized upon the completion of such services.

Through its Medicine Shoppe International, Inc. and Medicap
    Pharmacies Incorporated franchise operations (collectively,
    “Medicine Shoppe”), the Company has apothecary-style
    pharmacy franchisees in which it earns franchise and origination
    fees. Franchise fees represent monthly fees based upon
    franchisees’ sales and are recognized as revenue when they
    are earned. Origination fees from signing new franchise
    agreements are recognized as revenue when the new franchise
    store is opened.

Healthcare
    Supply Chain Services — Medical

This segment recognizes distribution revenue when title
    transfers to its customers and the business has no further
    obligation to provide services related to such merchandise. This
    revenue is recorded net of sales returns and allowances.

Clinical
    Technologies and Services

Leasing revenue is accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.”
    Revenue is recognized on sales-type leases when the lease
    becomes noncancellable. The lease is determined to be
    noncancellable upon completion of the installation, when the
    equipment is functioning according to material specifications of
    the user’s manual and the customer has accepted the
    equipment, as evidenced by signing an equipment confirmation
    document. Interest income on sales-type leases is recognized in
    revenue using the interest method.

Consistent with sales-type leases, revenue is recognized on
    operating leases after installation is complete and customer
    acceptance has occurred. Operating lease revenue is recognized
    over the lease term as such amounts become receivable according
    to the provisions of the lease.

Revenue for safety systems which contain software essential to
    the functionality of the product are subject to the provisions
    of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants

“Software Revenue Recognition.” The elements of safety
    system sales arrangements may contain some or all of the
    following: infusion devices, disposables, hardware, software,
    software maintenance programs and professional services. As a
    multiple element arrangement, total fees are allocated to each
    element based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value for each element or using the residual method, when
    applicable. Vendor-specific objective evidence is generally
    based on the price charged when an element is sold separately.
    Allocated fees are recognized separately for each element when
    it is delivered and there are no further contractual obligations
    with relation to that element. Perpetual software license
    revenue is generally recognized upon shipment to the customer.
    Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the
    contract period. Vendor-specific objective evidence for software
    maintenance is determined based on contract renewal price for
    such maintenance. Rights to unspecified software upgrades (on a

when-and-if

available basis) are included in software maintenance.
    Professional service revenue is recognized when services are
    rendered. Revenues are recognized net of sales returns and
    allowances.

Pharmacy management and other service revenue is recognized as
    the services are rendered according to the contracts
    established. A fee is charged under such contracts through a
    capitated fee, a dispensing fee, a monthly management fee or an
    actual costs-incurred arrangement. Under certain contracts, fees
    for services are guaranteed by the Company not to exceed
    stipulated amounts or have other risk-sharing provisions.
    Revenue is adjusted to reflect the estimated effects of such
    contractual guarantees and risk-sharing provisions.

Medical
    Products Manufacturing

This segment records self-manufactured medical product revenue
    when title transfers to its customers which generally occurs
    upon delivery. Revenues are recorded net of sales returns and
    allowances.

Multiple
    Segments or Business Units

Arrangements involving multiple segments or business units,
    containing no software or software which is incidental to the
    functionality of the product or service, and those arrangements
    involving a single segment or business unit and multiple
    deliverables are accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue

No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” If
    the deliverable meets the criteria of a separate unit of
    accounting, the arrangement revenue is allocated to each element
    based upon its relative fair value and recognized in accordance
    with the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each
    element.

Savings
    Guarantees

Some of the Company’s customer contracts include a
    guarantee of a certain amount of savings through utilization of
    the Company’s services. Revenue associated with a guarantee
    in which the form of consideration is cash or credit memos is
    not recorded until the guaranteed savings are fully recognized.
    For guarantees with consideration paid in the form of free
    products or services, the cost of products sold related to those
    sales is increased by the amount of the guarantee.

Sales Returns and Allowances.

Revenue is
    recorded net of sales returns and allowances. The Company
    recognizes sales returns as a reduction of revenue and cost of
    products sold for the sales price and cost, respectively, when
    products are returned. The customer return policies generally
    require that the product be physically returned, subject to
    restocking fees, and only allow customers to return products
    that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or
    that can be returned to vendors for credit. Product returns are
    generally consistent throughout the year, and typically are not
    specific to any particular product or customer. Amounts recorded
    in revenue and cost of products sold under this accounting
    policy closely approximate what would have been recorded under
    SFAS No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists.” Applying the provisions of
    SFAS No. 48 would not materially change the
    Company’s financial position and results of operations.
    Sales returns and allowances were approximately
    $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.5 billion in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Distribution Service Agreement and Other Vendor
    Fees.

The Company’s pharmaceutical supply
    chain business within the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment accounts for fees
    received from its distribution service agreements and other fees
    received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of
    the vendor’s inventory as a reduction in cost of products
    sold, in accordance with EITF Issue

No. 02-16,

“Accounting by a Customer for Certain Consideration
    Received from a Vendor.”

Shipping and Handling.

Shipping and handling
    costs are included in selling, general and administrative
    expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Shipping
    and handling costs include all delivery expenses as well as all
    costs to prepare the product for shipment to the end customer.
    Shipping and handling costs totaled $305.8 million,
    $274.3 million and $275.7 million for fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Shipping and handling revenue
    received was immaterial for all periods presented.

Research and Development Costs.

Costs incurred
    in connection with development of new products and manufacturing
    methods are charged to expense as incurred. Research and
    development expenses were $102.8 million,
    $96.8 million and $87.2 million for fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

Translation of Foreign Currencies.

Financial
    statements of the Company’s subsidiaries outside the
    U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the
    functional currency. Adjustments to translate the assets and
    liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars
    are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’
    equity utilizing period-end exchange rates, net of tax. Foreign
    currency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing
    weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in
    the consolidated statements of earnings in interest expense and
    other and were immaterial for the fiscal years ended
    June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Interest Rate and Currency Risk
    Management.

The Company accounts for derivative
    instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as
    amended, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activity.” Under this standard, all derivative instruments
    are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and all changes
    in fair value are recorded to net earnings or shareholders’
    equity through other comprehensive income, net of tax.

The Company uses forward currency exchange contracts and
    interest rate swaps to manage its exposures to the variability
    of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate
    changes of future foreign currency transaction costs and to the
    interest rate changes on borrowing costs. These contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges.

The Company also uses interest rate swaps to hedge changes in
    the value of fixed rate debt due to variations in interest
    rates. Both the derivative instruments and underlying debt are
    adjusted to market value through interest expense and other at
    the end of each period. The Company uses foreign currency
    forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign
    currency assets and liabilities. The remeasurement adjustments
    for any foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities are
    included in interest expense and other. The remeasurement
    adjustment is offset by the foreign currency forward contract
    settlements which are also classified in interest expense and
    other. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value
    hedges.

The Company’s derivative contracts are adjusted to current
    market values each period and qualify for hedge accounting under
    SFAS No. 133, as amended. Periodic gains and losses of
    contracts designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in other
    comprehensive income until the underlying transactions are
    recognized. Upon recognition, such gains and losses are recorded
    in net earnings as an adjustment to the carrying amounts of
    underlying transactions in the period in which these
    transactions are recognized. For those contracts designated as
    fair value hedges, resulting gains or losses are recognized in
    net earnings offsetting the exposures of underlying
    transactions. Carrying values of all contracts are included in
    other assets or liabilities.

The Company’s policy requires that contracts used as hedges
    must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the
    exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the
    inception of the contract. Hedging effectiveness is assessed
    periodically. Any contract not designated as a hedge, or so
    designated but ineffective, is adjusted to market value and
    recognized in net earnings immediately. If a fair value or cash
    flow hedge ceases to

    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

qualify for hedge accounting or is terminated, the contract
    would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value
    until settled and future adjustments to the contract’s fair
    value would be recognized in earnings immediately. If a
    forecasted transaction was no longer probable to occur, amounts
    previously deferred in other comprehensive income would be
    recognized immediately in earnings. Additional disclosure
    related to the Company’s hedging contracts is provided in
    Note 14.

Earnings per Common Share.

Basic earnings per
    Common Share (“Basic EPS”) is computed by dividing net
    earnings (the numerator) by the weighted average number of
    Common Shares outstanding during each period (the denominator).
    Diluted earnings per Common Share is similar to the computation
    for Basic EPS, except that the denominator is increased by the
    dilutive effect of stock options, restricted shares and
    restricted share units computed using the treasury stock method.

Recent Financial Accounting Standards.

In
    February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments”
    an amendment of SFAS No. 133 and
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities.” This Statement permits fair value
    remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains
    an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be
    bifurcated from its host contract. The election to measure a
    hybrid financial instrument at fair value, in its entirety, is
    irrevocable and all changes in fair value are to be recognized
    in earnings. This Statement also clarifies and amends certain
    provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140.
    This Statement is effective for all of the Company’s
    financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a
    remeasurement event on or after July 1, 2007. The adoption
    of this Statement is not expected to have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes.” This Interpretation prescribes a
    comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition,
    measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
    This Interpretation is effective for the Company at July 1,
    2007. The cumulative effects, if any, of applying this
    Interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained
    earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The
    Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this
    Interpretation.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” This Statement defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
    Statement is effective for the Company on July 1, 2008, and
    interim periods within fiscal 2009. The Company is in the
    process of determining the impact of adopting this Statement.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” This
    Statement requires an entity to recognize in its statement of
    financial position an asset for a defined benefit postretirement
    plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s
    underfunded status, measure a defined benefit postretirement
    plan’s assets and obligations that determine its funded
    status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year, and
    recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit
    postretirement plan in comprehensive income in the year in which
    the changes occur. This Statement requires balance sheet
    recognition of the funded status for all pension and
    postretirement benefit plans effective for fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2006. This Statement also requires plan
    assets and benefit obligations to be measured as of a
    Company’s balance sheet date effective for fiscal years
    ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this
    Statement in fiscal 2007 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements.” This Bulletin addresses quantifying the
    financial statement effects of misstatements, including how the
    effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in
    quantifying misstatements in the current year financial
    statements. This Bulletin is effective for fiscal years ending
    after November 15, 2006 and allows for a one-time
    transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained

    previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance
    in SAB No. 108. The adoption of this Bulletin did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial position
    or results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Liabilities — including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This Statement creates a fair value option
    under which an entity may irrevocably elect fair value as the
    initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain assets
    and liabilities, on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument,
    all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument shall
    be reported in earnings. The Statement is effective for the
    Company on July 1, 2008. The Company is in the process of
    determining the impact, if any, of adopting this Statement.

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

Fiscal 2007.

On June 21 and 27, 2007, the
    Company completed the initial and subsequent tender offers for
    the outstanding common stock of Viasys, a Conshohocken,
    Pennsylvania-based provider of products and services directed at
    the critical care ventilation, respiratory diagnostics and
    clinical services, neurological, vascular, audio, homecare,
    orthopedics, sleep diagnostics and other medical and surgical
    products markets. Through the tender offers, a total of
    approximately 29.3 million shares of Viasys common stock
    were validly tendered for $42.75 per share, which represented
    approximately 88% of all outstanding shares of Viasys. On
    June 28, 2007, the Company acquired from Viasys a number of
    additional shares so that it would hold more than 90% of the
    outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. The same day,
    Viasys merged with a subsidiary of the Company to complete the
    transaction.

The cash transaction was valued at approximately
    $1.5 billion, including the assumption of approximately
    $54.2 million of debt. Viasys employees with outstanding
    stock options elected to either receive a cash payment or
    convert their options into options to purchase the
    Company’s Common Shares. Certain Viasys employees elected
    to convert their options, which resulted in those employees
    receiving the right to purchase a total of approximately
    0.1 million Common Shares of the Company.

The preliminary valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities
    resulted in goodwill of approximately $1.0 billion and
    identifiable intangible assets of $442.0 million. The
    Company valued intangible assets related to trade names, patents
    and customer relationships. The valuation is not yet finalized
    and subject to adjustment as the Company assesses the value of
    the pre-acquisition contingencies and certain other matters. The

During fiscal 2007, the Company recorded a charge of
    $83.9 million related to the write-off of IPR&D costs
    associated with the Viasys acquisition. The portion of the
    purchase price allocated to IPR&D was determined by an
    independent third-party appraisal and represents the estimated
    fair value of the research and development projects in-process
    at the time of the acquisition. These projects had not yet
    reached technological feasibility, were deemed to have no
    alternative use and, accordingly, were immediately charged to
    special items expense at the acquisition date in accordance with
    FIN No. 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement
    No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the
    Purchase Method.”

    aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions, which was paid
    in cash, was approximately $173.8 million with potential
    maximum contingent payments of $52.3 million. Assumed
    liabilities of these acquired businesses were approximately
    $22.4 million. The consolidated financial statements
    include the results of operations from each of these business
    combinations from the date of acquisition. Had the transactions,
    including Viasys, occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2006,

Fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 2005, the Company
    completed acquisitions that individually were not significant.
    The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions, which was
    paid in cash, was approximately $107.0 million. Assumed
    liabilities of these acquired businesses were approximately
    $27.0 million. The consolidated financial statements

Purchase
    Accounting Accruals

In connection with restructuring and integration plans related
    to its acquisition of Viasys, the Company accrued, as part of
    its acquisition adjustments, a liability of $21.7 million
    related to employee termination and relocation costs and
    $6.4 million related to closing of certain facilities. No
    payments were made in connection with the employee related costs
    or facility closures during fiscal 2007.

In connection with restructuring and integration plans related
    to Syncor, the Company accrued, as part of its acquisition
    adjustments, a liability of $15.1 million related to
    employee termination and relocation costs and $10.4 million
    related to closing of duplicate facilities. As of June 30,
    2007, the Company had paid $14.2 million of employee
    related costs, $8.7 million associated with the facility
    closures and $1.0 million of other restructuring charges.

SPECIAL
    ITEMS AND IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER

Special
    Items Policy

The Company records restructuring charges, acquisition
    integration charges and certain litigation and other items as
    special items. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the
    Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing
    facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing
    the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also
    involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of
    a business unit in response to changing market conditions.
    Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
    with Exit or Disposal Activities.” Under this Statement, a
    liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as
    incurred.

Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate
    acquired companies. Upon acquisition, certain integration
    charges are included within the purchase price allocation in
    accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations,” and other integration charges are recorded
    as special items as incurred.

Certain litigation recorded in special items consists of
    settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent,
    non-recurring or unusual in nature. The Company also classified
    legal fees and document preservation and

Restructuring
    Charges

During fiscal 2005, the Company launched a global restructuring
    program with a goal of increasing the value the Company provides
    its customers through better integration of existing businesses
    and improved efficiency from a more disciplined approach to
    procurement and resource allocation. The Company expects the
    program to be implemented in three phases and be substantially
    completed by the end of fiscal 2009.

The first phase of the program, announced in December 2004,
    focuses on business consolidations and process improvements,
    including rationalizing facilities worldwide, reducing the
    Company’s global workforce, and rationalizing and
    discontinuing overlapping and under-performing product lines.
    The second phase of the program, announced in August 2005,
    focuses on longer-term integration activities that will enhance
    service to customers through improved integration across the
    Company’s segments and continued streamlining of internal
    operations. The third phase of the program, announced in April
    2007, focuses on moving the headquarters of the Company’s
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment and
    certain corporate functions from Waukegan, Illinois to the
    Company’s corporate headquarters in Dublin, Ohio.

In addition to the global restructuring program, from time to
    time the Company incurs costs to implement smaller restructuring
    efforts for specific operations within its segments. The
    restructuring plans focus on various aspects of operations,
    including closing and consolidating certain manufacturing
    operations, rationalizing headcount, and aligning operations in
    the most strategic and cost-efficient structure.

    upon either communication of terms to employees or
    management’s commitment to the restructuring plan when a
    defined severance plan exists. Outplacement services provided to
    employees who have been involuntarily terminated and duplicate
    payroll costs during transition periods are also included within
    this classification.

Facility exit and other costs consist of accelerated
    depreciation, equipment relocation costs, project consulting
    fees and costs associated with restructuring the Company’s
    delivery of information technology infrastructure services.

The costs incurred within the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment for fiscal 2007 of
    $1.3 million primarily related to the reorganization of
    business units within the segment to evolve customer offerings
    and further differentiate the business from competitors. The
    costs incurred for fiscal 2006 and 2005 of $3.4 million and
    $12.5 million, respectively, primarily related to the
    closing of distribution centers and

consolidation into existing locations, the closing of multiple
    Company-owned pharmacies within Medicine Shoppe, the closure of
    facilities that were acquired as part of Syncor International
    Corporation (“Syncor”) and the outsourcing of
    information technology functions.

The costs incurred within the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical segment for fiscal 2007 of
    $9.2 million primarily related to the relocation of the
    segment’s headquarters to the Company’s corporate
    headquarters and the reorganization of business units within the
    segment to evolve customer offerings and further differentiate
    the business from competitors. The costs incurred for fiscal
    2006 and 2005 of $1.6 million and $3.7 million,
    respectively, primarily related to the centralization of
    management functions and consolidation of facilities within the
    distribution business and transitioning to a customer
    needs-based sales representative model in the ambulatory care
    business.

The costs incurred within the Clinical Technologies and Services
    segment for fiscal 2007 of $5.2 million primarily related
    to the closure of a facility. Costs incurred for the fiscal 2005
    of $1.3 million related to headcount reductions and the
    discontinuation of certain operations.

The costs incurred within the Medical Products Manufacturing
    segment for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 of $4.3 million,
    $9.1 million and $31.8 million, respectively,
    primarily related to projects aimed at improvements in
    manufacturing cost and efficiency through consolidation of
    facilities and outsourcing of production from higher cost
    platforms to lower cost platforms. In addition, costs were
    incurred during 2005 related to headcount reductions and moving
    operations internationally.

The costs incurred related to projects that impacted multiple
    segments during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, of
    $20.1 million, $33.5 million and $31.0 million,
    respectively, primarily related to design and implementation of
    the Company’s restructuring plans for certain
    administrative functions and restructuring the Company’s
    delivery of information technology infrastructure services. In
    addition, costs were incurred during fiscal 2007 related to
    restructuring and outsourcing certain human resource functions
    and during fiscal 2006 and 2005 related to consolidation of
    existing customer service operations into two locations.

Acquisition
    Integration Charges

Costs of integrating operations of various acquired companies
    are recorded as acquisition integration charges when incurred.
    The acquisition integration charges incurred during fiscal 2007
    were primarily a result of the Viasys acquisition and the costs
    incurred during fiscal 2006 and 2005 were primarily a result of
    the ALARIS Medical Systems, Inc. (“Alaris”) and Syncor
    acquisitions. During the fiscal years noted above, the Company
    also incurred acquisition integration charges for numerous
    smaller acquisitions. The following table and paragraphs provide
    additional detail regarding the types of acquisition integration

Employee-Related Costs.

During fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, the Company incurred employee-related costs
    associated with integrating acquired companies of
    $1.9 million, $9.1 million and $18.8 million,
    respectively. These costs primarily consist of severance, stay
    bonuses, non-compete agreements and other forms of compensatory
    payouts made to employees as a direct result of the
    acquisitions. The fiscal 2007 costs primarily related to the
    acquisition of the wholesale pharmaceutical, health and beauty
    and related drug store products distribution business of the F.
    Dohmen Co. and certain of its subsidiaries (“Dohmen”).
    The fiscal 2006 charges primarily related to the Alaris
    acquisition. The fiscal 2005 charges primarily related to the
    Alaris and Syncor acquisitions.

Asset Impairments and Other Exit Costs.

During
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company incurred asset
    impairment and other exit costs of $1.5 million,
    $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The asset
    impairment and other exit costs incurred during fiscal 2007 and
    2006 were primarily a result of facility integration plans for
    the Alaris acquisition. The asset impairment and other exit
    costs incurred during fiscal 2005 were primarily a result of
    fixed asset disposals due to the Alaris acquisition and facility
    closures associated with the Syncor acquisition.

IPR&D Costs.

During fiscal 2007, the
    Company recorded charges of $83.9 million and
    $0.6 million related to the write-off of IPR&D costs
    associated with Viasys and Care Fusion Incorporated (“Care
    Fusion”), respectively. The portion of the purchase price
    allocated to IPR&D was determined by an independent
    third-party appraisal and represented the estimated fair value
    of the research and development projects in-process at the time
    of the acquisition. These projects had not yet reached
    technological feasibility, were deemed to have no alternative
    use and, accordingly, were immediately charged to special items
    expense at the acquisition date in accordance with
    FIN No. 4.

Other Integration Costs.

During fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, the Company incurred integration costs and other
    of $13.6 million, $14.8 million and
    $19.4 million, respectively. The costs included in this
    category generally relate to expenses incurred to integrate
    acquired companies’ operations and systems into the
    Company’s pre-existing operations and systems. These costs
    include, but are not limited to, the integration of information
    systems, employee benefits and compensation, accounting/finance,
    tax, treasury, internal audit, risk management, compliance,
    administrative services, sales and marketing and other. The
    costs for fiscal 2007 primarily relate to the acquisitions of
    Dohmen and Alaris. The costs for fiscal 2006 and 2005 primarily
    relate to the acquisitions of Alaris and Syncor.

Debt Issuance Cost Write-Off.

During the first
    two quarters of fiscal 2005, the Company incurred charges of
    $8.8 million related to the write-off of debt issuance
    costs and other debt tender offer costs related to the
    Company’s decision to retire certain Alaris debt
    instruments that carried higher interest rates than the
    Company’s cost of debt. As a result, the Company retired
    such debt instruments in advance of their original maturity

    Litigation.

The Company recorded income of
    $28.5 million, $25.5 million and $41.7 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, resulting from
    settlement of antitrust claims alleging certain prescription
    drug manufacturers took improper actions to delay or prevent
    generic drug competition. The Company has not been a named
    plaintiff in any of these class actions, but has been a member
    of the direct purchasers’ class (i.e., those purchasers who
    purchase directly from these drug manufacturers). The total
    recovery of such claims through June 30, 2007 was
    $151.6 million (net of attorney fees, payments due to other

Amounts represent items that have been expensed as incurred or
    accrued in accordance with GAAP. These amounts do not include
    gross litigation settlement income recorded during fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005 of $28.5 million, $27.0 million and
    $41.7 million, respectively, which were recorded as special
    items.

Future
    Spend

Certain acquisition and restructuring costs are based upon
    estimates. Actual amounts paid may ultimately differ from these
    estimates. If additional costs are incurred or recorded amounts
    exceed costs, such changes in estimates will be recorded in
    special items when incurred.

The Company estimates it will incur additional costs in future
    periods associated with various acquisitions and restructuring
    activities totaling approximately $73.1 million
    (approximately $46.2 million net of tax). These estimated
    costs are primarily associated with the relocation of the
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical
    segment’s headquarters to the Company’s corporate
    headquarters and the integration of Viasys. The Company believes
    it will incur these costs to properly restructure, integrate and
    rationalize operations, a portion of which represents facility
    rationalizations and implementing efficiencies regarding
    information systems, customer systems, marketing programs and
    administrative functions, among other things. Such amounts are
    estimates and will be expensed as special items when incurred.

Impairment
    Charges and Other

The Company classifies certain asset impairments related to
    restructurings in special items. Asset impairments and gains and
    losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as
    special items or discontinued operations are classified within
    impairment charges and other within the consolidated statements
    of earnings. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    incurred impairment charges and other of $17.3 million,
    $5.8 million and $38.3 million, respectively. These
    asset impairment charges are included within the Corporate
    segment’s results.

During fiscal 2007, the only significant charge was an
    impairment of approximately $12.3 million related to a
    certain investment (see Note 4 for additional information).
    During fiscal 2006, the only significant charge was
    approximately $6.2 million related to the loss on sale of a
    significant portion of the Company’s specialty distribution
    business (see Note 8 for additional information). With
    respect to the significant asset impairments recorded during
    fiscal 2005, the Company incurred the following: impairments of
    approximately $18.2 million related to lease

agreements for certain real estate and equipment used in the
    operations of the Company; and impairments of $7.2 million
    relating to a decision to write-off certain internally developed
    software.

INVESTMENTS

At June 30, 2007, the Company held approximately
    $132.0 million in tax exempt auction rate securities. At
    June 30, 2006, the Company held approximately
    $208.9 million in tax exempt variable rate demand notes and
    approximately $289.5 million in tax exempt auction rate
    securities. These short-term investments are classified as
    available-for-sale on the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet. The interest rate earned on the Company’s current
    investments resets every 28 or 35 days and the investments
    are automatically reinvested unless the Company provides notice
    of intent to liquidate to the broker. The Company’s
    investments in these securities are recorded at cost, which
    approximates fair market value due to their variable interest
    rates. The underlying maturities of the current investments
    range from one to 33 years. The bonds are issued by
    municipalities and other tax exempt entities. Most are backed by
    letters of credit from the banking institutions that broker the
    debt placements or another financial institution. All of the
    current investments have ratings of at least Aaa or AAA.

At June 30, 2006, the Company held a $16.7 million
    cost investment in Global Healthcare Exchange, LLC
    (“GHX”). During the three months ended
    December 31, 2006, a valuation of GHX was performed by an
    independent third-party in conjunction with a business
    transaction initiated by GHX. Based on the results of the
    valuation, the Company determined the investment was impaired
    and recorded a $12.3 million charge to impairment charges
    and other within the consolidated statement of earnings. At
    June 30, 2007, the investment held was $4.4 million.
    The Company will continue to monitor GHX’s financial
    performance in order to assess for additional impairment.

ACCOUNTS
    RECEIVABLE

Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the
    Company through its distribution businesses within the
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical and
    the Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical
    segments and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful
    accounts of $118.8 million and $104.7 million at
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. An account is
    considered past due on the first day after its due date. In
    accordance with contract terms, the Company generally has the
    ability to charge customer service fees or higher prices if an
    account is considered past due. The Company continuously
    monitors past due accounts and establishes appropriate reserves
    to cover potential losses. The Company will write-off any
    amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance
    for doubtful accounts.

The Company provides financing to various customers. Such
    financing arrangements range from approximately 90 days to
    10 years, at interest rates that generally are subject to
    fluctuation. Interest income on these accounts is recognized by
    the Company as it is earned. The financings may be
    collateralized, guaranteed by third parties or unsecured.
    Finance notes and accrued interest receivables were
    $35.5 million and $32.7 million at June 30, 2007
    and 2006, respectively, (current portions were
    $15.6 million and $27.8 million, respectively) and are
    included in other assets. During fiscal 2006, the Company sold
    certain notes to a bank. See Note 13 for additional
    information. Finance notes receivable are reported net of an
    allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.3 million and
    $15.1 million at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company has formed special purpose entities with the sole
    purpose of buying receivables or sales-type leases from various
    legal entities of the Company and selling those receivables or
    sales-type leases to certain multi-seller conduits administered
    by banks or other third-party investors. See Note 19 for
    additional disclosure regarding off-balance sheet financing.

During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to
    periodically sell trade receivables to a special purpose
    accounts receivable and financing entity (the “Accounts
    Receivable and Financing Entity”) which is exclusively
    engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and making loans
    to, the Company. The Accounts

Receivable and Financing Entity, which is consolidated by the
    Company, issued $250 million and $400 million in
    preferred variable debt securities to parties not affiliated
    with the Company during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively. As
    part of an amendment to certain of the facility terms of the
    preferred debt securities in October 2006, the Company repaid
    $500.0 million of the principal balance. See Note 10
    for additional information.

INVENTORIES

A substantial portion of inventories (approximately 73% and 75%
    at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively) are stated at
    the lower of cost, using the LIFO method, or market. These
    inventories are included within the core distribution facilities
    within the Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services -
    Pharmaceutical segment (“core distribution
    facilities”) and are primarily merchandise inventories. The
    Company believes that the average cost method of inventory
    valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current
    cost of replacing inventory within the core distribution
    facilities. As such, the LIFO reserve is the difference between
    (a) inventory at the lower of LIFO cost or market and
    (b) inventory at replacement cost determined using the
    average cost method of inventory valuation. In fiscal 2007, the
    Company did not record any LIFO reserve reductions. In 2006, the
    Company recorded LIFO reserve reductions of $26.0 million.

The remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of
    cost, using the FIFO method, or market. If the Company had used
    the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory
    within the core distribution facilities, inventories would not
    have changed in fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. In fact, primarily
    due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical
    inventories, inventories at LIFO were $55.8 million and
    $1.0 million higher than the average cost value as of
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. However, the
    Company’s policy is not to record inventories in excess of
    its current market value.

Inventories recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory
    which were $95.8 million and $112.2 million at
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company reserves
    for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical
    experiences, sales trends, specific categories of inventory and
    age of on-hand inventory.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

PTS
    Business

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company committed
    to plans to sell the PTS Business, thereby meeting the held for
    sale criteria set forth in SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.” In accordance with SFAS No. 144 and EITF
    Issue

No. 03-13,

“Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB
    Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, in Determining Whether to Report
    Discontinued Operations,” the net assets of the PTS
    Business are presented separately as held for sale and the
    operating results are presented within discontinued operations
    for all periods presented. The net assets held for sale of the
    PTS Business are included within the Corporate segment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company completed
    the sale of the PTS Business to Phoenix Charter LLC
    (“Phoenix”), an affiliate of The Blackstone Group,
    pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement between the Company
    and Phoenix, dated January 25, 2007, as amended (the
    “Purchase Agreement”). At the closing of the sale, the
    Company received approximately $3.2 billion in cash from
    Phoenix, which was the purchase price of approximately
    $3.3 billion as adjusted pursuant to certain provisions in
    the Purchase Agreement for the working capital, cash,
    indebtedness and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization of the PTS Business. The Company recognized an
    after-tax book gain of approximately $1.1 billion from this
    transaction.

    operations for the PTS Business was $22.9 million,
    $8.2 million and $6.8 million for fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

    PTS Business was $25.0 million, $25.1 million and
    $21.8 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Interest expense was allocated based upon a ratio of the
    invested capital of the PTS Business versus the overall invested
    capital of the Company. In addition, a portion of the corporate
    costs previously allocated to the PTS Business has been
    reclassified to the remaining four segments. Prior period

During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company committed
    to plans to sell the HMS Disposal Group and IPD, thereby meeting
    the held for sale criteria set forth in SFAS No. 144.
    The remaining portion of the healthcare marketing services
    business remains within the Company. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 144 and EITF Issue

No. 03-13,

the net assets of these businesses are presented separately as
    held for sale and the operating results of these businesses are
    presented within discontinued operations. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, the net assets held for sale of each
    business were recorded at the net expected fair value less costs
    to sell, as this amount was lower than the business’ net
    carrying value.

Impairment charges of $30.0 million and $171.0 million
    were recorded in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, within
    discontinued operations for the HMS Disposal Group. In the third
    quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company completed the sale of the
    HMS Disposal Group. The net assets held for sale of the HMS
    Disposal Group at June 30, 2006 are included within the
    Corporate segment.

Impairment charges of $17.3 million and $66.4 million
    were recorded in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, within
    discontinued operations for IPD. In the first quarter of fiscal
    2007, the Company completed the sale of IPD. The net assets held
    for sale of IPD at June 30, 2006 are included within the
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    segment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company decided to
    close its sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing business in
    Humacao, Puerto Rico as part of its global restructuring program
    and committed to sell the assets of the Humacao operations,
    thereby meeting the held for sale criteria set forth in
    SFAS No. 144. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2005, the Company recognized an impairment charge to write the
    carrying value of the Humacao assets down to fair value, less
    costs to sell. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the
    Company subsequently decided not to transfer production from
    Humacao to other Company-owned facilities, thereby meeting the
    criteria for classification of discontinued operations in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144 and EITF Issue

No. 03-13.

An impairment charge of $5.2 million was recorded in fiscal
    2007 as a result of recording the net assets held for sale to
    the net expected fair value less costs to sell. Humacao’s
    net assets at June 30, 2007 and 2006 are included within
    the Corporate segment.

In connection with the acquisition of Syncor, the Company
    acquired certain operations of Syncor that were discontinued.
    Prior to the acquisition, Syncor announced the discontinuation
    of certain operations, including the medical imaging business
    and certain overseas operations. The Company continued with
    these plans and added additional international and non-core
    domestic businesses to the discontinued operations. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 144 and EITF Issue

No. 03-13,

the results of operations of these businesses were presented as
    discontinued operations. The Company sold all of the remaining
    Syncor discontinued operations prior to the end of fiscal 2005.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
    gain of approximately $18.7 million related to the sale of
    the radiation management services business within the
    Company’s Healthcare Supply Chain Services - Pharmaceutical
    segment. This business unit was not previously classified as
    discontinued operations because it did not qualify in accordance
    with SFAS No. 144 and EITF Issue

No. 03-13

until the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The assets and
    liabilities were not classified as held for sale and the results
    of operations related to this business were not classified as
    discontinued operations as the amounts were not significant.

The increase within the Medical Products Manufacturing segment
    primarily relates to the acquisition of Viasys resulting in a
    preliminary goodwill allocation of $1.0 billion, which is
    offset by Denver Biomedical, Inc. purchase accounting
    adjustments of $16.7 million.

(8)

At the end of fiscal 2006, the Company divided the businesses
    previously reported within the Medical Products and Services
    segment into the Healthcare Supply Chain Services —
    Medical and Medical Products Manufacturing segments to better
    align business operations. The transfer is an adjustment to the
    goodwill initially allocated between these new segments.

The allocations of the purchase prices related to the Viasys and
    other acquisitions are not yet finalized and are subject to
    adjustment as the Company assesses the value of the
    pre-acquisition contingencies and certain other matters. The
    Company expects any future adjustments to the allocations of the
    purchase prices and potential future contingent payments to be
    recorded to goodwill.

The 4.00%, 5.65%, 5.80%, 5.85%, 6.00%, 6.25% and
    6.75% Notes and the Floating Rate Notes due 2009 represent
    unsecured obligations of the Company. The 7.30% Notes and
    the 7.80% and 7.00% Debentures represent unsecured
    obligations of Allegiance Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary
    of the Company), which are guaranteed by the Company. These
    obligations are not subject to a sinking fund and are not
    redeemable prior to maturity. Interest is paid pursuant to the
    terms of the obligations. These notes and guarantees of the
    Company are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the
    Company’s subsidiaries, including trade payables of
    $9.2 billion.

In October 2006, the Company sold $350.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of floating rate notes due 2009 (the “2009
    Notes”) and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount
    of fixed rate notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) in a
    private offering. The 2009 Notes mature on October 2, 2009
    and interest on these notes will accrue at a floating rate equal
    to the three-month LIBOR plus 0.27% payable quarterly. The 2016
    Notes mature on October 15, 2016 and interest on the 2016
    Notes accrue at 5.80% per year payable semi-annually. The
    Company also agreed for the benefit of the holders to register
    the 2009 and 2016 Notes under the U.S. Securities Act of
    1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to a
    registered exchange offer so that such Notes may be sold in the
    public market. Because the Company did not meet certain
    deadlines for completion of the exchange offer, the interest
    rates on the



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2009 and 2016 Notes increased by 25 basis points as of
    June 1, 2007 and will increase by an additional
    25 basis points as of August 30, 2007 if the exchange
    offer is not completed prior to that date. Upon the completion
    of the exchange offer, such additional interest on the 2009 and
    2016 Notes will no longer be payable. The maximum amount of
    additional interest which the Company must pay prior to the
    completion of the exchange offer for the 2009 and 2016 Notes is
    50 basis points per year. The Company used the proceeds
    from the sale of the 2009 and 2016 Notes to repay
    $500.0 million of the Company’s preferred debt
    securities, $127.4 million of 7.30% Notes due 2006,
    $53.1 million outstanding under a short-term credit
    facility of a subsidiary guaranteed by the Company and for
    general corporate purposes.

In a second private offering in June 2007, the Company sold
    $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate
    notes due 2012 (the “2012 Notes”) and
    $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate
    notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). The 2012 Notes
    mature on June 15, 2012 and the 2017 Notes mature on
    June 15, 2017. Interest on the 2012 Notes and the 2017
    Notes accrue at 5.65% and 6.00%, respectively, per year payable
    semi-annually. If the Company experiences specific types of
    change of control, it may be required to offer to purchase the
    2012 and 2017 Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
    repurchase. The Company also agreed for the benefit of the
    holders to register the 2012 and 2017 Notes under the Securities
    Act pursuant to a registered exchange offer so that such Notes
    may be sold in the public market. If the Company does not meet
    certain deadlines for completion of the exchange offer, the
    interest rates on the 2012 and 2017 Notes will increase by
    25 basis points as of February 4, 2008 and will
    increase by an additional 25 basis points as of
    March 4, 2008 if the exchange offer is not completed prior
    to that date. Upon the completion of the exchange offer, such
    additional interest on the 2012 and 2017 Notes would no longer
    be payable. The maximum amount of additional interest which the
    Company would have to pay prior to the completion of the
    exchange offer for the 2012 and 2017 Notes is 50 basis
    points per year. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale
    of the 2012 and 2017 Notes to fund a portion of the purchase
    price of the Viasys acquisition and for other general corporate
    purposes.

As part of the Company’s acquisition of Alaris in fiscal
    2004, the Company assumed $195.3 million of
    7.25% Senior subordinated notes due 2011. During fiscal
    2005, the Company paid off $183.6 million of the Senior
    subordinated notes. On July 2, 2007, the Company exercised
    the option to call the Senior subordinated notes resulting in
    the repayment of the remaining balance of $11.2 million.

During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to
    periodically sell trade receivables to a special purpose
    accounts receivable and financing entity, which is exclusively
    engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and making loans
    to, the Company (the “Accounts Receivable and Financing
    Entity”). The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity,
    which is consolidated by the Company as it is the primary
    beneficiary of the variable interest entity, issued
    $250.0 million and $400.0 million in preferred
    variable debt securities to parties not affiliated with the
    Company during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively. These
    preferred debt securities are classified as “long-term
    obligations, less current portion and other short-term
    obligations” in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet. The Company amended certain of the facility terms of the
    Company’s preferred debt securities in October 2006. As
    part of this amendment, the Company repaid $500.0 million
    of the principal balance with a portion of the proceeds of the
    October 2006 offering described above and added a minimum net
    worth covenant whereby the minimum net worth of the Company
    cannot fall below $5.0 billion at any time. The amendment
    eliminated a minimum adjusted net worth covenant (adjusted
    tangible net worth could not fall below $2.5 billion) and
    certain financial ratio covenants. After the repayment, the
    Company had $150.0 million outstanding under its preferred
    debt securities. At June 30, 2007 and 2006, the Accounts
    Receivable and Financing Entity owned approximately
    $594.7 million and $580.8 million, respectively, of
    receivables that are included in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet. The effective interest rate as of June 30,
    2007 and 2006 was 5.94% and 5.90%, respectively. Other than for
    loans made to the Company or for breaches of certain
    representations, warranties or covenants, the Accounts
    Receivable and Financing Entity does not have any recourse
    against the general credit of the Company.

In addition to cash, at June 30, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company’s sources of liquidity included a $1.5 billion
    and $1.0 billion commercial paper program, respectively,
    backed by a $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion revolving
    credit facility for the respective years. The Company initiated
    a $1.0 billion commercial paper program in August 2006,
    which replaced its former $1.5 billion commercial paper
    program. The Company increased the commercial paper program to
    $1.5 billion on February 28, 2007. The Company had no
    outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program at
    June 30, 2007 or 2006. In January 2007, the Company amended
    certain terms of the revolving credit facility. As part of the
    amendment, the amount of the facility was increased from
    $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion and the term was extended
    to January 24, 2012. At expiration, this facility can be
    extended upon mutual consent of the Company and the lending
    institutions. This revolving credit facility exists largely to
    support issuances of commercial paper as well as other
    short-term borrowings for general corporate purposes and
    remained unused at June 30, 2007 and 2006, except for
    $79.2 million and $57.8 million, respectively, of
    standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company.
    Additionally, at June 30, 2006, the Company maintained a
    $150.0 million extendible commercial note program with no
    outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2006. The Company
    terminated the $150.0 million extendible commercial note
    program in February 2007.

The Company also maintained other short-term credit facilities
    and an unsecured line of credit that allowed for borrowings up
    to $131.1 million and $307.2 million at June 30,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. At June 30, 2007 and 2006,
    $29.0 million and $161.8 million, respectively, were
    outstanding under uncommitted facilities, of which
    $25.1 million at June 30, 2006 related to the PTS
    Business. The June 30, 2007 and 2006 outstanding balance
    under uncommitted facilities included $4.1 million and
    $136.6 million, which was classified in other obligations
    at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining
    $20.2 million and $21.8 million balance of other
    obligations at June 30, 2007, and 2006, respectively,
    consisted primarily of additional notes, loans and capital
    leases. Additionally, in March 2007, the Company entered into a
    $500.0 million unsecured committed short term loan
    facility, which was terminated in April 2007.

A provision of the AJCA created a temporary incentive for
    U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned
    abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for
    certain dividends from

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined
    that it would repatriate $500.0 million of accumulated

non-U.S. earnings

in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the
    AJCA, and accordingly the Company recorded a related tax
    liability of $26.3 million as of June 30, 2005. The
    maximum repatriation available to the Company was
    $500.0 million under the repatriation provisions of the
    AJCA. During fiscal 2006, the Company repatriated
    $494.0 million of qualifying accumulated foreign earnings
    in accordance with its plan adopted during fiscal 2005. An
    additional tax liability of $0.4 million was recorded
    during fiscal 2006 due to new state legislation with respect to
    the AJCA, bringing the Company’s total tax liability
    related to the repatriation recorded through June 30, 2006
    to $26.7 million. Uses of repatriated funds included
    domestic expenditures related to non-executive salaries, capital
    asset investments and other permitted activities.

As of June 30, 2007, the Company had $2.4 billion of
    undistributed earnings from

non-U.S. subsidiaries

that are intended to be permanently reinvested in

non-U.S. operations.

Because these earnings are considered permanently reinvested, no
    U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the
    repatriation of these earnings. It is not

practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might
    be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. At
    June 30, 2007, a liability of $4.0 million was
    established related to the estimated cost of repatriating
    $18.0 million of undistributed earnings from Viasys

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between
    financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and
    liabilities, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for

    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At June 30, 2007, the Company had gross federal, state and
    international loss and credit carryforwards of
    $361.0 million, $1.1 billion and $147.0 million,
    respectively, the tax effect of which is an aggregate deferred
    tax asset of $178.2 million. The significant increase in
    loss carryforwards during fiscal 2007 is attributable to a tax
    capital loss on the PTS Business divestiture estimated at
    $127.1 million. This capital loss carrryforward has a full
    $127.1 million valuation allowance and can be carried
    forward five years. This PTS Business capital loss estimate and
    related valuation allowance are subject to change based on
    results of the U.S. federal capital loss disallowance rules
    review that will be conducted before the June 2007 tax returns
    are filed. Substantially all of the remaining carryforwards are
    available for at least three years or have an indefinite
    carryforward period. Approximately $155.6 million of the
    valuation allowance at June 30, 2007 applies to certain
    federal, international, and state and local carryforwards that,
    in the opinion of management, are more likely than not to expire
    unutilized. However, to the extent that tax benefits related to
    these carryforwards are realized in the future, the reduction in
    the valuation allowance would be applied against income tax
    expense.

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to
    U.S. federal or

non-U.S. income

tax audits by tax authorities for fiscal years ending before
    June 30, 2001. The years subsequent to fiscal 2000 contain
    matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of
    applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount

and/or

timing of income, deductions and tax credits. The Internal
    Revenue Service (“IRS”) currently has ongoing
    examinations of open years from 2001 through 2005. Although the
    outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes
    that adequate amounts of tax and interest have been provided for
    any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.
    While it is not currently possible to predict the impact of
    settlements or other IRS audit activity on income tax expense or
    cash flows during the next 12 months, the Company does not
    expect any significant impact on financial position.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company is required to
    adopt the provisions of FIN No. 48, “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in the financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    This standard also provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain
    tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not
    that the position will be sustained upon examination, including
    resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes,
    based on the technical merits. The amount recognized is measured
    as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon settlement. This interpretation
    also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. The Company is currently
    assessing the impact of adopting FIN No. 48 on its
    consolidated financial statements.

Legal
    Proceedings

Shareholder
    Litigation against Cardinal Health

Since July 2, 2004, multiple purported class action
    complaints were filed by putative purchasers of the
    Company’s securities against the Company and certain of its
    current and former officers and directors, asserting claims
    under the federal securities laws. All of these actions were
    filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of Ohio, where, on December 15, 2004, they were
    consolidated into a single proceeding referred to as

In re
    Cardinal Health, Inc. Federal Securities Litigation

(the
    “Cardinal Health federal securities litigation”). On
    January 26, 2005, the Court appointed the Pension
    Fund Group as lead plaintiff. On April 22, 2005, the
    lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint naming the
    Company, certain current and former officers and employees and
    the Company’s external auditors as defendants.

The Cardinal Health federal securities litigation purports to be
    brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s
    securities during various periods beginning as early as
    October 24, 2000 and ending as late as July 26, 2004.
    The consolidated amended complaint alleges, among other things,
    that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
    Act”), and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange
    Act by issuing a series of false

and/or

misleading statements concerning the Company’s financial
    results, prospects and condition. The alleged misstatements
    relate to the Company’s accounting for recoveries relating
    to antitrust litigation against vitamin manufacturers,
    classification of revenue in the Company’s pharmaceutical
    supply chain business (formerly referred to as the
    pharmaceutical distribution business) as either operating
    revenue or revenue from bulk deliveries to customer warehouses,
    and other accounting and business model transition issues,
    including reserve accounting. The alleged misstatements are
    claimed to have caused an artificial inflation in the
    Company’s stock price during the proposed class period. The
    consolidated amended complaint seeks unspecified money damages
    and other unspecified relief against the defendants.

On March 27, 2006, the Court granted a Motion to Dismiss
    with respect to the Company’s external auditors and a
    former officer and denied the Motion to Dismiss with respect to
    the Company and the other individual defendants. On
    December 12, 2006, the parties stipulated that the case
    could proceed as a class action with a class comprised of all
    persons other than Company officers or directors who purchased
    or otherwise acquired the Company’s stock during the class
    period.

The Company entered into a memorandum of understanding effective
    on May 24, 2007 to settle the Cardinal Health federal
    securities litigation. Under the memorandum of understanding,
    the Cardinal Health federal securities litigation will be
    terminated for a payment of $600 million. The Company
    established a reserve of $600 million for the quarter ended
    March 31, 2007 and transferred the $600 million into
    an escrow account on May 25, 2007. The Company has entered
    into a stipulation of settlement with counsel for the
    plaintiffs, which was filed with the Court on July 27,
    2007. On July 31, 2007, the Court entered an Order
    preliminarily approving the settlement.

The defendants in the Cardinal Health federal securities
    litigation continue to deny the violations of law alleged in the
    litigation, and the settlement reached is solely to eliminate
    the uncertainties, burden and expense of further protracted
    litigation. The final settlement is subject to certain
    conditions, including notice to the class of plaintiffs in the
    Cardinal Health federal securities litigation and court
    approval. At this time, there can be no assurance that all of
    the conditions for settlement will be met or that the settlement
    will receive final court approval.

ERISA
    Litigation against Cardinal Health

Beginning in July 2004, multiple purported class action
    complaints were filed against the Company and certain of its
    officers, directors and employees by purported participants in
    the Cardinal Health Profit Sharing, Retirement



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and Savings Plan (now known as the Cardinal Health 401(k)
    Savings Plan, or the “Plan”). All of these actions
    were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of Ohio, where, on December 15, 2004, they were
    consolidated into a single proceeding referred to as

In re
    Cardinal Health, Inc. ERISA Litigation

(the “Cardinal
    Health ERISA litigation”). On January 14, 2005, the
    Court appointed lead counsel and liaison counsel for the
    Cardinal Health ERISA litigation. On April 29, 2005, the
    lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended ERISA complaint
    naming the Company, certain current and former directors,
    officers and employees, the Company’s Employee Benefits
    Policy Committee and Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company as
    defendants.

The Cardinal Health ERISA litigation purports to be brought on
    behalf of participants in the Plan. The consolidated amended
    complaint alleges that the defendants breached certain fiduciary
    duties owed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (“ERISA”), generally asserting that the defendants
    failed to make full disclosure of the risks to the Plan’s
    participants of investing in the Company’s stock, to the
    detriment of the Plan’s participants and beneficiaries, and
    that Company stock should not have been made available as an
    investment alternative for the Plan’s participants. The
    misstatements alleged in the Cardinal Health ERISA litigation
    significantly overlap with the misstatements alleged in the
    Cardinal Health federal securities litigation. The consolidated
    amended complaint seeks unspecified money damages and equitable
    relief against the defendants and an award of attorney’s
    fees.

On March 31, 2006, the Court granted the defendants’
    Motion to Dismiss the consolidated complaint with respect to
    Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company (the former trustee of the
    Plan) and with respect to plaintiffs’ claim for equitable
    relief. The Court denied the remainder of the Motion to Dismiss
    filed by the Company and certain defendants. On
    September 8, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for
    Class Certification, seeking certification of a class of
    Plan participants who bought or held Company shares in their
    Plan accounts between October 24, 2000 and July 2,
    2004.

In May 2007, the Company reached an understanding with the
    counsel for the plaintiffs regarding a proposed settlement of
    the Cardinal Health ERISA litigation under which the litigation
    would be terminated for a payment by the Company of
    $40 million. As a result, the Company recorded a reserve of
    $40 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. On
    June 21, 2007, the Company entered into a class action
    settlement agreement with counsel for the plaintiffs. The
    settlement agreement provides that the Cardinal Health ERISA
    litigation will be terminated for a payment by the Company to
    the Plan of $40 million, with the net proceeds of the
    settlement to be apportioned to the Plan accounts of
    participants who bought or held Company shares in their Plan
    accounts between October 24, 2000 and July 2, 2004.

The defendants in the Cardinal Health ERISA litigation continue
    to deny the violations of law alleged in the litigation, and the
    settlement reached is solely to eliminate the uncertainties,
    burden and expense of further protracted litigation. The final
    settlement is subject to certain conditions, including notice to
    the class of plaintiffs in the Cardinal Health ERISA litigation,
    approval by an independent fiduciary on behalf of the Plan and
    court approval. The Court granted preliminary approval of the
    settlement on June 28, 2007 and the Company transferred the
    $40.0 million into an escrow account on June 29, 2007.
    At this time, there can be no assurance that all of the
    conditions for settlement will be met or that the settlement
    will receive final court approval.

Derivative
    Actions

On November 8, 2002, a complaint was filed by a purported
    shareholder against the Company and its directors in the Court
    of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, as a purported
    derivative action.

Doris Staehr v. Robert D. Walter et
    al.,

No. 02-CV-11-639

.
    On or about March 21, 2003, after the defendants filed a
    Motion to Dismiss the complaint, an amended complaint was filed
    alleging breach of fiduciary duties and corporate waste in
    connection with the alleged failure by the Board of Directors of
    the Company to renegotiate or terminate the Company’s
    proposed acquisition of Syncor, and to determine the propriety
    of indemnifying Monty Fu, the former Chairman of Syncor. The
    defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint, and
    the plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint
    that added three new individual defendants and included new
    allegations that, among



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

other things, the defendants improperly recognized revenue in
    December 2000 and September 2001 related to settlements with
    certain vitamin manufacturers. The defendants filed a Motion to
    Dismiss the second amended complaint, and on November 20,
    2003, the Court denied the motion. On May 31, 2006, the
    plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint, which now mirrors
    most of the substantive allegations of the consolidated amended
    complaint filed in the Cardinal Health federal securities
    litigation. The complaint seeks money damages and equitable
    relief against the defendant directors and an award of
    attorney’s fees. Discovery has been proceeding.

Since July 1, 2004, three complaints have been filed by
    purported shareholders against the members of the Company’s
    Board of Directors, certain of the Company’s current and
    former officers and employees and the Company as a nominal
    defendant in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio,
    as purported derivative actions (collectively referred to as the
    “Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions”).
    These cases include

Donald Bosley v. David Bing et al.,
    No. 04 CV A07-7167, Sam Weitschner v. Dave Bing et
    al., No. 04 CV C08-8970,

and

Green Meadow Partners,
    LLP v. David Bing et al., No. 04 CV H09-9891

. The
    Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions allege, among
    other things, that the individual defendants failed to implement
    adequate internal controls for the Company and thereby violated
    their fiduciary duty of good faith, GAAP and the Company’s
    Audit Committee charter. The complaints in the Cardinal Health
    Franklin County derivative actions seek money damages and
    equitable relief against the defendant directors and an award of
    attorney’s fees. On November 22, 2004, the Cardinal
    Health Franklin County derivative actions were transferred to be
    heard by the same judge. On June 20, 2006, the plaintiffs
    filed a consolidated amended complaint that raises many of the
    same substantive allegations as the consolidated amended
    complaint filed in the Cardinal Health federal securities
    litigation and the Weed complaint discussed below.

On September 27, 2006, a derivative complaint was filed by
    a purported shareholder against certain members of the Human
    Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board
    of Directors, certain of the Company’s current and former
    officers and the Company as a nominal defendant in the Court of
    Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio, as a purported derivative
    action.

Barry E. Weed v. John F. Havens, et al.,
    No. 06 CV H09 12620.

The complaint alleges that the
    individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties with
    respect to the timing of the Company’s option grants in
    August 2004 and that the officer defendants were unjustly
    enriched with respect to such grants. The complaint seeks money
    damages, disgorgement of options, equitable relief and costs and
    disbursements of the action, including attorney’s fees.

On June 29, 2007, the Company and other parties to
    litigation described below entered into a memorandum of
    understanding to settle the Staehr derivative action, the
    Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions and the Weed
    derivative action (collectively, the “Derivative
    Actions”). In addition to the plaintiffs and the Company,
    the parties to the memorandum of understanding include all
    individual named defendants in the Derivative Actions,
    consisting of the following current and former executives and
    directors: David Bing, George H. Conrades, John F. Finn, Robert
    L. Gerbig, John F. Havens, J. Michael Losh, John B. McCoy,
    Richard C. Notebaert, Michael D. O’Halleran, David W.
    Raisbeck, Jean G. Spaulding, Matthew D. Walter, Robert D.
    Walter, William E. Bindley, Regina E. Herzlinger, Melburn G.
    Whitmire, George L. Fotiades, James F. Millar, Mark W. Parrish,
    Richard J. Miller, Ronald K. Labrum and Anthony J. Rucci.

Under the memorandum of understanding, in full and final
    settlement of all claims in the Derivative Actions, the
    individual defendants will cause proceeds from their applicable
    directors and officers insurance policies totaling
    $70 million to be paid to the Company, less an amount not
    more than $12 million as is approved by court order for
    plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs. See the
    discussion below under the heading “Insurance Coverage for
    Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Cardinal Health and
    Derivative Actions” for more information regarding the
    insurance proceeds. Upon final court approval of the settlement,
    the Company expects to recognize its net proceeds from the
    settlement as income within special items in its consolidated
    statement of earnings.

The memorandum of understanding further provides that the
    Company and its board of directors will adopt a corporate
    governance enhancement requiring the audit committee of the
    board to meet in executive session with the Company’s Chief
    Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer no less than annually.
    Also under the memorandum of



CARDINAL

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

understanding, each plaintiff in the Derivative Actions and the
    Company will grant each of the individual defendants and
    employees, agents and representatives of the Company a
    comprehensive release and covenant not to sue, as broad as
    permissible under the law, that with certain narrow exceptions
    will cover all claims by or on behalf of the Company that are or
    could have been asserted in the Derivative Actions that arise
    out of or in connection with or are related to any of the acts,
    matters or transactions referred to in the Derivative Actions.

The individual defendants in the Derivative Actions continue to
    deny the violations of law alleged in those actions, and the
    settlement will acknowledge that the individual defendants are
    entering into the settlement solely to eliminate the
    uncertainties, burden and expense of further protracted
    litigation. The settlement is subject to completion of
    definitive documentation and other conditions, including notice
    to shareholders, approval by all necessary courts and formal,
    final dismissal of all the Derivative Actions. At this time,
    there can be no assurance that those conditions will be met or
    that the settlement will receive final court approval.

In connection with the settlement and in order to consolidate
    the Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions, on
    July 18, 2007, plaintiffs in these actions filed a joint
    complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Ohio
    that was nearly identical to the consolidated amended complaint
    plaintiffs had previously filed in the Court of Common Pleas of
    Franklin County, Ohio. Under procedures discussed with the
    Delaware County Court, the Company expects that after defendants
    answer the Delaware County complaint, the Franklin County
    complaint will be dismissed.

On August 1, 2007, the plaintiff in the Weed derivative
    action filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas for
    Delaware County, Ohio that was substantially identical to
    plaintiff’s pending Franklin County complaint. The Company
    expects that after defendants answer the Delaware County
    complaint, the plaintiff will dismiss the Franklin County action
    and seek to proceed on a consolidated basis in Delaware County
    with the Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions and
    the Staehr derivative action both described above.

Insurance
    Coverage for Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Cardinal
    Health and Derivative Actions

Some insurance coverage is available to the Company and
    individuals who were named as defendants in the legal
    proceedings described under the headings “Shareholder
    Litigation against Cardinal Health” and “Derivative
    Actions.” On October 12, 2006, a complaint was filed
    by the Federal Insurance Company (“Federal”) against
    the Company and certain of its current and former members of the
    board of directors, officers

and/or

employees in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio.

Federal Insurance Company v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et
    al., No. 06CVH10 13447.

Among other things, the
    complaint sought a determination from the Court of
    Federal’s rights and obligations, if any, under successive
    directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies
    issued by Federal with respect to the Cardinal Health federal
    securities litigation and various state-court shareholder
    derivative lawsuits. The complaint also sought a declaration
    that no coverage exists with respect to the Cardinal Health
    ERISA litigation under successive fiduciary liability insurance
    policies issued by Federal. On January 26, 2007, the
    Company and the individual defendants filed their respective
    answers and counterclaims and sought to add additional insurers
    as counterclaim defendants, leave for which was granted on
    March 14, 2007. The Company expects to file amended
    counterclaims against two additional insurance companies. As a
    result of the settlements described in the following paragraph,
    Federal, along with the three other settling insurance
    companies, have been or will be dismissed from the lawsuit.

The Company has entered into settlement agreements with Federal
    and three other insurance companies. Under these agreements, the
    four insurance companies have agreed to pay an aggregate amount
    of $94 million, which would be available as appropriate for
    the benefit of the Company and the individuals who are
    defendants in the Cardinal Health federal securities litigation
    and the Derivative Actions. From the $94 million,
    $70 million will be used in connection with settling the
    Derivative Actions. In addition, approximately $4 million
    of the proceeds was paid to the Company during the fiscal year
    ended June 30, 2007 to defray previously incurred legal
    expenses. The Company will not receive or record the remaining
    $20 million of insurance proceeds unless and until
    definitive settlement agreements have been finalized and
    executed and allocation of such proceeds among the defendants
    has

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

been determined. The Company believes that it has additional
    insurance coverage available from other carriers to partially
    satisfy its defense costs and liabilities in these matters, but
    any such additional coverage is likely to be immaterial in
    amount.

Shareholder/ERISA
    Litigation against Syncor

Eleven purported class action lawsuits have been filed against
    Syncor and certain of its officers and directors, asserting
    claims under the federal securities laws. All of these actions
    were filed in the United States District Court for the Central
    District of California, where they were consolidated into a
    single proceedings referred to as

In re Syncor International
    Corp. Securities Litigation

(the “Syncor federal
    securities litigation”). The lead plaintiff filed a third
    amended consolidated complaint on December 29, 2004. The
    Syncor federal securities litigation purport to be brought on
    behalf of all purchasers of Syncor shares during various
    periods, beginning as early as March 30, 2000 and ending as
    late as November 5, 2002, all prior to the Company’s
    acquisition of Syncor. The litigation alleges, among other
    things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the
    Exchange Act and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange
    Act by issuing a series of press releases and public filings
    disclosing significant sales growth in Syncor’s
    international business, but omitting mention of certain
    allegedly improper payments to Syncor’s foreign customers,
    thereby artificially inflating the price of Syncor shares. The
    consolidated complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other
    unspecified relief against the defendants. Syncor filed a Motion
    to Dismiss the third amended consolidated complaint on
    January 31, 2005. On April 15, 2005, the Court granted
    the Motion to Dismiss with prejudice and the lead plaintiff
    appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Ninth Circuit. On June 12, 2007, the Ninth Circuit
    entered an order reversing, in part, the District Court’s
    dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claims and remanding the case
    to the District Court. The order reversed the dismissal of the
    claims against Syncor and certain individual defendants,
    including its former Chairman and CEO, and affirmed the
    dismissal of all other defendants. Syncor filed a Petition for
    Rehearing on June 26, 2007, which is pending.

A purported class action complaint, captioned

Pilkington v. Cardinal Health, et al.,

was filed on
    April 8, 2003 against the Company, Syncor and certain
    officers and employees of the Company by a purported participant
    in the Syncor Employee Savings and Stock Ownership Plan. A
    related purported class action complaint, captioned

Donna
    Brown, et al. v. Syncor International Corp, et al.,

was
    filed on September 11, 2003 against the Company, Syncor and
    certain individual defendants. Another related purported class
    action complaint, captioned

Thompson v. Syncor
    International Corp., et al.

, was filed on January 14,
    2004 against the Company, Syncor and certain individual
    defendants. Each of these actions was brought in the United
    States District Court for the Central District of California. A
    consolidated complaint was filed on February 24, 2004
    against Syncor and certain former Syncor officers, directors

and/or

employees alleging that the defendants breached certain
    fiduciary duties owed under ERISA based on the same underlying
    allegations of improper and unlawful conduct alleged in the
    federal securities litigation. The consolidated complaint seeks
    unspecified money damages and other unspecified relief against
    the defendants. On April 26, 2004, the defendants filed
    Motions to Dismiss the consolidated complaint. On
    August 24, 2004, the Court granted in part and denied in
    part defendants’ Motions to Dismiss. The Court dismissed,
    without prejudice, all claims against two individual defendants,
    all claims alleging co-fiduciary liability against all
    defendants, and all claims alleging that the individual
    defendants had conflicts of interest precluding them from
    properly exercising their fiduciary duties under ERISA. A claim
    for breach of the duty to prudently manage plan assets against
    Syncor was not dismissed, and a claim for breach of the alleged
    duty to “monitor” the performance of Syncor’s
    Plan Administrative Committee against defendants Monty Fu and
    Robert Funari was not dismissed. On January 10, 2006, the
    Court entered summary judgment in favor of all defendants on all
    remaining claims. Consistent with that ruling, on
    January 11, 2006, the Court entered a final order
    dismissing this case and the lead plaintiff appealed this
    decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
    Circuit.

It is not currently possible to estimate the amount of loss or
    range of possible loss that might result from an adverse
    judgment or a settlement of the proceedings described under the
    heading “Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Syncor.”
    However, the Company currently does not believe that the impact
    of these proceedings will have a



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations or financial condition. The Company currently
    believes that there will be some insurance coverage available
    under the Company’s and Syncor’s insurance policies.
    Such policies are with financially viable insurance companies,
    and are subject to self-insurance retentions, exclusions,
    conditions, any potential coverage defenses or gaps, policy
    limits and insurer solvency.

ICU
    Litigation

Prior to the completion of the Company’s acquisition of
    Alaris, on June 16, 2004, ICU Medical, Inc.
    (“ICU”) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against
    Alaris in the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of California. In the lawsuit, ICU claims that the
    Alaris
    SmartSite

®

family of needle-free valves and systems infringes upon ICU
    patents. ICU seeks monetary damages plus permanent injunctive
    relief to prevent Alaris from selling SmartSite products. On
    July 30, 2004, the Court denied ICU’s application for
    a preliminary injunction finding, among other things, that ICU
    had failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the
    merits. During July and August 2006, the Court granted summary
    judgment to Alaris on three of the four patents asserted by ICU
    and issued an order interpreting certain claims in certain
    patents in a manner that could impair ICU’s ability to
    enforce those patents against Alaris. On January 22, 2007,
    the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Alaris on all of
    ICU’s remaining claims and declared certain of their patent
    claims invalid. On June 28, 2007, the Court ordered ICU to
    pay Alaris $4.8 million of attorneys’ fees and costs.
    These decisions are subject to appeal. The Company intends to
    continue to vigorously defend this action. It is currently not
    possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible
    loss that might result from an adverse judgment or settlement of
    this proceeding. However, the Company currently does not believe
    that this proceeding will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

SEC
    Investigation and U.S. Attorney Inquiry

On October 7, 2003, the Company received a request from the
    SEC, in connection with an informal inquiry, for historical
    financial and related information, which was subsequently
    converted into a formal investigation. The SEC’s request
    sought a variety of documentation, including the Company’s
    accounting records for fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003, as well
    as notes, memoranda, presentations,

e-mail

and
    other correspondence, budgets, forecasts and estimates. On
    June 21, 2004, as part of the SEC’s formal
    investigation, the Company received an SEC subpoena that
    included a request for the production of documents relating to
    revenue classification, and the methods used for such
    classification, in the Company’s pharmaceutical supply
    chain business as either “Operating Revenue” or
    “Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other.” In
    addition, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney’s
    Office for the Southern District of New York had also commenced
    an inquiry. On October 12, 2004, the Company received a
    subpoena from the SEC requesting the production of documents
    relating to compensation information for specific current and
    former employees and officers of the Company. The Company was
    notified in April 2005 that certain current and former employees
    and directors received subpoenas from the SEC requesting the
    production of documents.

In connection with the SEC’s informal inquiry, the
    Company’s Audit Committee commenced its own internal review
    in April 2004, assisted by independent counsel. This internal
    review was prompted by documents contained in the production to
    the SEC that raised issues as to certain accounting and
    financial reporting matters, including, but not limited to, the
    establishment and adjustment of certain reserves and their
    impact on the Company’s quarterly earnings. The Audit
    Committee and its independent counsel also reviewed the revenue
    classification issue that was the subject of the SEC’s
    June 21, 2004 subpoena and other matters identified in the
    course of the Audit Committee’s internal review. During
    September and October 2004, the Audit Committee reached certain
    conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review.
    In connection with the Audit Committee’s conclusions
    reached in September and October 2004, the Company made certain
    reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004
    and prior historical consolidated financial statements. The
    Audit Committee’s conclusions were disclosed, and the
    reclassification and restatement adjustments were reflected, in
    the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 (the “2004

Form 10-K”)

and subsequent public reports filed by the Company.

    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Following the conclusions reached by the Audit Committee in
    September and October 2004, the Audit Committee began the task
    of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters
    described above which were reflected in the 2004

Form 10-K,

and, in January 2005, took disciplinary actions with respect to
    the Company’s employees who it determined bore
    responsibility for these matters, other than with respect to the
    accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
    manufacturers for which there was a separate Board committee
    internal review that has been completed (discussed below). The
    disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of
    employment to required repayments of some or all of fiscal 2003
    bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand. These
    disciplinary actions affected senior financial and managerial
    personnel, as well as other personnel, at the corporate level
    and in the then four business segments. The Audit Committee has
    completed its determinations of responsibility for the financial
    statement matters described above which were reflected in the

Form 10-K,

although responsibility for matters relating to the
    Company’s accounting treatment of certain recoveries from
    vitamin manufacturers was addressed by a separate committee of
    the Board as discussed below.

In connection with the SEC’s formal investigation, a
    committee of the Board of Directors, with the assistance of
    independent counsel, separately initiated an internal review to
    assign responsibility for matters relating to the Company’s
    accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
    manufacturers. In the 2004

Form 10-K,

as part of the Audit Committee’s internal review, the
    Company reversed its previous recognition of estimated
    recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in
    prior years and recognized the income from such recoveries as a
    special item in the period in which cash was received from the
    manufacturers. The SEC staff had previously advised the Company
    that, in its view, the Company did not have an appropriate basis
    for recognizing the income in advance of receiving the cash. In
    August 2005, the separate Board committee reached certain
    conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review
    and determined that no additional disciplinary actions were
    required beyond the disciplinary actions already taken by the
    Audit Committee, as described above.

On July 26, 2007, the Company announced a settlement with
    the SEC that concludes, with respect to the Company, the SEC
    investigation. In connection with the settlement, the SEC filed
    a complaint against the Company in the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint
    alleges violations of several provisions of the federal
    securities laws, including the anti-fraud provisions, relating
    principally to the Company’s financial reporting and
    disclosures. The Company agreed, without admitting or denying
    the allegations of the complaint, to consent to entry of a final
    judgment to be entered by the Court. The final judgment, which
    was entered by the Court on August 2, 2007, among other
    things, enjoined the Company from future violations of the
    federal securities laws and required the Company to pay a civil
    penalty of $35 million and retain an independent consultant
    to review certain company policies and procedures. The Company
    has paid the civil penalty and retained the independent
    consultant. The Company had reserved $35 million relating
    to the settlement of this matter in the quarters ended
    June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2005.

In July 2007, the Company was informed by the
    U.S. Attorney’s Office that its investigation had been
    closed.

The settlement with the SEC does not resolve the investigation
    by the SEC of the activities of certain current and former
    members of the Company’s management, which investigation is
    ongoing. In January 2007, the Company learned that its Executive
    Chairman of the Board, as well as four former officers and
    employees, received “Wells” notices from the staff of
    the SEC. Under SEC procedures, a Wells notice indicates that the
    SEC staff has made a preliminary decision to recommend that the
    SEC commence a civil or administrative action against the
    recipient of the notice. The recipient of a Wells notice has the
    opportunity to respond to the SEC staff before the staff makes
    its formal recommendation on whether any civil action should be
    brought by the SEC. The Company is continuing to cooperate with
    the SEC in this investigation. The outcome of the continuing SEC
    investigation and any related legal and administrative
    proceedings could include the institution of administrative or
    civil injunctive proceedings involving current or former Company
    employees, officers

and/or

directors, as well as the imposition of fines and other
    penalties, remedies and sanctions upon such persons.

Alaris
    SE Pump Recall

On August 15, 2006, the Company initiated a voluntary field
    corrective action of its
    Alaris

®

SE pump as a result of information indicating that the product
    had a risk of “key bounce” associated with keypad
    entries that could lead to over-infusion of patients. On
    August 23, 2006, the United States filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California
    to effect the seizure of Alaris SE pumps and the Company
    suspended production, sales, repairs and installation of the
    pumps after approximately 1,300 units were seized by the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”).

On February 8, 2007, a Consent Decree for Condemnation and
    Permanent Injunction (the “Consent Decree”) between
    the Company and the FDA was entered by the District Court to
    resolve the seizure litigation. The Consent Decree outlines the
    steps the Company must take to resume manufacturing and selling
    Alaris SE pumps in the United States. The steps include
    submitting a plan to the FDA outlining corrections for the
    Alaris SE pumps currently in use by customers, submitting a
    reconditioning plan for the seized Alaris SE pumps, and engaging
    an independent expert to inspect Alaris SE pump facilities and
    certify the Company’s infusion pump operations. The
    corrective action and reconditioning plans must be approved by
    the FDA prior to implementation by the Company. On
    March 30, 2007, the Company received the FDA’s
    approval of its corrective action plan for the Alaris SE pumps
    currently in use by customers. On April 19, 2007, the
    Company received the FDA’s approval of its reconditioning
    plan for the Alaris SE pumps that were seized.

There have been approximately 140,000 Alaris SE pumps
    distributed worldwide during the past 12 years and the
    product line currently represents less than 1% of annual revenue
    for the Clinical Technologies and Services segment. The Company
    recorded a $13.5 million charge related to this matter
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company has begun
    taking the steps necessary to comply with the terms of the
    Consent Decree and does not believe that compliance with the
    Consent Decree will materially affect its results of operations
    or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that
    additional costs or penalties will not be incurred, the effect
    of which could be material to the Company’s results of
    operations.

State
    Attorneys General Investigation related to Repackaged
    Pharmaceuticals

In October 2005, the Company received a subpoena from the
    Attorney General’s Office of the State of Illinois. The
    subpoena stated that the Illinois Attorney General’s Office
    is examining whether the Company presented or caused to be
    presented false claims for payment to the Illinois Medicaid
    program relating to repackaged pharmaceuticals. The Company
    received a letter in May 2007 that was sent jointly from the
    Illinois and New York Attorney General’s Offices on
    behalf of a National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units
    team. The letter alleges that the Company has caused Medicaid
    reimbursements to be paid for repackaged pharmaceuticals without
    paying the required Medicaid rebate and alleges that certain of
    the Company’s repackaging business practices violate the
    Medicaid rebate statute. The letter requests the Company to
    change these business practices, asks for additional information
    and asserts potential theories for damages. The Company is
    providing requested information to the state attorney general
    offices and is participating in ongoing discussions with these
    offices regarding this matter, including whether changes to
    business practices are required. The Company cannot currently
    predict the outcome of this investigation or its ultimate impact
    on the Company’s business and cannot estimate the amount of
    loss or range of possible loss.

Other
    Matters

In addition to the matters described above, the Company also
    becomes involved from time-to-time in other litigation and
    regulatory matters incidental to its business, including,
    without limitation, personal injury claims, employment matters,
    commercial disputes, intellectual property matters, inclusion of
    certain of its subsidiaries as a potentially responsible party
    for environmental

clean-up

costs, and litigation in connection with acquisitions. The
    Company intends to vigorously defend itself against such other
    litigation and does not currently believe that the



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

outcome of any such other litigation will have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and government
    agencies continue to scrutinize certain practices affecting
    government programs and otherwise. From time to time, the
    Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from
    various government agencies, including from state attorneys
    general, the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice relating to
    the business, accounting or disclosure practices of customers or
    suppliers. The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and
    requests in a timely and thorough manner, which responses
    sometimes require considerable time and effort, and can result
    in considerable costs being incurred, by the Company. The
    Company expects to incur additional costs in the future in
    connection with existing and future requests.

13.

GUARANTEES

The Company has contingent commitments related to certain
    operating lease agreements (see Note 19). These operating
    leases consist of certain real estate used in the operations of
    the Company. In the event of termination of these operating
    leases, which mature in June 2013, the Company guarantees
    reimbursement for a portion of any unrecovered property cost. At
    June 30, 2007, the maximum amount the Company could be
    required to reimburse was $120.9 million. In accordance
    with FIN No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
    Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
    Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”, the Company recorded
    a liability of $2.9 million as of June 30, 2007
    related to these agreements. The Company’s maximum amount
    to be reimbursed decreased significantly during fiscal 2007 due
    to the Company’s decision to repurchase certain buildings,
    equipment and land of approximately $51.2 million which
    were previously under lease agreements. Of this total amount
    repurchased, $44.2 million related to the PTS Business.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company, from time to
    time, agrees to indemnify certain other parties under agreements
    with the Company, including under acquisition and disposition
    agreements, customer agreements and intellectual property
    licensing agreements. Such indemnification obligations vary in
    scope and, when defined, in duration. In many cases, a maximum
    obligation is not explicitly stated and, therefore, the overall
    maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification
    obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate,
    such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability.
    Historically, the Company has not, individually or in the
    aggregate, made payments under these indemnification obligations
    in any material amounts. In certain circumstances, the Company
    believes that its existing insurance arrangements, subject to
    the general deduction and exclusion provisions, would cover
    portions of the liability that may arise from these
    indemnification obligations. In addition, the Company believes
    that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered
    under these indemnification obligations is not significant.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company, from time to
    time, enters into agreements that obligate the Company to make
    fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events. Such
    obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under
    acquisition transactions, where the Company has agreed to make
    payments based upon the achievement of certain financial
    performance measures by the acquired business. Generally, the
    obligation is capped at an explicit amount. The Company’s
    aggregate exposure for these obligations, assuming the
    achievement of all financial performance measures, is not
    material. Any potential payment for these obligations would be
    treated as an adjustment to the purchase price of the related
    entity and would have no impact on the Company’s results of
    operations.

In the ordinary course of business, the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment of the Company, from
    time to time, extends loans to its customers which are
    subsequently sold to a bank. The bank services and administers
    these loans as well as any new loans the Company may direct. In
    order for the bank to purchase such loans, it requires the
    absolute and unconditional obligation of the Company to
    repurchase such loans upon the occurrence of certain events
    described in the agreement including, but not limited to,
    borrower payment default that exceeds 90 days, insolvency
    and bankruptcy. In the event of default, in addition to
    repurchasing the



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

loans, the Company must repay any premium that was received in
    advance of the bank’s collection of the loan. At
    June 30, 2007 and 2006, notes in the program subject to the
    guarantee of the Company totaled $36.7 million and
    $35.1 million, respectively. At June 30, 2007 and
    2006, accruals for premiums received in advance of the
    bank’s collection of notes were $0.8 million and
    $0.6 million, respectively.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

Interest Rate Risk Management.

The Company is
    exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. The
    Company’s objective is to manage the impact of interest
    rate changes on cash flows and the market value of its
    borrowings. The Company utilizes a mix of debt maturities along
    with both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage changes in
    interest rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest
    rate swaps to further manage its exposure to interest rate
    variations related to its borrowings and to lower its overall
    borrowing costs.

At June 30, 2007, the Company held no pay-fixed interest
    rate swaps. During fiscal 2007, the Company held six pay-fixed
    interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of cash flows
    related to forecasted transactions. Four of these contracts
    matured through 2012 (“2012 Contracts”) and the other
    two contracts matured through 2016 (“2016 Contracts”).
    These contracts were all terminated during fiscal 2007,
    resulting in cash receipts totaling $3.4 million for the
    2012 Contracts and cash payments totaling $3.4 million for
    the 2016 Contracts. The ineffective portion of the 2012
    Contracts, totaling a gain of $0.1 million, was recorded in
    interest expense and other during fiscal 2007. The ineffective
    portion of the 2016 Contracts, totaling a loss of
    $0.1 million, was recorded in interest expense and other
    during fiscal 2007. The remaining amounts that relate to the
    portion of the contracts that were effective were recorded to
    other comprehensive income during fiscal 2007, and an adjustment
    is being recognized in interest expense and other in conjunction
    with the occurrence of the originally forecasted transactions.

At June 30, 2006, the Company held no pay-fixed interest
    rate swaps. The pay-fixed interest rate swaps held at
    June 30, 2005 were terminated in September 2005 as the
    forecasted transactions related to the swaps did not occur at
    that time, and thus, a portion of each of the contracts became
    ineffective. The termination of these contracts resulted in a
    cash receipt of $1.2 million. The ineffective portion of
    the contracts, totaling less than a $0.1 million loss, was
    recorded in interest expense and other during fiscal 2006.
    During fiscal 2006, the Company held two other pay-fixed
    interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of cash flows
    related to forecasted transactions. These contracts matured
    through 2010 and 2017, respectively. These contracts were also
    terminated resulting in a cash receipt of $12.7 million.
    The ineffective portion of the contracts, totaling a gain of
    $2.7 million, was recorded in interest expense and other
    during fiscal 2006. The remaining amounts that relate to the
    portion of the contracts that were effective were recorded to
    other comprehensive income during fiscal 2006, and an adjustment
    is being recognized in interest expense and other in conjunction
    with the occurrence of the originally forecasted transactions.

The Company also holds pay-floating interest rate swaps to hedge
    the change in fair value of the fixed-rate debt related to
    fluctuations in interest rates. These contracts are classified
    as fair value hedges and mature through June 2017. The
    gain/(loss) recorded on the pay-floating interest rate swaps is
    directly offset by the change in fair value of the underlying
    debt. Both the derivative instrument and the underlying debt are
    adjusted to market value at the end of each period with any
    resulting gain/(loss) recorded in interest expense and other.

The following table shows the notional amount hedged and fair
    value of the interest rate swaps outstanding at June 30,
    2007 and 2006 included in other assets/liabilities (in
    millions). The net gains/(losses) for pay-floating interest rate
    swaps recognized through interest expense and other during
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were approximately
    $(11.2) million, $(6.4) million, and
    $22.7 million, respectively.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company had net deferred gains on pay-fixed interest rate
    swaps of $0.9 million and $0.8 million recorded in
    other comprehensive income at June 30, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. During fiscal 2007, the Company incurred losses of
    $0.3 million. During fiscal 2006, the Company incurred
    gains of less than $0.1 million. During fiscal 2005 the
    Company recognized losses of approximately $0.7 million
    within interest expense and other related to these interest rate
    swaps.

The counterparties to these contracts are major financial
    institutions and the Company does not have significant exposure
    to any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is
    remote and in any event would not be material.

Currency Risk Management.

The Company conducts
    business in several major international currencies and is
    subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange
    rates. The Company’s objective is to reduce earnings and
    cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate
    changes to allow management to focus its attention on its
    business operations. Accordingly, the Company enters into
    various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates
    change to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets
    and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency
    revenue and expenses. The gains and losses on these contracts
    offset changes in the value of the underlying transactions as
    they occur.

At June 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company held forward
    contracts expiring through June 2008 and June 2007,
    respectively, to hedge probable, but not firmly committed,
    revenue and expenses. These hedging contracts are classified as
    cash flow hedges and, accordingly, are adjusted to current
    market values through other comprehensive income until the
    underlying transactions are recognized. Upon recognition, such
    gains and losses are recorded in operations as an adjustment to
    the recorded amounts of the underlying transactions in the
    period in which these transactions are recognized. The principal
    currencies hedged are the Canadian dollar, European euro,
    Mexican peso, Thai baht, British pound, and Australian dollar.

The Company also held other forward contracts expiring through
    December 2013 at June 30, 2007 and 2006 to manage its
    foreign exchange exposure of foreign currency assets and
    liabilities subject to revaluation. These instruments do not
    meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment and are
    adjusted to current market values through interest expense and
    other.

The following table represents the notional amount hedged and
    the value of the forward contracts outstanding at June 30,
    2007 and 2006 included in other assets or liabilities (in

“Forward contracts — other” refers to
    forward contracts used to manage the Company’s foreign
    exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and
    other balance sheet items subject to revaluation which do not
    meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. The amount
    of net losses related to these instruments recognized through
    interest expense and other during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005
    were approximately $19.5 million, $9.7 million, and
    $12.4 million, respectively. The income/(loss) recorded on
    these instruments is substantially offset by the remeasurement
    adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or
    liability.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The settlement of the derivative instrument and the
    remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated
    asset or liability are both recorded in interest expense and
    other at the end of each period.

At June 30, 2007, the Company had net deferred losses
    related to forward contract cash flow hedges of
    $3.5 million as compared to net deferred losses of
    $4.6 million at June 30, 2006. These gains and losses
    were recorded in other comprehensive income. During fiscal 2007,
    the Company recognized losses of approximately $2.9 million
    within net earnings related to these forward contracts. During
    fiscal 2006, the Company recognized gains of approximately
    $6.9 million within net earnings related to these forward
    contracts. The Company did not recognize any material
    gains/(losses) related to contracts that were not effective or
    forecasted transactions that did not occur during fiscal 2007
    and 2006.

The counterparties to these contracts are major financial
    institutions and the Company does not have significant exposure
    to any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is
    remote and in any event would not be material.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, trade receivables,
    accounts payable, notes payable-banks, other short-term
    borrowings and other accrued liabilities at June 30, 2007
    and 2006, approximate their fair value because of the short-term
    maturities of these items.

Cash balances are invested in accordance with the Company’s
    investment policy. These investments are exposed to market risk
    from interest rate fluctuations and credit risk from the
    underlying issuers, although this is mitigated through
    diversification.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term
    obligations was $3,475.5 million and $2,783.6 million
    as compared to the carrying amounts of $3,473.3 million and
    $2,787.6 million at June 30, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The fair value of the Company’s long-term
    obligations is estimated based on either the quoted market
    prices for the same or similar issues and the current interest
    rates offered for debt of the same remaining maturities or
    estimated discounted cash flows.

The following is a summary of the fair value gain/(loss) of the
    Company’s derivative instruments, based upon the estimated
    amount that the Company would receive (or pay) to terminate the
    contracts as of June 30, 2007 and 2006 (in millions). The
    fair values are based on quoted market prices for the same or
    similar instruments.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

The Company’s operations are principally managed on a
    products and services basis. As discussed above in Note 1,
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company realigned
    its operations into the following reportable segments:
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical;
    Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical; Clinical
    Technologies and Services; Pharmaceutical Technologies and
    Services and Medical Products Manufacturing. This change in
    segment reporting resulted from a realignment of the individual
    businesses to better correlate the operations of the Company
    with the needs of its customers. The factors for determining the
    reportable segments included the manner in which management
    evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the
    nature of the individual business activities. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,” all prior period
    segment information was reclassified to conform to this new
    financial reporting presentation.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company committed
    to plans to sell the PTS Business thereby meeting the held for
    sale criteria set forth in SFAS No. 144. The Company
    completed the sale of the PTS Business during the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007. In accordance with SFAS No. 144 and
    EITF Issue

No. 03-13,

the assets and liabilities of the PTS Business are presented
    separately as held for sale in prior periods and the operating
    results are

    remaining reportable segments are: Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical; Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Medical; Clinical Technologies and
    Services; and Medical Products Manufacturing. Prior period
    results were adjusted to reflect this change. See Note 8
    for additional information.

The Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Pharmaceutical
    segment provides logistics services to the pharmaceutical
    industry, distributing products and providing services to
    retail, alternate care and hospital pharmacies. These services
    include a pharmaceutical repackaging and distribution program
    for independent and chain drug store customers as well as
    alternate care customers in the mail order business. This
    segment also operates centralized nuclear pharmacies, provides
    third-party logistics support services, distributes therapeutic
    plasma to hospitals, clinics and other providers located in the
    United States and manufactures and markets generic
    pharmaceutical products for sale to hospitals, clinics and
    pharmacies in the United Kingdom. This segment also operates a
    specialty pharmacy and franchises and operates apothecary-style
    retail pharmacies.

The Healthcare Supply Chain Services — Medical segment
    provides integrated supply chain and logistics solutions to
    healthcare customers in the United States and Canada. These
    solutions include sterile and non-sterile kitting and
    distribution of medical surgical products into hospitals,
    surgery centers, laboratories and physician offices.

The Clinical Technologies and Services segment develops,
    manufactures, leases and sells medical technologies products for
    hospitals and other healthcare providers, including intravenous
    medication safety and infusion therapy delivery systems,
    software applications, needle-free disposables and related
    patient monitoring equipment and dispensing systems that
    automate the distribution and management of medications in
    hospitals and other healthcare facilities. The segment also
    develops, manufactures, leases and sells dispensing systems for
    medical supplies and provides pharmacy services and clinical
    intelligence solutions.

The Medical Products Manufacturing segment’s revenue is

Corporate revenue primarily consists of the elimination of
    inter-segment revenue.

The Company evaluates the performance of the segments based on
    segment profit. Segment profit is segment revenue less segment
    cost of products sold, less segment selling, general and
    administrative expenses. Segment SG&A expenses include
    allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including
    corporate management, corporate finance, financial shared
    services, human resources, information technology, legal and
    legislative affairs and the integrated sales organization.
    Corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based upon
    headcount, level of benefit provided and ratable allocation.
    Information about interest income and expense and income taxes
    is not provided at the segment level. In addition, special
    items, impairment charges and other and investment spending are
    not allocated to the segments (see below for an explanation of
    investment spending). See Note 3 for further discussion of
    the Company’s special items and impairment charges and

During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, corporate operating earnings
    include special items, impairment charges and other and certain
    other Corporate investment spending described below:

(a)

Special items: Corporate operating earnings include special
    items of $772.0 million, $80.5 million and
    $141.5 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively
    (see Note 3 for discussion of special items).

(b)

Impairment charges and other: See Note 3 for further
    discussion of impairment charges and other.

(c)

Investment spending: The Company has encouraged its segments to
    identify investment projects which will provide future returns.
    These projects typically require incremental strategic
    investments in the form of additional capital or operating
    expenses. As approval decisions for such projects are dependent
    upon Corporate executive management, the expenses for such
    projects are retained at the Corporate segment. Investment
    spending for fiscal years, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $22.3 million, $18.9 million and $17.5 million,
    respectively.

EMPLOYEE
    EQUITY AND SAVINGS PLANS

Employee
    Equity Plans

The Company maintains several stock incentive plans
    (collectively, the “Plans”) for the benefit of certain
    of its officers, directors and employees. Prior to fiscal 2006,
    employee options granted under the Plans typically vested in
    full on the third anniversary of the grant date and were
    exercisable for periods up to ten years from the date of grant
    at a price equal to the fair market value of the Common Shares
    underlying the option at the date of grant. Employee options
    granted under the Plans during fiscal 2007 and 2006 generally
    vest in equal annual installments over four years and are
    exercisable for periods up to seven years from the date of grant
    at a price equal to the fair market value of the Common Shares
    underlying the option at the date of grant. Under the Plans the
    Company currently utilizes for equity award grants, the Company
    was authorized to grant up to 19.5 million shares as of
    June 30, 2007, of which 6.9 million shares have been
    granted.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,”
    applying the modified prospective method. This Statement
    requires all equity-based payments to employees, including
    grants of employee options, to be recognized in the consolidated
    statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the
    award. Under the modified prospective method, the Company is
    required to record equity-based compensation expense for all
    awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested
    portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date
    of adoption.

The fair values of options granted after the Company adopted
    this Statement were determined using a lattice valuation model
    and all options granted prior to adoption of this Statement were
    valued using a Black-Scholes model. The Company believes the
    lattice model provides for better estimates as it has the
    ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on
    changes in the Company’s stock price and other variables
    and it provides for a range of input assumptions. In
    anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company did not modify the terms of any previously-granted
    options.

    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair values of restricted shares and restricted share units
    is determined by the number of shares granted and the grant date
    market price of the Company’s Common Shares. The
    compensation expense recognized for all equity-based awards is
    net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized using the
    straight-line method over the awards’ service period. In
    accordance with SAB No. 107, the Company classified
    equity-based compensation within selling, general and
    administrative expenses to correspond with the same line item as
    the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees.

In accordance with FASB Staff Position
    No. FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to
    Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
    Awards,” issued in November 2005, the Company elected the
    specified “shortcut” method to calculate its beginning
    pool of additional paid-in capital related to equity-based
    compensation. This accounting policy election had no impact on
    the Company’s financial statements.

The following table illustrates the impact of equity-based
    compensation on reported amounts for the fiscal years ended
    June 30, 2007 and 2006 (in millions, except per share

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal

    $124.8 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value
    of options outstanding at June 30,



CARDINAL
    HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2007 and June 30, 2006 are approximately
    $493.8 million and $462.9 million, respectively. The
    aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable at
    June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006 are approximately
    $228.1 million and $216.2 million, respectively. The
    weighted average fair value of options granted during fiscal
    2007, 2006 and 2005 are $21.29, $18.79, and $16.89,
    respectively. Total equity-based compensation expense, net of
    estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options not yet
    recognized as of June 30, 2007 and 2006 was
    $103.0 million and $131.3 million, respectively.

The fair values of the options granted to the Company’s
    employees and directors during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were
    estimated on the date of grant using a lattice valuation model.
    The lattice valuation model incorporates ranges of assumptions
    that are disclosed in the table below. The risk-free rate is
    based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of
    the grant. The Company analyzed historical data to estimate
    option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used
    within the lattice model. The Company calculated separate option
    valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar
    historical exercise behaviors. The expected life of the options
    granted was calculated from the option valuation model and
    represents the length of time in years that the options granted
    are expected to be outstanding. The range of expected lives in
    the table below results from the separate groups of employees
    identified by the Company based on their option exercise
    behaviors. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatility
    from traded options on the Company’s Common Shares and
    historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with
    the contractual term of the option grant (7 years). The
    following table provides the range of assumptions used for
    options valued during fiscal 2007 and 2006:



Risk-free interest rate

4.5% - 5.1%

3.3% - 5.1%

The fair value of the options granted to Company employees and

    using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    assumptions for grants:

The Company’s restricted shares and share units are
    expensed over the awards’ service period, generally three
    years. As of June 30, 2007 and 2006, approximately
    1.9 million and 1.7 million shares and share units
    remained restricted and subject to forfeiture, respectively.
    Total equity-based compensation expense, net of estimated
    forfeitures, related to unvested restricted shares and share
    units not yet recognized was $45.9 million and
    $12.8 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2007 and
    $29.9 million and $10.7 million, respectively, as of
    June 30, 2006.

The Company has employee stock purchase plans under which the
    sale of 12.0 million Common Shares has been authorized.
    Employees who have been employed by the Company for at least
    30 days may be eligible to contribute from 1% to 15% of
    eligible compensation. The purchase price is determined by the
    lower of 85% of the closing market price on the first day of the
    offering period or 85% of the closing market price on the last
    day of the offering period. During any given calendar year,
    there are two offering periods: January 1 — June 30;
    and July 1 — December 31. At June 30, 2007,
    subscriptions of 0.4 million shares were outstanding.
    Through June 30, 2007, 5.5 million shares had been
    issued to employees under the plans.

Fair
    Value Disclosures — Prior to adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R)

Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company accounted
    for equity-based awards in accordance with APB No. 25, and
    related interpretations. Except for costs related to restricted
    shares, restricted share units, stock appreciation rights and an
    insignificant number of amended options requiring a new
    measurement date, no compensation expense was recognized in net
    earnings, as all options granted had an exercise price equal to
    the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
    The following tables illustrate the effect on net earnings (in
    millions) and earnings per share for the fiscal year ended
    June 30, 2005 if the Company adopted the fair value

    matching and profit sharing contributions. The Company’s
    contributions to the plans are determined by the Board of

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company periodically enters into certain off-balance sheet
    arrangements, primarily receivable sales and operating leases,
    in order to maximize diversification of funding and return on
    assets. The receivable sales, as described below, also provide
    for the transfer of credit risk to third parties.

Lease
    Receivable-Related Arrangements

A subsidiary of the Company has agreements to transfer ownership
    of certain equipment lease receivables, plus security interests
    in the related equipment, to the leasing subsidiary of a bank.
    In order to qualify for sale treatment under
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,” the Company formed wholly-owned, special
    purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries (the “Pyxis
    SPEs”) of its subsidiary, Cardinal Health Solutions, Inc.
    (“Pyxis”), and each of the Pyxis SPEs formed
    wholly-owned, qualified special purpose subsidiaries (the
    “QSPEs”) to effectuate the removal of the lease
    receivables from the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, the
    Company consolidates the Pyxis SPEs and does not consolidate the
    QSPEs. Both the Pyxis SPEs and QSPEs are separate legal entities
    that maintain separate financial statements from the Company and
    Pyxis. The assets of the Pyxis SPEs and QSPEs are available
    first and foremost to satisfy the claims of their respective
    creditors.

Other
    Receivable-Related Arrangements

Cardinal Health Funding, LLC (“CHF”) was organized for
    the sole purpose of buying receivables and selling undivided
    interests in those receivables to multi-seller conduits
    administered by third-party banks or other third-party
    investors. CHF was designed to be a special purpose,
    bankruptcy-remote entity. Although consolidated in accordance
    with GAAP, CHF is separate legal entity from the Company, and
    the Company’s subsidiary that sells and contributes the
    receivables to CHF. The sale of receivables by CHF qualifies for
    sales treatment under SFAS No. 140 and accordingly the
    receivables are not included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

At June 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company had a committed
    receivables sales facility program available through CHF with
    capacity to sell $800.0 million in receivables. Recourse is
    provided under the program by the requirement that CHF retain a
    percentage subordinated interest in the sold receivables. In
    October 2006, the Company repurchased the aggregate
    $550.0 million of receivable interests under its committed
    receivables sales facility program. On October 31, 2006,
    the Company renewed the receivables sales facility program for a
    period of one year. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the
    Company sold and subsequently repurchased $150.0 million of
    receivable interests under this receivable sales facility
    program. The Company did not have any receivable interest sales
    outstanding under its receivables sales facility program at
    June 30, 2007 and had $550.0 million of receivable
    interest sales at June 30, 2006. The Company provided a
    security interest in its residual interest in the receivables of
    $265.5 million at June 30, 2006, as required under
    this program.

Operating
    Leases

The Company has entered into an operating lease agreement with a
    third-party bank for the construction of various facilities and
    equipment. The lease agreement matures in June 2013. In the
    event of termination, the Company is required (at its election)
    to either repurchase the facility or vacate the property and
    make reimbursement for a portion of any unrecovered property
    cost. The maximum portion of unrecovered property costs that the
    Company could be required to reimburse was $120.9 million
    at June 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, the amount
    expended to acquire

and/or

construct the facilities was $151.2 million. The agreement
    provides for maximum funding of $245.0 million, which is
    currently greater than the estimated cost to complete the
    construction projects. The required lease payments equal the
    interest expense for the period on the amounts drawn.

During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased certain buildings,
    equipment and land of approximately $51.2 million which
    were previously under operating lease agreements. Of this total
    amount repurchased, approximately $44.2 million related to
    the PTS Business. Lease payments under the agreements are based
    primarily upon LIBOR and are subject to interest rate
    fluctuations. As of June 30, 2007, the weighted average
    interest rate on the agreements approximated 6.25%. The
    Company’s estimated minimum annual lease payments under the
    agreements at June 30, 2007 were approximately
    $9.5 million.

(a) an adjustment of approximately $15.3 million
    related to the acceleration of the vesting conditions for all
    unvested equity awards held by the Company’s Executive
    Chairman of the Board. The acceleration of the equity-based
    compensation resulted from his second amended and restated
    employment agreement, dated April 17, 2006, which
    relinquished the service period related to his unvested equity
    awards;

(b) an adjustment of approximately $10.0 million
    related to excess inventory from a particular pharmaceutical
    manufacturer within the Healthcare Supply Chain
    Services — Pharmaceutical segment; and

(c) an adjustment of $7.3 million for the current year
    impact for the Company’s long-term incentive cash program
    for fiscal years 2006 through 2008.

As discussed in Note 3, special items were recognized in
    each quarter of fiscal 2007 and 2006. The following table
    summarizes the impact of such costs on net earnings (in
    millions) and diluted earnings per Common Share in the quarters
    in which they were recorded. The sum of the quarters may not

Changes
    in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A:

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures

.

The Company carried out an
    evaluation, as required by

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, with the participation of the
    Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2007.
    Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
    as of June 30, 2007 to provide reasonable assurance that
    information required to be disclosed in the Company’s
    reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC rules and forms and to provide that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

.

Management is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control
    system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    preparation and fair presentation of published financial
    statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
    effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
    financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate or be circumvented.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
    2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the “COSO criteria”). Based on
    management’s assessment and the COSO criteria, management
    believes that the Company maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation
    report on management’s assessment of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. Ernst &
    Young LLP’s report appears below under this Item 9A
    and expresses unqualified opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

.

There were no changes in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
    the quarter ended June 30, 2007 that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its
    internal control over financial reporting.

Implementation of New Accounting Software
    System

.

In July 2007, the Company began
    processing selected financial transactions for its corporate
    functions and the Clinical Technologies and Services segment on
    a newly implemented accounting software system. This change of
    systems is designed to streamline and integrate the
    Company’s financial close and reporting processes by
    reducing the number of platforms used to record and report
    financial information, improving efficiency by reducing the
    amount of manual activity, and improving the control environment
    by reducing variability in the financial policies, processes and
    systems. All fiscal 2007 accounting was performed on the
    Company’s prior systems so this change had no impact on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting for the
    fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

The Company will transition selected financial processes within
    its other segments to the new accounting software system
    throughout fiscal 2008 and 2009. As a result of the transition
    that has already occurred in the corporate functions and at the
    Clinical Technologies and Services segment, and the transition
    that will occur at other segments, certain internal controls
    have changed or will change to support new financial processes.

Limitations on Control Systems

.

The
    Company’s management, including its principal executive
    officer and the principal financial officer, does not expect
    that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and
    its



internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud.
    A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
    objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
    a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
    fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
    be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the control. The design of any system of controls also is based
    in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
    succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
    conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
    changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
    limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
    due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. The
    Company monitors its disclosure controls and procedures and
    internal controls and makes modifications as necessary; the
    Company’s intent in this regard is that the disclosure
    controls and procedures and the internal controls will be
    maintained as dynamic systems that change (including with
    improvements and corrections) as conditions warrant.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF
    MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The Shareholders and the

Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting,” that Cardinal Health, Inc. and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
    2007, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
    criteria). The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of June 30, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, based
    on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Cardinal Health, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    June 30, 2007 and our report dated August 22, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
